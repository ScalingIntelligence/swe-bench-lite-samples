-There are three types of functions implemented in SymPy:
-
-    1) defined functions (in the sense that they can be evaluated) like
-       exp or sin; they have a name and a body:
-           f = exp
-    2) undefined function which have a name but no body. Undefined
-       functions can be defined using a Function class as follows:
-           f = Function('f')
-       (the result will be a Function instance)
-    3) anonymous function (or lambda function) which have a body (defined
-       with dummy variables) but have no name:
-           f = Lambda(x, exp(x)*x)
-           f = Lambda((x, y), exp(x)*y)
-    The fourth type of functions are composites, like (sin + cos)(x); these work in
-    SymPy core, but are not yet part of SymPy.
-
-    Examples
-    ========
-
-    >>> import sympy
-    >>> f = sympy.Function("f")
-    >>> from sympy.abc import x
-    >>> f(x)
-    f(x)
-    >>> print(sympy.srepr(f(x).func))
