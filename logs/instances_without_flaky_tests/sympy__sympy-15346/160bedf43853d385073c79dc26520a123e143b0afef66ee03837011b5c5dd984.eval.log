+    This routine takes a fraction involving trigonometric or hyperbolic
+    expressions, and tries to simplify it. The primary metric is the
+    total degree. Some attempts are made to choose the simplest possible
+    expression of the minimal degree, but this is non-rigorous, and also
+    very slow (see the ``quick=True`` option).
+
+    If ``polynomial`` is set to True, instead of simplifying numerator and
+    denominator together, this function just brings numerator and denominator
+    into a canonical form. This is much faster, but has potentially worse
+    results. However, if the input is a polynomial, then the result is
+    guaranteed to be an equivalent polynomial of minimal degree.
+
+    The most important option is hints. Its entries can be any of the
+    following:
+
+    - a natural number
+    - a function
+    - an iterable of the form (func, var1, var2, ...)
+    - anything else, interpreted as a generator
+
+    A number is used to indicate that the search space should be increased.
+    A function is used to indicate that said function is likely to occur in a
+    simplified expression.
+    An iterable is used indicate that func(var1 + var2 + ...) is likely to
+    occur in a simplified .
+    An additional generator also indicates that it is likely to occur.
+    (See examples below).
+
+    This routine carries out various computationally intensive algorithms.
+    The option ``quick=True`` can be used to suppress one particularly slow
+    step (at the expense of potentially more complicated results, but never at
+    the expense of increased total degree).
+
+    Examples
+    ========
+
+    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
+    >>> from sympy import sin, tan, cos, sinh, cosh, tanh
+    >>> from sympy.simplify.trigsimp import trigsimp_groebner
+
+    Suppose you want to simplify ``sin(x)*cos(x)``. Naively, nothing happens:
+
+    >>> ex = sin(x)*cos(x)
+    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex)
+    sin(x)*cos(x)
+
+    This is because ``trigsimp_groebner`` only looks for a simplification
+    involving just ``sin(x)`` and ``cos(x)``. You can tell it to also try
+    ``2*x`` by passing ``hints=[2]``:
+
+    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[2])
+    sin(2*x)/2
+    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)**2 - cos(x)**2, hints=[2])
+    -cos(2*x)
+
+    Increasing the search space this way can quickly become expensive. A much
+    faster way is to give a specific expression that is likely to occur:
+
+    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[sin(2*x)])
+    sin(2*x)/2
+
+    Hyperbolic expressions are similarly supported:
+
+    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(2*x)/sinh(x))
+    2*cosh(x)
+
+    Note how no hints had to be passed, since the expression already involved
+    ``2*x``.
+
+    The tangent function is also supported. You can either pass ``tan`` in the
+    hints, to indicate that than should be tried whenever cosine or sine are,
+    or you can pass a specific generator:
+
+    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)/cos(x), hints=[tan])
+    tan(x)
+    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(x)/cosh(x), hints=[tanh(x)])
+    tanh(x)
+
+    Finally, you can use the iterable form to suggest that angle sum formulae
+    should be tried:
+
+    >>> ex = (tan(x) + tan(y))/(1 - tan(x)*tan(y))
+    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[(tan, x, y)])
+    tan(x + y)
