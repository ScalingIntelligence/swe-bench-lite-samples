-    Evaluation
-    ----------
-
-    If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and
-    operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the
-    ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will
-    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces
-    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any
-    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used. If
-    argument a is not a string, the mathematical expression is evaluated
-    before being passed to sympify, so adding ``evaluate=False`` will still
-    return the evaluated result of expression.
+    Parameters
+    ==========
+
+    a :
+        - any object defined in SymPy
+        - standard numeric Python types: ``int``, ``long``, ``float``, ``Decimal``
+        - strings (like ``"0.09"``, ``"2e-19"`` or ``'sin(x)'``)
+        - booleans, including ``None`` (will leave ``None`` unchanged)
+        - dicts, lists, sets or tuples containing any of the above
+
+    convert_xor : bool, optional
+        If true, treats ``^`` as exponentiation.
+        If False, treats ``^`` as XOR itself.
+        Used only when input is a string.
+
+    locals : any object defined in SymPy, optional
+        In order to have strings be recognized it can be imported
+        into a namespace dictionary and passed as locals.
+
+    strict : bool, optional
+        If the option strict is set to ``True``, only the types for which
+        an explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the
+        other cases, a SympifyError is raised.
+
+    rational : bool, optional
+        If ``True``, converts floats into :class:`~.Rational`.
+        If ``False``, it lets floats remain as it is.
+        Used only when input is a string.
+
+    evaluate : bool, optional
+        If False, then arithmetic and operators will be converted into
+        their SymPy equivalents and the ``evaluate=False`` option will be added.
+        Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will be denested first. This is done via an
+        AST transformation that replaces operators with their SymPy equivalents,
+        so if an operand redefines any of those operations, the redefined operators

+        will still return the evaluated result of expression.
+
+        .. note::
+            When ``evaluate=False``, the coordinates should be correctly interpreted
+            to ensure that imaginary coordinates are not permitted.
