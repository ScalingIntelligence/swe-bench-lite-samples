-    It will convert Python ints into instances of :class:`~.Integer`, floats

+    ------
+
+    The sympification happens with access to everything that is loaded
+    by ``from sympy import *``; anything used in a string that is not
+    defined by that import will be converted to a symbol. In the following,
+    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is
+    interpreted as the :class:`~.Order` object (used with series) and it raises
+    an error when used improperly:
+
+    >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'
+    >>> sympify(s)
+    bitcount(42)
+    >>> sympify("O(x)")
+    O(x)
+    >>> sympify("O + 1")
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    TypeError: unbound method...
+
+    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a
+    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:
+
+    >>> ns = {}
+    >>> exec('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)
+    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)
+    6
+
+    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such
+    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all
+    three of the following are possibilities:
+
+    >>> from sympy import Symbol
+    >>> ns["O"] = Symbol("O")  # method 1
+    >>> exec('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2
+    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol("O")))  # method 3
+    >>> sympify("O + 1", locals=ns)
+    O + 1
+
+    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols
+    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined
+    there as private variables: ``_clash1`` (single-letter variables),
+    ``_clash2`` (the multi-letter Greek names) or ``_clash`` (both single and
+    multi-letter names that are defined in ``abc``).
+
+    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1
+    >>> set(_clash1)
+    {'E', 'I', 'N', 'O', 'Q', 'S'}
+    >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)
+    I & Q
+
+    Strict
+    ------
+
+    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an
+    explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other
+    cases, a SympifyError is raised.
+
+    >>> print(sympify(None))
+    None
+    >>> sympify(None, strict=True)
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    SympifyError: SympifyError: None
+
+    Evaluation
+    ----------
+
+    If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and
+    operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the
+    ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul``
 
     If the argument is already a type that SymPy understands, it will do
     nothing but return that value. This can be used at the beginning of a
