The issue suggests that the error might be related to the order of assumptions in the expression and specific functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh`. The current context already includes the `Piecewise` class from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and its `_eval_subs` method, which is likely relevant as it handles substitution in Piecewise expressions. The new search results include additional code spans from different files, such as `HyperRep._eval_rewrite_as_nonrep` from `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py`, which uses `Piecewise` in its implementation. This could be relevant as it involves rewriting expressions. Other spans from `utility_function.py` involve functions like `SubstForHyperbolic`, `DeactivateTrig`, and `PiecewiseLinearQ`, which are also likely relevant due to their handling of hyperbolic and piecewise expressions. However, the immediate focus is on the `Piecewise._eval_subs` method and its handling of substitutions to possibly identify where the error might be originating. The task is complete when the relevant code spans for addressing the issue are identified, focusing on the interaction between piecewise expressions and hyperbolic functions during substitution.",
