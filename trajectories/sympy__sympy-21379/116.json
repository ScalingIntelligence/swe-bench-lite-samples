This leads to a `PolynomialError` being raised. The issue is specific to certain conditions, such as the presence of `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh` functions within the expression, and is influenced by whether symbols are assumed to be real. The search results provide several relevant code spans within the `Piecewise` class and the `Pow` class, which are likely relevant to the issue. The `Piecewise._eval_subs` method is particularly relevant as it involves the substitution logic, which directly relates to the `subs` method usage described in the issue. Additionally, the `Pow._eval_subs` method could also be relevant, as it involves the substitution logic for powers, which might be used within the expressions described in the issue. Thus, I will identify these spans as relevant to the reported issue.",

These methods are crucial for understanding how `Piecewise` expressions are handled and how substitutions are performed. Additionally, `sympy/core/power.py` provides insights into the `Pow` class, particularly the `_eval_subs` method, which is relevant for power expressions and substitutions.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
