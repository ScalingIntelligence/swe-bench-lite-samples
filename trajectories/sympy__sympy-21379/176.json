The issue seems to be sensitive to the order of assumptions and the structure of the expression. From the search results, several relevant code spans have been identified that pertain to the handling of `Piecewise` functions, `subs()` methods, and error handling. Specifically, the code spans related to `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise.eval`, `Piecewise._eval_subs`, and `exp._eval_subs` are highly relevant as they deal directly with the creation, evaluation, and substitution of `Piecewise` functions within expressions. These code spans are critical for understanding how the `Piecewise` function interacts with other parts of the expression during the `subs()` operation, which is suspected to be causing the `PolynomialError`. The `Pow._eval_subs` and `PolyElement.subs` spans are also pertinent as they handle substitutions in expressions involving powers and polynomial elements, respectively, which may be components of the problematic expression. The `Basic.subs` span, although generic, provides a broader context for how substitutions are managed across different types of expressions in SymPy, offering additional insights into potential sources of the error. Overall, these identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the relevant code handling the reported issue, suggesting a likely avenue for debugging and potential resolution.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
