Additionally, considering the specific error message ('PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense'), it would be beneficial to look into how the polynomial evaluation or substitution is managed within Sympy.",

The issue seems to be related to the handling of `Piecewise` objects within the `subs()` method. The search results provide insights into the `Piecewise` class and its `_eval_subs` method, which is likely where the problem lies. Additionally, the `Pow` and `exp` classes have `_eval_subs` methods that might be relevant as they could be involved in the substitution process for the expression in question. The analysis is focused on these specific spans of code to determine their relevance to the reported issue.\n\n1. `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` - This file contains the `Piecewise` class with its `_eval_subs` method. The method handles substitution within the `Piecewise` object, which is crucial as the error mentions 'Piecewise generators'. It is highly relevant.\n\n2. `sympy/core/power.py` - This file includes the `Pow` class with its `_eval_subs` method. This method is responsible for substituting within powers, which is relevant given the expression involves `exp(sinh(...))`. Understanding how substitutions in powers are handled can offer insights into the error.\n\n3. `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` - This file contains the `exp` class with its `_eval_subs` method. Since the expression involves exponential functions (`exp`), understanding how substitutions are managed in these functions is essential. This code span is relevant as it directly relates to the function used in the expression.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis of the provided code spans, it can be concluded that these spans are highly relevant to the reported issue, as they directly relate to the handling of substitutions within the components of the expression leading to the 'PolynomialError'.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
