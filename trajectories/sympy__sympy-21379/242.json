The error is specifically triggered when `sinh` is used inside an `exp` function with a `Piecewise` argument divided by another symbol. The error only happens when symbols `x` and `y` are assumed to be real. To diagnose this, it is necessary to look into the methods handling substitutions (`_eval_subs`), specifically those in the `Piecewise` class and the `exp` class, as well as the handling of hyperbolic functions like `sinh`. It is also important to examine the interaction of these components within the context of real-valued symbols. Potential areas to focus on include the methods handling substitutions, the `Piecewise` class, the `exp` class, and the handling of real-valued symbols in the context of hyperbolic functions.",

From the search results, several relevant code spans are identified: in `exponential.py`, the `exp` class methods `_eval_subs` and `_eval_rewrite_as_*` are found, which are related to substitution and rewriting of expressions involving `exp` (possibly related to the `exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))` part of the issue). In `piecewise.py`, the `Piecewise` class and its methods `eval`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_interval` are relevant as they deal directly with piecewise functions and their evaluation and substitution, which are central to the issue. Additionally, `power.py` contains `Pow._eval_subs`, which is generally relevant for handling power expressions, although less directly related to piecewise functions. These spans provide a good starting point to analyze and potentially fix the issue.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
