From the provided search results, it appears that key files and methods related to handling piecewise expressions and substitutions are `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`. Specifically, the `Piecewise` class and its methods `_eval_subs` and `eval` are crucial for understanding how substitutions are handled within piecewise expressions. Additionally, the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` also has a `_eval_subs` method that might influence how power expressions are substituted. Moreover, the `exp` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` is relevant because the issue mentions handling expressions with hyperbolic functions, which might be related to exponential functions or their substitutions. The analysis of these methods suggests that the potential bug might stem from how conditions are evaluated and substituted within piecewise expressions, especially when dealing with functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh`. The focus should be on ensuring that conditions evaluated within piecewise functions correctly propagate through substitution methods without leading to unexpected polynomial errors.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
