The error 'PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense' is raised under certain conditions, such as when the symbols are real and specific functions like `sinh` are involved. To debug this, it's necessary to look into methods related to substitution, piecewise functions, and hyperbolic functions in Sympy. Targeting files like `piecewise.py`, `power.py`, and `exponential.py` could be a good starting point, as they likely contain the relevant code for handling these types of expressions.",

The error is observed specifically when certain conditions are met, such as using real symbols for `x` and `y`. The search results point to relevant code in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, which is responsible for handling piecewise expressions. The `Piecewise` class and its methods like `eval` and `_eval_subs` are critical for evaluating and substituting values in such expressions. These methods handle the conditions and expressions within piecewise functions, which are directly relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` and the `exp` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` are also relevant as they involve operations that could potentially interact with piecewise expressions and lead to the observed error.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
