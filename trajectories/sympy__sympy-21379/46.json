The search results include several relevant spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and `sympy/core/function.py`. The key spans include detailed implementations of the `sinh` function such as `sinh.eval`, `sinh._eval_rewrite_as_tractable`, and `sinh._eval_rewrite_as_exp`. Additionally, spans from `sympy/core/function.py` provide context on how substitutions are handled in general, which is crucial for understanding the issue.

            "scratch_pad": "1. Analyzing the reported issue, it's clear that the user is encountering a `PolynomialError` when using the `subs()` method on particular expressions involving hyperbolic functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`, with piecewise arguments. The error is specifically triggered under certain conditions related to the structure of the expression, assumptions about the symbols, and the presence of certain functions like `Piecewise`.\n\n2. From the current file context, we already have identified code spans related to `HyperbolicFunction`, `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`. These are essential since the error is directly related to these functions.\n\n3. Reviewing the new search results, we find additional relevant code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and further extensions in `sympy/core/function.py`. Notably, the `Piecewise` class and its methods such as `_eval_subs`, `_eval_interval`, and `_eval_expand_trig` seem particularly relevant as the error description involves piecewise arguments. Additionally, the `Subs` class in `sympy/core/function.py` and its `_eval_subs` method are pertinent since `subs()` is the method causing the error.\n\n4. While the code spans related to `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` are already identified from a previous context, newer spans related to `Piecewise` and `Subs` provide a deeper understanding of the code involved in handling piecewise expressions and substitutions. These code spans should help in debugging and possibly fixing the reported issue.\n\n5. It appears that the search results are comprehensive, covering aspects like the evaluation of substitutions in piecewise expressions and handling of derivatives, which indirectly relate to the reported issue. The identified code spans sufficiently cover the core functionalities involved in the error, suggesting that the search task for identifying relevant code may be complete.",

The problem seems to be exacerbated by specific conditions and assumptions applied to the symbols. Several key points emerge from the issue: 1) The `PolynomialError` is raised specifically when using `sinh` with piecewise arguments. 2) There are conditions that mitigate or trigger the error, such as the type of function (e.g., `cosh`, `tanh`), the presence of division by `z`, and the assumptions on symbols like `x` and `y` being real. 3) The cache clearance seems to influence the error occurrence. In the search results, relevant code spans that pertain to the `subs` method and `Piecewise` function handling are identified. These include spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` about `Piecewise.eval`, `Piecewise._eval_subs`, and `Piecewise._eval_interval`. Similarly, in `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Subs._eval_subs` method is pertinent. These code sections likely encapsulate the core logic and conditions under which the issue occurs, providing a foundation for further diagnosis and resolution.",

No direct interactions between `Piecewise` and these hyperbolic functions were found in the methods provided, such as `_eval_subs`. Additionally, the `Subs` class from 'sympy/core/function.py' also has an `_eval_subs` method, which indicates how substitutions are handled in expressions involving symbolic substitutions. The analysis of 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' does not explicitly mention `Piecewise` interactions, but it does define methods relevant to hyperbolic functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`, including their evaluation and rewriting methods.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
