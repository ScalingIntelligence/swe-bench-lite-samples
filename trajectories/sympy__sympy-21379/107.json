The specific error, `PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense`, arises under certain conditions. To debug this, we should focus on the `Piecewise` class and its interactions with `subs`, as well as the handling of hyperbolic functions in `sympy`. Additionally, the caching mechanism might be a factor, so we should also look into how caching affects these operations.",

The specific conditions under which the error arises include using `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh` within a `Piecewise` function, particularly when the argument involves real symbols.\n\nStep 2: Reviewing current context.\nNo relevant code has been identified yet.\n\nStep 3: Processing new search results.\n3.1 Analyzing code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`.\nThe `Piecewise` class and its methods, such as `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_interval`, and `_eval_subs`, handle the evaluation and substitution of piecewise functions. These methods could be relevant to the issue since the error occurs with `Piecewise` arguments.\n\n3.2 Analyzing code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`.\nThe `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` classes and their methods, such as `eval`, handle the evaluation of hyperbolic functions. These methods could be relevant since the error involves these functions.\n\n3.3 Analyzing code spans in `sympy/core/cache.py`.\nThe `clear_cache` method in the `_cache` class is related to clearing the cache, which is mentioned in the issue but is unlikely directly related to the `PolynomialError`.\n\n3.4 Matching code spans with the reported issue.\nThe relevant code spans include those handling the `Piecewise` class and the evaluation of hyperbolic functions (`sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`). These spans are likely to contain the logic that handles the expressions causing the `PolynomialError`.\n\n3.5 Verifying relevance.\nThe `Piecewise` class and its methods are directly related to the `Piecewise` argument in the expressions causing the error. The `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` methods are directly related to the hyperbolic functions in the expressions.

The focus is on understanding the interactions between `Piecewise` and hyperbolic functions (`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`) within the SymPy library. The provided search results include relevant code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, which are key to diagnosing the issue. The `Piecewise` class handles expressions with conditional logic, and its methods such as `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_interval`, and `_eval_subs` are critical for this issue. The hyperbolic functions' `eval` methods, particularly for `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`, are also analyzed since they are central to the expressions causing the error. The cache-related functions from `sympy/core/cache.py` might also indirectly influence the behavior, but their role is secondary. The analysis concentrates on identifying the exact code spans dealing with the evaluation and substitution logic within these classes to pinpoint why the `PolynomialError` occurs for specific expressions involving piecewise and hyperbolic functions.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
