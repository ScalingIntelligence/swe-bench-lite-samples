This seems to be related to SymPy's handling of such expressions, possibly in the `Piecewise` class or related to how the `subs()` method evaluates these expressions under certain conditions like the assumptions on the symbols. To pinpoint the issue, we should start by searching for the `Piecewise` class and its methods, especially those related to substitution (`subs`) and evaluation. Additionally, we should look into the `subs()` method within the `sympy.core.power` module since the expression involves exponentiation.",

The issue seems to be related to the handling of piecewise functions and their interactions with other functions like `exp`. The provided search results contain relevant code spans from `Piecewise` and `Pow` classes in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`, respectively. The `Piecewise._eval_subs` method is particularly relevant as it deals with substitution in piecewise functions, which is central to the reported issue. Additionally, the `Pow._eval_subs` method is relevant as it handles substitution for power expressions, which might be involved when dealing with expressions like `exp(sinh(...))`. These spans provide the necessary context to understand how `subs()` is implemented for these expressions and might help in identifying where the issue arises.",
