The `PolynomialError` arises under specific conditions, such as when using `sinh` with `Piecewise` arguments and real symbols. Potential areas to investigate include the `Piecewise` class methods, particularly `_eval_subs`, and related functions like `SubstForHyperbolic` and `FunctionOfHyperbolic` in `utility_function.py`. Also, the `_eval_subs` method in the `Pow` class and `exp` class could be relevant due to the involvement of exponential functions.",

The analysis of the search results reveals several relevant code spans that deal with the `subs()` method and the handling of hyperbolic functions within the Piecewise class and other related classes. Specifically, the spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/core/power.py` are particularly relevant as they contain methods for evaluating substitutions and handling piecewise expressions and powers. The spans from `sympy/integrals/rubi/utility_function.py` also deal with hyperbolic functions but primarily for integration purposes and not directly related to the reported issue. Based on the analysis, the most relevant code spans are those that deal with the `subs()` method and piecewise expressions within the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, and the `subs()` method in the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py`.
