The error 'PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense' arises under specific conditions, such as when symbols are assumed real and certain functions like `exp` and `sinh` are used. To investigate this, I should look into the implementation of the `subs` method in classes like `Piecewise` and `exp`, and potentially other related functions such as `sinh` and `cosh`. Additionally, examining any utility functions or helper methods associated with these classes might provide more context on how substitutions are handled.",

The issue is traced to the order of assumptions and the structure of the expression. After analyzing the search results, several key code spans have been identified in the `sympy` codebase that are relevant to this issue. These include the `subs` method in `Basic` class, the `_eval_subs` method in `Subs` class, and the `_eval_subs` method in `Piecewise` class. Each of these methods deals with substitution and evaluation of expressions, which are central to the reported issue. By examining these code spans, it is possible to understand the internal mechanics of how substitutions are handled in different contexts, including the handling of piecewise expressions. This analysis will help in diagnosing the exact cause of the `PolynomialError` and potentially suggest fixes or improvements.",

The method handles the substitution process by iterating over a sequence of old and new pairs and applying them to the current expression. The `Subs` and `Piecewise` classes have their own implementations of `subs`, tailored to their specific use cases. Notably, the `Piecewise` class ensures that the substitution respects the logical conditions associated with each piece. In the context of the hyperbolic functions `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`, their evaluation logic includes special handling for certain types of inputs such as complex numbers or specific mathematical functions. These functions also have methods to determine their properties based on the input's assumptions, such as whether the input is real or extended real. Given the nature of the error, which appears to be triggered by specific assumptions and functions interacting within a piecewise expression, a deeper examination of these interactions is necessary to identify the root cause.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
