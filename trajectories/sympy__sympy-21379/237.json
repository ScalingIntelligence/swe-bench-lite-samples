The error is triggered under certain conditions, such as when using real symbols for `x` and `y`. To pinpoint the root cause, it's essential to focus on parts of the code that handle substitutions, particularly in expressions involving Piecewise and hyperbolic functions, as well as their interactions. Specifically, the error message 'Piecewise generators do not make sense' suggests a problem in handling piecewise functions during substitution. Additionally, since clearing the cache affects the behavior, understanding how caching impacts these operations is crucial.",

Key details include the behavior of the error in specific circumstances, such as with different functions (cosh, tanh) and conditions (real symbols, divisions). The search results include several files and spans of code related to the `subs()` method, which is central to the issue. Among these, 'sympy/core/basic.py' has extensive code related to the `subs()` method and its evaluation. This file also includes the `Basic` class definition and its `subs` method, which seems directly relevant to the issue at hand. The other files contain various implementations and uses of `subs()`, such as in 'sympy/functions/elementary/benchmarks/bench_exp.py' and 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py'. Given the specific context of the issue (involving `sinh`, `exp`, and `Piecewise`), the 'Basic.subs' and 'Basic._subs' methods in 'sympy/core/basic.py' are particularly relevant as they handle the substitution logic. Other spans in different files either do not directly relate to the specific issue or are less directly related. Therefore, the focus should be on the 'Basic.subs' method in 'sympy/core/basic.py'.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
