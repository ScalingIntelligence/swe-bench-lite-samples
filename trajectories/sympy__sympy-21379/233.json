The error is sensitive to the order of assumptions and specific functions used. The error seems to be connected to how `Piecewise` and hyperbolic functions are handled in the `subs()` method. To pinpoint the issue, we should focus on the `Piecewise` class and its interaction with hyperbolic functions in the `subs()` method. Additionally, examining related utility functions for substitutions in hyperbolic expressions might provide further insights. Given the specific conditions mentioned in the issue, we should search for code related to `subs()` in `Piecewise` and `exp`, `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` functions.",

The issue is specifically triggered when these expressions are real-valued. The analysis of the code spans provided in the search results reveals several key areas that might be relevant to the issue: \n\n1. **Piecewise Function Handling**: The `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` contains methods for evaluating, substituting, and performing operations on piecewise functions. The `_eval_subs` method is particularly relevant as it handles substitutions in piecewise expressions. This method could be the source of the error when substituting real-valued expressions.\n\n2. **Hyperbolic Functions**: The `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` classes in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` define the behavior of these hyperbolic functions. The `eval` methods for these classes handle the evaluation of these functions for different types of arguments, including real numbers. The behavior when these functions are combined with piecewise arguments could be crucial in determining the source of the error.\n\n3. **Exponential Function**: The `exp` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` is used to handle exponential expressions, which are commonly involved when dealing with hyperbolic functions. The `_eval_subs` method in this class also handles substitutions, similar to the `Piecewise` class. Understanding how substitutions are handled here could shed light on the error.\n\nGiven these observations, the relevant code spans are those that handle substitutions in piecewise and exponential functions, as well as the evaluation of hyperbolic functions with real-valued arguments. These spans are likely to contain the logic that triggers the `PolynomialError` when real symbols are involved in the expressions.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
