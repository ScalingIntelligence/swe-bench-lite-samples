The error is specific to real symbols for `x` and `y` and seems to involve the order of assumptions or the handling of piecewise functions. To address this, we should focus on methods and classes related to substitutions (`subs()`), piecewise functions, and hyperbolic functions in the Sympy library. Search targets include classes like `Piecewise`, `Pow`, and `exp_polar`, and methods like `_eval_subs()` and `eval()`. We should also check for any special handling or assumptions regarding real symbols and their interactions with these functions.",

The problem seems to be specific to certain configurations, especially when `x` and `y` are real symbols and `z` is not necessarily real. The error occurs under certain conditions, such as when using `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, or when dividing by `z`. The `PolynomialError` message mentions 'Piecewise generators do not make sense', which suggests that the issue is related to the handling of Piecewise expressions. The code spans identified in the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file are particularly relevant because they contain methods like `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise.eval`, and `Piecewise._eval_subs`, which are directly involved in the creation, evaluation, and substitution of Piecewise expressions. Additionally, the `exp._eval_subs` method in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` might also be relevant as it handles the substitution for exponential expressions, which could interact with the Piecewise components. The analysis takes into account all sections of the code to ensure a thorough understanding of how Piecewise and exponential expressions are processed during substitution.",

To further investigate this, it would be beneficial to: 1) Look into the `_eval_subs` method in both `Piecewise` and `exp` classes to understand how substitutions are processed in the presence of piecewise and exponential functions. 2) Examine how real assumptions influence the behavior of substitution operations, particularly within the framework of hyperbolic functions. 3) Investigate error handling mechanisms within Sympy to see if there are specific conditions under which `PolynomialError` is raised. 4) Explore related modules in Sympy that manage assumptions and their impact on these operations.

The current file context and search results focus on these elements, particularly in the files `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`. From the search results, it's evident that these files contain relevant code spans such as `Piecewise._eval_subs`, `exp._eval_subs`, and methods related to `Piecewise` and `exp` handling `subs`. These methods are crucial for understanding how substitutions are handled in expressions. The additional search results, though extensive, further confirm the focus on `Piecewise`, `exp`, and related functions, reinforcing the initial identified relevant code spans.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
