The error specifically occurs with certain configurations of symbols and functions, leading to a `PolynomialError`. The search results contain the relevant implementation of the `Piecewise` class and its methods, which are likely involved in handling the piecewise components of the expression. The `eval` method of `Piecewise` appears particularly relevant as it processes the conditions and expressions, potentially leading to the error described. Additionally, the `doit` method is highlighted as it performs operations on the piecewise expressions, which could also be a source of the issue.

The error arises under specific conditions, such as using `cosh` or `tanh` instead of `sinh`, removing division by `z`, or removing `exp`. The analysis suggests the issue might be related to the order of assumptions or the handling of piecewise functions within Sympy. The provided file context and search results focus on the `Piecewise` class in Sympy, which is directly related to the piecewise arguments in the expressions triggering the error. The code spans provided in the search results involve the `eval` and `doit` methods of the `Piecewise` class, which are crucial for evaluating and processing piecewise expressions. These methods handle the simplification and evaluation of piecewise expressions, making them relevant to understanding and resolving the reported issue. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly pertain to the handling and evaluation of piecewise expressions in Sympy.",

These methods handle the evaluation and simplification of piecewise expressions, which is crucial for understanding why the `PolynomialError` might be occurring. Additionally, the `Expr` class and its methods, such as `compute_leading_term` and `_eval_interval`, are relevant as they involve the computation and evaluation of expressions that could contain piecewise components. The search results provide a comprehensive view of how piecewise expressions are handled and evaluated, which is essential for debugging the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
