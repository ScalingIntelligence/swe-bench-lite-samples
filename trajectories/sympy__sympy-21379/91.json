The error occurs specifically when these expressions are substituted, leading to a `PolynomialError`. The issue seems to be influenced by the order of assumptions and specific types of functions used within the expressions. The analysis involves segments of code related to the `Pow`, `exp`, `exp_polar`, and `Piecewise` classes, as well as their respective `_eval_subs` methods. These segments are likely relevant because they handle the substitution of expressions and might interact with the conditions leading to the reported error. Also, considering the focus on hyperbolic functions, segments related to `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` from the trigonometric module might also be relevant, as these are involved in the expressions causing the issue. The identified segments are: `Pow._eval_subs`, `exp._eval_subs`, `exp_polar._eval_subs`, `Piecewise._eval_subs`, and methods related to the rewrite of functions as hyperbolic functions.",

            "scratch_pad": "Upon reviewing the reported issue, it is clear that the problem lies in the behavior of the `subs()` method when dealing with expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids and piecewise arguments. The reported issue highlights specific conditions under which the `PolynomialError` is thrown, particularly when dealing with expressions like `exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))`. The issue involves the interaction between `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `sinh` functions during substitution.\n\nFrom the current file context, we have already identified relevant code spans in `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` that deal with the `subs()` method for `Pow`, `exp`, and `Piecewise` respectively. These spans are crucial as they handle the substitution logic, which is central to the reported issue.\n\nIn the new search results, we find additional relevant code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and further details in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. Specifically, the `sinh` and `cosh` classes in `hyperbolic.py` and the `Piecewise` class in `piecewise.py` are of interest. These spans provide more details on how `sinh`, `cosh`, and `Piecewise` handle evaluation and substitution, which could be key to understanding and resolving the issue.\n\nThe `sinh` class's `eval` method and `Piecewise` class's `__new__` and `_eval_subs` methods are particularly relevant. These methods deal with the evaluation of `sinh` functions and substitution within piecewise expressions, respectively. The presence of these methods in the search results suggests that the codebase already has mechanisms in place to handle such complex expressions, but there might be a specific case or condition that is not adequately addressed, leading to the `PolynomialError`.\n\nGiven the depth and specificity of the reported issue, it is likely that more detailed inspection and potential debugging will be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause and implement a solution. However, the identified code spans provide a solid foundation for further investigation and can be a starting point for developers attempting to resolve the issue.\n\nOverall, the search results have enriched our understanding of how substitution is handled in expressions involving hyperbolic functions and piecewise arguments. The identified code spans are relevant and useful for addressing the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "1. Analyze the reported issue: The issue involves the `subs()` method for expressions containing hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. Specifically, a `PolynomialError` is raised unexpectedly when certain substitutions are made. Key elements to look for in the code are the handling of `Piecewise` expressions and substitutions in them, as well as any interaction with hyperbolic functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`.\n\n2. Review current context: The file context provided includes multiple files like `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. These files contain code spans related to power operations, exponential functions, and piecewise functions, respectively. Relevant methods like `_eval_subs` are present in these files, indicating potential locations for the issue.\n\n3. Process new search results:\n   a. In `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, there are code spans related to `Piecewise` functions, including methods like `__new__`, `_eval_subs`, and others. These methods handle the creation, substitution, and evaluation of piecewise functions, which are central to the reported issue due to the presence of piecewise arguments in the expressions.\n   b. In `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, there are code spans for `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` classes, along with methods like `eval` and others. These methods are responsible for evaluating hyperbolic functions and could interact with piecewise arguments, making these spans relevant.\n   c. The `_eval_subs` method in both `Piecewise` and hyperbolic function classes is particularly relevant as it deals with substitution, which is a core part of the issue reported.\n\n4. Conclusion: From the analysis, it is clear that the code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` are highly relevant to the reported issue. These spans include critical methods for handling substitutions within piecewise and hyperbolic functions. Therefore, they should be identified as relevant for further investigation or potential fixes related to the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
