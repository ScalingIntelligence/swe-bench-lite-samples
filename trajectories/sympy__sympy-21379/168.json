The error surface is exacerbated by using subs() on complex mathematical expressions with piece-wise conditions. I will focus my search on files and functions that deal with Piecewise objects, hyperbolic functions with substitutions, and potentially the power class which involves evaluations and sub-class conversions. Given the behavior described, it is also possible that the error could be related to how the symbolic caching is managed in the code.",

The analysis of the search results reveals that the `Piecewise` class and its methods, such as `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_interval`, are relevant as they handle the evaluation and substitution of piecewise expressions. Additionally, the `exp` class and its methods are relevant because the issue involves expressions wrapped with `exp` and trigonometric functions. The cache-related code in `sympy/core/cache.py` might also be relevant as clearing the cache affects the behavior of the expressions.",

The error is particularly triggered when using expressions like `exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))`. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals several key points: \n\n1. There are multiple occurrences of `Piecewise` class and its methods like `_eval_subs`, `doit`, and `_eval_interval` which could be relevant as they handle the evaluation and substitution logic for piecewise functions.\n2. The `exp` class and its `eval` and `_eval_subs` methods are also present. These handle the exponential function, which is crucial in the reported expression.\n3. There are other supporting classes and methods such as `Pow`, `Mul`, `Function`, `Derivative`, and `Subs` which although indirectly, play a role in the evaluation and substitution process.\n\nGiven the reported issue, it seems relevant to focus on the `Piecewise` class and its methods due to their direct handling of piecewise functions, which are central to the expressions causing the error. Additionally, the methods in the `exp` class are also relevant as they directly deal with the exponential function part of the problematic expression.",

The issue seems to be closely related to the behavior of `Piecewise` and `exp` functions within the SymPy library. Given the context provided, it is evident that the problem arises due to the interaction between these functions and the specific assumptions or conditions applied during substitution. Therefore, the relevant code spans should focus on the implementation and evaluation of these functions, particularly their `_eval_subs` and `eval` methods to better understand how substitutions are handled and potentially where the error originates. Additionally, the provided context already indicates some relevant files such as `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` with specific spans of code which are likely to contain the necessary details to diagnose and potentially fix the reported issue. Given the current context and the detailed symptoms described in the issue, these code spans should be sufficient to investigate and understand the root cause. Further analysis could involve checking for specific conditions under which the `subs()` method fails and how assumptions about symbol properties interact with the evaluation of piecewise and exponential functions.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
