Key aspects to consider are the evaluation of `subs()` for expressions containing `exp`, `sinh`, `Piecewise`, and specific assumptions about symbol types. The provided search results include relevant files and code spans that address such functions and operations. For instance, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` contains the `exp` class with its `_eval_subs` method, which is likely involved in the substitution process. Similarly, `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` contains the `Piecewise` class with its `_eval_subs` method, which is crucial for handling substitutions within piecewise defined functions. These code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue due to their involvement in the substitution process for expressions involving `exp`, `sinh`, and `Piecewise` functionalities.

Key clues from the issue include: the error occurs with `cosh` or `tanh` but not `sinh`, the presence of `exp` and `Piecewise` functions, and the use of real symbols for `x` and `y`. The initial context provided files from `sympy/functions/elementary/` that included methods for `exp` and `Piecewise` which may contribute to the error. The new search results expand on these with additional methods like `Piecewise.__new__` and `Piecewise._intervals` from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, which are likely relevant due to their direct handling of piecewise functions. Furthermore, the file `sympy/polys/polyerrors.py` contains error classes including `PolynomialError`, which is directly related to the issue. The presence of `OperationNotSupported`, `NotAlgebraic`, and `DomainError` within `polyerrors.py` suggests these could be contributing factors or related errors that might help in understanding the issue deeper. The `_eval_subs` method within `Piecewise` is likely a critical point of interest as it directly involves substitution operations, which could be the source of the error. Thus, these code spans are relevant to the investigation and possibly the solution of the reported issue.",

The user has reported a `PolynomialError` with the message 'Piecewise generators do not make sense' when performing `subs` on such expressions. The issue seems to be tied to the assumptions and the structure of the expression, particularly concerning the `Piecewise` component. The search results for `Piecewise` and `exp` confirm that these are the key areas to focus on. Specifically, the `_eval_subs` method in the `Piecewise` class seems to be where the error arises. To address this, it would be beneficial to further investigate the handling of conditions and substitutions in this method to ensure that it correctly processes expressions with `Piecewise` and other complex components. Additionally, understanding how the `exp` class interacts with these substitutions might also be necessary. Based on the user's feedback, it's also important to note that changes to the symbols' assumptions and the structure of the expression (such as removing the division by `z` or the `exp` function) affect the error's occurrence. This suggests that the assumptions about the symbols and the type of operation within the expression might be contributing factors to the error. Therefore, the `_eval_subs` method and potentially other related evaluation methods in `Piecewise` and `exp` are areas to investigate for potential improvements or bug fixes.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
