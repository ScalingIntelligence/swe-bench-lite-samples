The error is dependent on the order of assumptions and the presence of specific functions like `sinh`. It's crucial to search for functions related to substitution, piecewise functions, and hyperbolic functions. Potential files to check include those handling substitution (`_eval_subs`), piecewise expressions (`Piecewise`), and hyperbolic functions (`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`). The search should focus on understanding how these elements interact within the expression evaluation process.",

The error seems to be triggered specifically when certain conditions are met (e.g., real symbols, presence of `exp`, division by `z`, etc.). To identify relevant code spans, I focused on the `Piecewise` class and its methods from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` as it is central to the issue. I also looked at the `exp` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` since the error arises with `exp` in the expression. Additionally, I reviewed the `sinh` and `cosh` classes in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` to understand their interaction with the expressions mentioned in the issue. The `_eval_subs` method in `Piecewise` is particularly relevant as it handles substitution, which is the operation causing the error. The `eval` methods in `exp` and `sinh` are also relevant as they evaluate expressions that could contribute to the error condition.",

Further investigation into how `subs` affects nested expressions involving `exp` and `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh` when they are within `Piecewise` structures is crucial.

It might be helpful to explore more deeply the assumptions related to real symbols and the effect of specific functions like division or exponential on the behavior of `subs`.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves unexpected behavior with the `subs` method for expressions containing hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments, leading to a `PolynomialError`. The analysis focuses on identifying the relevant code spans in the `Piecewise` and `exp` classes, particularly methods like `_eval_subs` and `eval` that handle substitution and evaluation of expressions. Given the context and the search results: \n\n1. `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`: Contains critical methods for handling piecewise expressions, including `_eval_subs` used for substitution. The method `_eval_subs` is particularly relevant as it processes substitutions within piecewise expressions. \n\n2. `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`: The `exp` class and its method `_eval_subs` are examined for how they handle substitutions involving exponential functions, which are central to the reported expression.\n\n3. The analysis ensures that crucial parts of the code, such as condition handling and expression evaluation within the `Piecewise` class and `exp` class, are correctly identified. This involves checking how conditions are managed, substitutions are applied, and expressions are evaluated, especially concerning piecewise and exponential components.\n\nHowever, despite extensive analysis, it seems that the issue's root cause might be deeper or related to assumptions or order of operations within SymPy's handling of these complex expressions. The existing code spans examined handle standard scenarios well, suggesting that the issue might be triggered by specific, intricate combinations of elements not directly addressed by the current search results. Further investigation or additional tests might be needed to pinpoint the exact cause of the `PolynomialError` in the specified conditions. The provided spans are relevant to the operations described, but the specific error might require more detailed condition checks or assumption handling, which are not fully covered in the currently identified spans.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
