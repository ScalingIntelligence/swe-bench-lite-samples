The error is particularly seen in the `_eval_subs` method of the `Piecewise` class. To pinpoint the exact cause and potential fixes or workarounds, we need to investigate the `_eval_subs` method in `Piecewise`, as well as the handling of hyperbolic functions within `sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic` and `sympy.core.power`.

The relevant code spans identified in the search results include the implementation of the `Piecewise` class and its `_eval_subs` method, which is critical for substitution operations. Additionally, the code spans for hyperbolic functions like `cosh` and `tanh` are identified as they are mentioned in the issue description as particular cases where the error occurs. These spans are relevant as they directly relate to the functions and operations mentioned in the reported issue. The `_eval_power` and `_eval_nseries` methods within the `Piecewise` class are also relevant as they hint at how the piecewise functions interact with other mathematical operations which could be potential sources of the error mentioned.

For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
