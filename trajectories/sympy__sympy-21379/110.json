The search should focus on these specific functions and their methods, particularly '_eval_subs', which is responsible for substitution logic. Additionally, the issue might be related to how 'Piecewise' handles generators and assumptions. Therefore, the search should concentrate on the 'Piecewise' class and its methods, as well as any related utility functions like '_eval_rewrite_as_ITE' or 'piecewise_fold', which might impact how expressions are handled.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
