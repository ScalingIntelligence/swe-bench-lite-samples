            "scratch_pad": "Identified relevant code spans in the search results that seem to align with the reported issue regarding unexpected `PolynomialError` when using `subs()` for certain hyperbolic expressions with piecewise arguments. The issue seems to be related to the handling of `Piecewise` functions within hyperbolic and exponential functions, particularly with the `sinh`, `cosh`, and `exp` functions. The analysis of the relevant spans from `Piecewise` and `exp` classes in the search results suggests that the issue might be arising due to improper handling of substitutions or evaluation of these functions. For instance, the `_eval_subs` methods in `Piecewise` and `exp` classes seem particularly relevant as they deal with substitution operations that are likely involved in the reported issue. Additionally, the `eval` methods for `sinh`, `cosh`, and `exp` could also be potential points of interest as they handle the evaluation of these functions which might interact poorly with the piecewise components leading to the polynomial error. Furthermore, the conditions described in the issue regarding real symbols and specific functions like cosh, tanh, and their absence causing the error suggest that the assumptions or conditions under which these functions are evaluated or substituted might be critical. This is reinforced by the observation of how the error goes away or persists under specific conditions like symbols being real or not, or removing certain functions or divisions. Overall, the search results provide ample context to hypothesize where in the codebase the issue could be located and what adjustments might be needed to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
