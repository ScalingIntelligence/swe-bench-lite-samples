The primary clues are the conditions under which the `PolynomialError` occurs, primarily when using `sinh` with a piecewise function and when certain assumptions are made about the symbols. The search results primarily focus on the `Piecewise` and `exp` (exponential) functions within Sympy, which are central to the expression in question. The `Piecewise` class's `_eval_subs` method is examined for how it handles substitutions, and similarly, the `exp` class's `_eval_subs` method is reviewed for its treatment of substitutions, particularly given the presence of exponential functions in the expression. The focus in these methods is on how they handle the substitution of values and how they might interact with other parts of the expression, such as the piecewise function, to potentially cause the error. By examining these methods, we can understand the potential points of failure or unexpected behavior when applying substitutions to complex expressions involving piecewise functions and exponential functions, which aligns with the reported issue. Additionally, these methods reveal how Sympy handles substitutions for different types of functions and how it might be causing the specific error mentioned in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
