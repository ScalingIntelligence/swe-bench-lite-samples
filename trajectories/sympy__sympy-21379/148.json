The issue specifically arises when substituting integers with floats, potentially due to type mismatches or assumptions about the symbols. The issue seems to be exacerbated by the use of `Piecewise` functions and certain symbolic assumptions about the variables.\n\nGiven this context, the search for relevant code spans should focus on methods and functionalities within the `Piecewise` class, particularly where substitutions and symbolic manipulations are handled. The `Piecewise._eval_subs` method is of particular interest, as it directly handles substitutions for `Piecewise` expressions. Additionally, methods like `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise.eval`, and `Piecewise._intervals` should also be considered as they play crucial roles in the construction and evaluation of piecewise functions.\n\nThe current file context provided already highlights the `Piecewise._eval_subs` method, which is directly relevant to the issue. This method contains logic for substituting values into `Piecewise` expressions, which aligns well with the reported issue. Furthermore, there are additional methods like `Piecewise.__new__` and `Piecewise.eval` that manage the creation and initial evaluation of `Piecewise` objects, which could also influence how substitutions behave.\n\nConsidering this analysis, the next steps should involve reviewing the new search results to identify any additional relevant code spans or clarify whether existing spans are sufficient to address the issue.",
