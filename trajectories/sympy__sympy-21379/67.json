The provided search results include implementations of these functions and their methods, particularly in the `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and `sympy/core/power.py` files. Relevant spans include those where these functions are defined and where their evaluation methods are implemented, focusing on `_eval_subs`, `_eval_rewrite_as_tractable`, and other related methods. Additionally, the error conditions mentioned in the issue suggest that the assumptions about the order of expressions, particularly with real symbols, may be pertinent. The code spans that check for real symbols and evaluate the conditions for `sinh`, `cosh`, etc., should be considered relevant. The issue also mentions debugging difficulties, indicating that the identified code spans should help in understanding the behavior and potential issues around substitutions and type casting in the expressions.",

We already have identified relevant code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`. The new search results in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` contain the `Piecewise` class, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of piecewise functions in the context of the issue. This class includes methods for evaluation (`eval`), substitution (`_eval_subs`), and interval evaluation (`_eval_interval`), which could be critical for understanding how the `subs()` method interacts with piecewise expressions. The `Piecewise` class also includes methods for handling the evaluation of piecewise functions in intervals, which could be relevant for understanding the error conditions related to the `PolynomialError`. The `Piecewise.eval` method includes logic for collapsing nested piecewise expressions and handling conditions, which could be a source of the issue. Additionally, the `_eval_subs` method in `Piecewise` could be where the substitution logic interacts with the piecewise conditions, possibly leading to the error. The `_eval_interval` method also includes logic for evaluating piecewise expressions across intervals, which could be relevant for understanding how the piecewise expressions are handled and potentially leading to the error.",

            "scratch_pad": "The analysis of the reported issue reveals that it involves unexpected behavior with the `subs` method for particular expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids and piecewise arguments, leading to a `PolynomialError`. The file `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` contains the `Piecewise` class implementation, including the `_eval_subs` method that is crucial for understanding how substitutions are handled for piecewise expressions. Additionally, other files, such as `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/core/basic.py`, contain general expression handling and substitution rules that may apply to complex expressions. The file context provided includes methods and classes that are likely relevant to understanding the issue, such as the `sinh` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, which contains methods for evaluating rewrite as tractable and as cosh, among other things. The `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` also has a `_eval_subs` method and logic for handling substitutions, which could be related to the issue. Furthermore, the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` includes the `_eval_subs` method that is explicitly related to handling substitutions for piecewise expressions. These elements suggest that the provided file context is closely related to the reported issue and should be sufficient for addressing it.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
