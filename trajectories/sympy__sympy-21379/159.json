The error seems to be tied to specific conditions, such as the use of real symbols and particular functions like `sinh`. Focus should be on the `Piecewise` class and its interaction with functions like `exp` and `sinh`, particularly in the context of substitution. The error might be related to how these functions handle the `Piecewise` conditions during substitution. Searching for code related to the `Piecewise` class in the context of substitution and handling of hyperbolic functions might help uncover the root cause.",

The analysis reveals that the error occurs under specific conditions related to the assumptions of the symbols involved and the structure of the expression. The search results provide relevant code spans that handle operations related to piecewise functions and substitutions. In the provided code, the `Piecewise` class and its methods handle the evaluation, substitution, and interval operations for expressions involving piecewise conditions. This is directly relevant to the issue as it involves expressions with piecewise arguments that fail when certain substitutions are made. Furthermore, the `exp` class and its `_eval_subs` method are relevant as they handle substitution operations for exponential functions, which are also part of the expression involved in the issue.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
