The error is sensitive to the order of assumptions and specific functions used, namely that replacing `sinh` with `cosh` or `tanh` leads to the error. The error is also influenced by the presence of division and the `exp` function. Given the complexity of the issue, it appears the fault lies within how SymPy handles substitutions within piecewise functions containing hyperbolic sinusoids and other specified conditions. The search results provide insight into how SymPy handles Piecewise functions and substitutions. The `Piecewise._eval_subs` method appears particularly relevant as it is responsible for handling substitutions within Piecewise expressions. This method iterates through the arguments of a Piecewise function, applying substitutions to the expressions and conditions. Based on the reported issue, the error likely arises during the execution of this method. Thus, further investigation into this method will be crucial to diagnose and resolve the reported issue.",

From the provided context and search results, it is clear that the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is relevant. The `Piecewise._eval_subs` method is of particular interest as it directly deals with substitution in `Piecewise` expressions. The search results show several other methods within the `Piecewise` class, but `Piecewise._eval_subs` is the most pertinent due to its direct relation to the `subs()` operation. Additionally, the search results from other files like `sympy/core/cache.py`, `sympy/core/function.py`, and `sympy/core/basic.py` do not directly address the issue at hand.

These methods are likely involved in the error's origin or its resolution. Additionally, the `piecewise_fold` and `piecewise_simplify` functions are relevant for simplifying and folding piecewise expressions, which could affect how the `subs()` method behaves.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
