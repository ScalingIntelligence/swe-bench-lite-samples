            "scratch_pad": "1. Analyzing the reported issue, it seems the problem arises specifically when using `subs()` on expressions involving hyperbolic functions with piecewise arguments.\n2. The issue highlights the error 'PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense' which occurs under specific conditions with `sin`, `cosh`, or `tanh` functions, real symbols, and division by `z`.\n3. The error goes away if certain elements are removed (like division by `z`) or if `exp` is removed though it stayed for most unary functions like `sin` or `log`.\n4. From the search results, the most pertinent code spans seem to be related to the `HyperbolicFunction` class in `hyperbolic.py` and the `Piecewise` class in `piecewise.py`, specifically focusing on methods like `__new__`, `eval`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_interval` which deal with evaluation, substitution, and interval operations.\n5. These methods could have crucial interactions with hyperbolic functions and piecewise expressions, central to the issue at hand.\n6. The provided code for `Piecewise._eval_subs` directly pertains to substitution methods which are key to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.\n7. Furthermore, the `_eval_interval` method within `Piecewise` also seems relevant as it might interact with the errors occurring during these operations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the provided search results do indeed contain key elements directly relevant to the issue reported.",

The error occurs under specific conditions, such as when `cosh` or `tanh` are used in place of `sinh`, or when real symbols are used for `x` and `y` but not for `z`. It was noted that the error does not occur if the division by `z` is removed or if `exp` (but not other unary functions like `sin`, `log`, etc.) is removed. Analysis of the provided file context and search results reveals several key areas of relevance:\n\n1. `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` contains definitions for hyperbolic functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`. The `sinh` class's `fdiff` and `_eval_expand_trig` methods, as well as the `cosh` class's `fdiff` and `_eval_expand_trig` methods, are particularly relevant as they handle differentiation and trigonometric expansion, which may be related to the error.\n\n2. `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` includes the `Piecewise` class, which is central to the issue because the error arises when piecewise arguments are used. The `Piecewise._eval_subs` method is directly relevant as it handles substitution, which is the operation being performed when the error occurs. Additionally, the `Piecewise._eval_rewrite_as_KroneckerDelta` method is relevant for rewrites, which may provide insights into how the error is managed or triggered under specific conditions.\n\n3. `sympy/core/basic.py` contains the `Basic.rewrite` method, which involves rewrites that could potentially affect how the expression is handled under the operations being performed when the error occurs.\n\nGiven these points, the relevant code spans appear to be those identified within the hyperbolic.py and piecewise.py files, particularly where they handle differentiation, expansion, substitution, and rewrites. Thus, the identified spans are useful for understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
