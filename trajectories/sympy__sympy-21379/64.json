Key characteristics of the issue include: the error primarily occurs with `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh`; the error is influenced by the order of assumptions and the structure of the expression; and the error is sensitive to the presence of specific functions like `exp` and the division by `z`. To accurately locate the relevant code, focus on functions and classes within the SymPy library that deal with substitutions, piecewise functions, and hyperbolic functions, particularly those that are part of the expression evaluation and simplification processes.",

The issue seems to be sensitive to specific conditions including the hyperbolic function used, the presence of division, and the type of symbols involved. Given these conditions, the search results should focus on the implementation of the `sinh()` function and its interactions with other functions like `cosh()` and `tanh()`. The search results provided include the implementation of the `sinh()` function, its evaluation methods, and rewrites in terms of other functions. These sections are crucial for understanding how the `sinh()` function handles different types of arguments, and they potentially provide clues about the error's origin. Additionally, the results include the implementations of `cosh()` and `tanh()`, which might also contribute to the issue due to the noted sensitivity to different hyperbolic functions.",

The `Piecewise` class is of particular interest as it involves handling conditional expressions, which are central to the reported problem. The `Basic.subs` method is also crucial as it is directly responsible for substitution operations. The new search results provide more context on how `Piecewise` and `Basic` classes handle evaluation, substitution, and other operations, which are relevant to the issue at hand.

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
