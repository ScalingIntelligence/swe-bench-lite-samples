The error occurs specifically with `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` functions and does not occur with other unary functions like `sin` or `log`. The error also disappears under certain conditions, such as removing the division by `z` or the `exp` function. The focus seems to be on the interaction between `subs`, hyperbolic functions, and piecewise expressions. Given these details, the relevant code spans are likely to be found in the implementations of `Piecewise`, `Basic.subs`, and the hyperbolic functions themselves. The search results contain multiple implementations of `subs` across different modules, but the most relevant appears to be `Basic.subs` since it handles substitution more generically and is likely to be where the error occurs. Additionally, the `Piecewise` class is relevant as it is the structure causing the error. For hyperbolic functions, `sympy/plotting/intervalmath/lib_interval.py` contains rudimentary implementations of `sinh` and `cosh`, but they are less likely to be the root cause compared to the `Basic.subs` and `Piecewise` interactions.",

Since the error involves `Piecewise`, `sinh`, `cosh`, and the `subs` method, extending the search to related files and methods is crucial. We should look into files where these functions are defined and how they interact with the core functionalities of sympy, particularly substitution and symbolic operations.

The error arises specifically when real symbols for `x` and `y` are used. The issue mentions that it happens with 'cosh' or 'tanh' but not 'sinh', and it goes away if certain components like division by 'z' or the 'exp' function are removed. The main focus is on the `subs` method and the interaction with piecewise expressions.\n\nThe provided context includes relevant code spans from `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. These files contain spans that define the `Basic` class, its `subs` method, and the `Piecewise` class. These are crucial for understanding how substitution operations are handled and how piecewise functions are managed.\n\nThe new search results include more code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`. These files contain spans for functions like `exp`, `log`, `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`, which are directly related to the expressions mentioned in the issue. The spans for `exp._eval_subs`, `sinh.eval`, `cosh.eval`, and `tanh.eval` are particularly relevant as they show how these functions handle substitution and evaluation.\n\nGiven this data, I will focus on identifying the most relevant code spans that could help resolve the issue regarding the 'PolynomialError' with 'subs' and piecewise expressions involving hyperbolic functions.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
