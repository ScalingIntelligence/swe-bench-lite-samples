Given the diversity of possible causes, it's important to investigate the `Piecewise` class and its interaction with other functions, especially those involved in handling substitutions and mathematical operations.",

The analysis of the code spans provided in the search results and the current file context reveals that the `Piecewise._eval_subs` and `exp._eval_subs` methods are particularly relevant to this issue. These methods handle the substitution logic for `Piecewise` expressions and the exponential function, respectively. Given the similarity and potential connection between `cosh` and `sinh` in the context of hyperbolic functions, identifying the `SubstForHyperbolic` function in the 'sympy/integrals/rubi/utility_function.py' file is also relevant, as it contains logic for substituting hyperbolic functions. The identified spans offer insights into how substitutions are processed for both `Piecewise` expressions and exponential functions, and it is likely that issues related to type handling or assumptions in these methods could lead to the observed error.

The method iterates through the conditions and expressions, substituting the old value with the new one without specific handling for cases involving hyperbolic functions or real symbol assumptions. Similarly, the `exp` class's `_eval_subs` method does not show specific treatment of such cases, focusing more on handling exponential expressions generically. The `SubstForHyperbolic` function in `rubi/utility_function.py` is designed to handle substitutions specifically for hyperbolic functions, but it also operates independently of the `Piecewise` class, indicating a potential gap in the interaction between these functionalities. Given this, further investigation is needed within the `Piecewise` class on how it collaborates with other classes and functions during evaluation and substitutions, particularly in the presence of hyperbolic functions and real symbol assumptions.",
