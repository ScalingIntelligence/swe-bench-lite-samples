The error seems to be sensitive to the ordering of assumptions and the presence of certain functions like `cosh`, `tanh`, and the division by `z`. To identify the root cause, we should focus on the `Piecewise` class, the `exp` and `sinh` functions, and their interactions in the `subs()` method. Additionally, checking the implementation of the `subs()` method in the `Piecewise` class and related functions might provide insights.",

From the search results, the following spans seem relevant:\n1. In `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, the definition of `sinh` and its `eval` method could be relevant as they deal directly with the `sinh` function.\n2. In `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, the `Piecewise` class and its `_eval_subs` method are crucial as they handle substitutions within piecewise expressions, which is central to the issue.\n3. In `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `Basic.subs` method is fundamental as it is the main entry point for substitutions in SymPy expressions.\n4. In `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Subs._eval_subs` method is also relevant as it handles symbolic substitutions, which could interact with the piecewise and hyperbolic function behavior.\nThese spans cover the core functionalities that could be causing the `PolynomialError` when using the `subs` method with the provided expressions.",

Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
