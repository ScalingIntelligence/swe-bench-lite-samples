Several factors trigger or alleviate the error, such as the presence of `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh`, the inclusion of division, and the setting of symbol assumptions. Given the characteristics of the error, it is likely related to how the `Piecewise` function and hyperbolic functions interact within SymPy's substitution mechanism. Therefore, the search should focus on files where the `Piecewise`, `exp`, and hyperbolic function classes (`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`) are defined or utilized in substitution or evaluation logic.",

These methods directly deal with the evaluation and substitution of expressions involving piecewise conditions, which are central to the reported issue. \n\n2. **sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py** - The `sinh` and `cosh` classes and their `eval` methods are relevant as they handle the evaluation of hyperbolic functions, which are key elements of the expressions causing the error. \n\n3. **sympy/core/power.py** - The `Pow` class and its `_eval_subs` method are relevant because they handle the substitution of power expressions, which could be involved in the expressions causing the error. \n\n4. **sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py** - The `exp` class and its `_eval_subs` method are relevant as they handle the substitution of exponential expressions, which are involved in the hyperbolic functions used in the reported issue. \n\nThese code spans provide a comprehensive view of how expressions involving piecewise conditions, hyperbolic functions, and exponential functions are evaluated and substituted, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.",
