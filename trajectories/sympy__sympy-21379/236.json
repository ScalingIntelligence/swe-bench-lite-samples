            "scratch_pad": "First, the reported issue involves a `PolynomialError` related to the `subs()` method when handling expressions with hyperbolic functions and piecewise arguments. Key points include the error arising in specific conditions such as using specific hyperbolic functions and the involvement of real-valued symbols. The analysis starts by understanding the context provided in the issue description. The current file context is empty, indicating no previous identification of relevant code spans.\n\nMoving on to the analysis of new search results, specific attention is paid to spans related to the `subs()` method and hyperbolic functions. 'sympy/core/power.py' contains the `Pow._eval_subs` method, which might be relevant for handling substitutions within powers. Similarly, 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' contains the `sinh._eval_subs` method, which is not directly found but contains other relevant methods related to hyperbolic functions. There's also 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', which has a global `simplify` function that might indirectly affect substitution handling. In 'sympy/core/mul.py', the `Mul._eval_subs` is related but seems less directly relevant.\n\nFocusing on the most direct matches, the `Pow._eval_subs` in 'sympy/core/power.py' processes substitutions within powers and might be the ground zero for the error considering the expression's structure in the issue. The reported issue's specific conditions like the type of hyperbolic function involved and the use of real symbols also align with the `sinh.eval` method in 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py'.\n\nGiven these observations, the focus shifts to understanding how evaluations are handled within these specific sections of the code. The `Pow._eval_subs` method is intricate, dealing with commutative and noncommutative substitutions within powers. The mention of 'PolynomialError' in the issue ties back to possible miscalculations or assumptions about polynomial structures in substitution operations.\n\nIn conclusion, the identified spans in 'sympy/core/power.py' and 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' appear to be the most relevant to the reported issue. These sections handle substitution operations and evaluations of hyperbolic functions, aligning them closely with the problem context, especially considering the error's manifestation with specific functions and assumptions about symbol types.",

The issue is related to unexpected `PolynomialError` when using `subs` for particular expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. From the provided context, the relevant files are `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, specifically focusing on the `Pow` class and its methods `_eval_subs`, `_eval_power`, and `as_numer_denom`. These methods are critical for understanding how substitution and power evaluation are handled in SymPy.\n\nNext, I examined the new search results from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`. The `Piecewise` class in `piecewise.py` contains methods that are crucial for handling piecewise expressions, which are central to the reported issue. The `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_ITE` methods in the `Piecewise` class provide insights into how piecewise expressions are evaluated and substituted. Additionally, the `trigonometric.py` file contains the `sin` and `tan` classes, focusing on their `eval` method which handles evaluation of trigonometric functions.\n\nConsidering the issue's focus on hyperbolic functions with piecewise arguments and the error occurring during substitution, the methods and classes related to piecewise expressions, hyperbolic functions, and substitution are highly relevant. Specifically, the `Piecewise._eval_subs` method is particularly important as it deals directly with how substitutions are handled in piecewise expressions. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
