The key elements in the issue include the `subs()` method, hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh), piecewise arguments, and specific assumptions about the symbols involved. The provided search results include code spans related to these elements: `Piecewise` and its `_eval_subs` method, `exp`, `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` functions, and their respective methods. These code spans directly relate to the elements mentioned in the reported issue, suggesting that they are relevant to the observed behavior. Given the direct correlation between the code spans in the search results and the elements of the reported issue, I conclude that the relevant code spans have been identified.",

The issue is about encountering a `PolynomialError` when using `subs()` for particular expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. The error seems to be specific to certain conditions and expressions, such as using real symbols for `x` and `y` and involving functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh`. I looked through the search results to find any code spans that could be related to this issue. The relevant code spans include the `Piecewise` class for handling piecewise functions and their substitution, as well as the `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` classes for evaluating and manipulating hyperbolic functions. These spans include methods for evaluation, substitution, and handling of expressions, which are likely to be involved in the error described in the issue. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
