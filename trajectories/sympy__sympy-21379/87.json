The error is triggered under specific conditions, especially when the symbols are assumed to be real. To debug this issue, we need to search for the implementation of the `subs()` method in SymPy, focusing on files dealing with expressions, piecewise functions, and hyperbolic functions. Additionally, it's crucial to look at how the `Piecewise` class handles substitutions and how the assumptions affect the behavior of the expressions.",
