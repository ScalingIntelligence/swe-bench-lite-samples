The `PolynomialError` arises specifically with certain combinations of hyperbolic functions, piecewise arguments, and division. It's likely that the source of the error lies within the handling of piecewise functions or the specific substitutions being attempted. Given the symptoms, investigating the `subs()` method implementations in `Pow`, `Piecewise`, and `exp` classes in addition to the utility functions related to hyperbolics and trigonometric substitutions might be useful.",

The issue seems to be related to the specific structure of the expression and assumptions about real symbols. The search results contain code spans related to `exp`, `Piecewise`, and the `subs()` method, which are relevant to the reported issue. Specifically, the `exp` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` contains the `_eval_subs` method, which is potentially relevant for understanding how substitutions are handled in expressions involving `exp`. Similarly, the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` contains the `_eval_subs` method, which is directly related to handling substitutions in piecewise functions. Additionally, the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` also contains the `_eval_subs` method, which is relevant for understanding how substitutions in power functions are handled.

There is no direct mention of `PolynomialError`, nor specific handling of hyperbolic sinusoids or detailed checks on piecewise functions within the `subs` method. However, the issue's description points towards deeper, unresolved issues with Sympy's handling of these functions in combination, which are likely embedded within or create clashes with the existing methods.

Given the identified files and methods, specifically the `_eval_subs` methods in `Pow`, `Piecewise`, and `exp` classes, it's clear that these components play key roles in the substitution process. To pinpoint the exact cause of the `PolynomialError`, it might be necessary to examine how these classes process and interact with the substitution of hyperbolic functions and piecewise expressions, potentially under specific conditions related to division and real number assumptions. Additionally, reviewing test cases or example usages that might trigger this error could help in understanding the exact conditions necessary for the error to occur. Therefore, a targeted search around the `_eval_subs` methods in these classes, particularly focusing on interactions involving hyperbolic functions, piecewise expressions, and potential errors or edge cases, might lead to the source of the issue.",

Key points from the issue include: 1. The error happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`. 2. The error goes away if removing the division by `z`. 3. The error goes away if removing `exp`. 4. The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y`. Based on these points, the issue seems to be related to the interaction between `Piecewise` and the functions `exp`, `cosh`, `tanh`, and perhaps `subs`. The search results provide code spans related to `Piecewise._eval_subs`, `exp._eval_subs`, and `Pow._eval_subs`. These spans are relevant because they directly handle substitutions and are likely places where the error could originate. Additionally, the `Pow` class handles powers and could be part of the issue since the error goes away if removing `exp`. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those dealing with `subs` specifically for `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `Pow`.",

The key components identified in the issue were: \n\n1. The expression `exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))` and its variations. \n2. The `subs()` method and its interaction with this expression, particularly with `1: 1.0` substitution. \n3. The occurrence of `PolynomialError` in specific conditions, such as when `cosh` or `tanh` replace `sinh`. \n\nGiven the identified files and their contexts, particularly `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, I concentrated on the `_eval_subs` methods in these files. This is because the reported issue is clearly related to how the `subs` method behaves for the mentioned expressions, especially with the conditional pieces and arithmetic manipulations in place. I considered each code span within these context sections to see if they specifically deal with the expressions or handling conditions that lead to the `PolynomialError`. \n\nFurthermore, I noted the additional rewrite methods that are defined for exponential functions, like `_eval_rewrite_as_cos`, `_eval_rewrite_as_tanh`, and others. These functions rewrite expressions into different but equivalent forms, and understanding their implementation could provide insights into how Sympy might be handling the types of expressions mentioned in the issue.\n\nAfter analyzing the code spans in the provided `search_results`, I determined the following are relevant based on the reported issue:\n\n- `exp._eval_subs`: This function deals with the implementation of the `subs` method for the `exp` function, which is critical since the issue arises when using `subs` on expressions involving `exp` with particular substitutions.\n- `Piecewise._eval_subs`: Similar to `exp._eval_subs`, this function provides the `subs` behavior for `Piecewise` objects, which is essential as the error is reported with expressions containing `Piecewise`. \n- `Pow._eval_subs`: This function provides the `subs` behavior for `Pow` objects and can handle fractional powers and non-commutative symbols, which could relate to how expressions are simplified or evaluated leading to the reported error. \n\nOverall, the focus was on identifying functions that directly process or alter expressions like those causing the error, specifically those involving `exp`, `Piecewise`, and arithmetic transformations.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
