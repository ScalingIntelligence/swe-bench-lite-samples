The error is triggered under specific conditions related to the assumptions about the symbols and the structure of the expression.

Key points to consider: 1. The error arises when certain expressions with piecewise arguments and hyperbolic functions are substituted. 2. The error is triggered under specific conditions related to the expression's structure and assumptions about symbols. 3. The error involves handling of Piecewise functions and their interaction with hyperbolic functions during substitution. Given these points, the relevant code spans likely involve the implementation of Piecewise functions, the `subs()` method for expressions, and the handling of hyperbolic functions within these expressions. From the search results, the following code spans are identified as relevant: `Piecewise`, `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise.eval`, `Piecewise._eval_subs` from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, and `sinh`, `sinh._eval_subs` from `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`.

The issue is specific to certain conditions involving `x`, `y`, `z` symbols and their assumptions. The search results and file context provided include relevant code spans for the `Piecewise` class and the hyperbolic functions (`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`). Specifically, the `Piecewise.eval`, `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise._eval_subs` methods are relevant for handling piecewise evaluations and substitutions. Additionally, the `sinh.eval`, `cosh.eval`, and `tanh.eval` methods are relevant for evaluating the hyperbolic functions. These methods handle the evaluation of the functions under different conditions and can be used to trace where the unexpected `PolynomialError` may arise. The `exp.eval` method from the exponential module is also relevant as it interacts with the hyperbolic functions. Given the comprehensive coverage of the relevant code spans in the search results, it appears that the search task can be considered complete.",

From the provided context, the `_eval_subs` method in `Piecewise` has been identified as a critical part of this interaction. The method loops through each argument (pair of expression and condition) of the `Piecewise` object and applies substitutions to both the expression and the condition. If the condition evaluates to `True`, it exits the loop early. It's also notable that the method handles cases where expressions are shared among different conditions, suggesting an overlap or redundancy in the conditions might lead to errors.

The analysis of the provided code spans two files: `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`. The main focus areas in the provided code for addressing the issue are the `Piecewise` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `eval`, `_eval_subs`, and `_handle_irel` in `piecewise.py`, and the `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` classes and their `eval` methods in `hyperbolic.py`. These sections handle the creation, evaluation, and substitution of piecewise expressions and the evaluation of hyperbolic functions, which are key to understanding and potentially resolving the issue. The new search results expand on these sections, providing additional methods within the `Piecewise` class like `_eval_nseries` and `_eval_power`, and additional classes like `coth` in `hyperbolic.py`. These expansions are relevant as they provide more context on how piecewise expressions and hyperbolic functions are handled in SymPy, potentially shedding light on the cause of the `PolynomialError`. The inclusion of these additional sections broadens the understanding of the codebase's handling of piecewise and hyperbolic functions, which is crucial for diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue.",
