The error is specifically triggered when certain conditions are met, such as using real symbols for `x` and `y` and certain compositions of functions like `exp` and `sinh` with piecewise arguments. To pinpoint the issue, focusing on the `Piecewise` class and its interaction with these functions, especially in the `_eval_subs` method, would be beneficial. Additionally, understanding how the `exp` and `sinh` functions handle substitutions in the presence of piecewise arguments would also be crucial.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves an unexpected 'PolynomialError' when using the `subs` method for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids and piecewise arguments. Key elements to look for in the code spans are the methods and functions related to `subs`, `Piecewise`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, and the handling of symbolic expressions involving these functions. Analyzing the provided code spans, the following sections are relevant to the issue: 1. The `Piecewise` class and its methods like `__new__`, `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_subs`, etc., which handle the creation and evaluation of piecewise expressions. 2. The `_eval_subs` method in classes like `Pow`, `Derivative`, `Subs`, `Mul`, and `Add`, which are responsible for substituting values in expressions. These methods are crucial for understanding how substitutions are handled and potentially where errors might occur. The code spans describe how the `subs` method is implemented for various types of expressions and how conditions might affect these substitutions. Therefore, these sections should be reviewed in detail to find the root cause of the 'PolynomialError'.",

You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
