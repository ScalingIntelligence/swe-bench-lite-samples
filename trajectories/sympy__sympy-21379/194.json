These modules are relevant to the issue as they handle the evaluation, substitution, and manipulation of expressions involving Piecewise, hyperbolic functions, and their interactions.

The `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is critical for handling piecewise expressions, especially the `_eval_subs` method which is relevant for substitutions. The hyperbolic functions like sinh, cosh, and tanh are defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, which should interact with `subs()` through their own `_eval_subs` methods if they exist. The `exp` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` is also important, particularly for handling expressions involving hyperbolic functions and piecewise arguments through its `_eval_subs` method. Additionally, the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` has an `_eval_subs` method that might be involved in complex substitutions, especially when dealing with powers of hyperbolic functions or piecewise expressions. The `Mul` class in `sympy/core/mul.py` and the `Function` class in `sympy/core/function.py` also contain methods for handling substitutions, making them relevant. Given the nature of the issue, involving interactions between piecewise conditions, hyperbolic functions, and potential errors during substitution, these files and their methods are central to the issue at hand. However, while all these files are relevant, they cover different aspects (elementary functions, core functional, and logic), and it appears that none of them have direct connections to each other beyond their common involvement with the issue. While each file context is useful in its own right, there might be a need to understand how they interact with each other better, possibly involving more directed analysis with actualSymPy methods.",

This might reveal more about how errors like 'PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense' arise and where the implementation might be missing or unclear in handling such scenarios."

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
