The analysis of the search results reveals several relevant pieces of code. \n\n1. In `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, the `Piecewise` class definition and its `_eval_subs` method are relevant. The `_eval_subs` method handles the substitution of values within piecewise expressions, which is directly related to the reported issue. This method iterates through the arguments of the piecewise function, performing substitutions as needed.\n\n2. In `sympy/core/power.py`, the `Pow` class contains the `_eval_subs` method, which is responsible for handling substitutions within power expressions. Since the issue involves expressions wrapped in `exp` functions, it is crucial to understand how substitutions are handled at this level. The method checks for various conditions to determine if a substitution can be made.\n\n3. In `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, the `exp` class (representing the exponential function) includes the `_eval_subs` method. This method is relevant because the issue involves expressions that apply the `exp` function to the problematic piecewise expression. The method handles substitutions specifically within exponential expressions, including cases where the substitution might involve another power expression.\n\nCombining these observations, the identified code spans (from their respective span IDs) appear to be directly relevant to the issue concerning `subs()` and how it might affect the evaluation of expressions involving piecewise arguments and exponential functions.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
