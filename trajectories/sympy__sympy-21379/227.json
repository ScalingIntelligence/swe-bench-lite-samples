This error is specific to certain conditions and symbol assumptions. Given the nature of the error and the behavior observed with different functions and operations, the focus should be on the implementation of `subs()` in classes dealing with expressions, particularly those handling piecewise functions, hyperbolic functions, and exponential functions. The provided file context suggests relevant files, such as `piecewise.py`, `power.py`, and `exponential.py`, which contain methods like `_eval_subs()` and `_eval_rewrite_*` potentially involved in the substitution and evaluation of these expressions. Additionally, `utility_function.py` contains functions related to trigonometric and hyperbolic substitutions, further implicating it in the handling of these expressions.",

The issue seems to be related to the handling of such expressions, particularly when casting int to float before using `tensorflow.lambdify`. The reported issue points to specific conditions and assumptions that trigger the error (e.g., using `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, division by `z`, and assumptions about symbols being real). I will look for code spans in the provided search results that deal with the handling of piecewise expressions, particularly focusing on the `Piecewise` class and methods like `_eval_subs` since `subs()` is likely involved. Additionally, I will examine the `exp` and `sinh` functions to understand their interaction with these expressions.",

The issue seems to be related to the handling of assumptions and conditions within these expressions. From the provided file context and search results, several key areas of relevance can be identified: 1. The `Piecewise` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `_handle_irel`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_integral` which are crucial for constructing and manipulating piecewise functions. 2. The `exp` class from the `elementary/exponential.py` file, particularly the `_eval_nseries` method, is relevant as the expression involves exponentiation. 3. The `HyperbolicFunction` class and its subclasses such as `sinh`, `acosh`, and `asech` from `elementary/hyperbolic.py` are directly involved in the expressions. 4. The `PolynomialError` class and related errors from `polys/polyerrors.py` are central to understanding the error being reported. These sections should provide a sufficient basis to understand and possibly resolve the issue regarding the `PolynomialError` during substitution in expressions.",

The error is specifically related to the order of assumptions in the expression.

I will look at the `Piecewise` class and its methods such as `_eval_subs` and `Piecewise._handle_irel` in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`.\n\n2. **Exponential and Hyperbolic Module**: The expression involves `exp` and `sinh` functions. I will inspect the `_eval_nseries` method in the `exp` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` to understand how series expansions are handled.\n\n3. **Polynomial Errors Module**: Since the error is a `PolynomialError`, it's crucial to understand the conditions under which this error is raised. I will review the `PolynomialError` class in `sympy/polys/polyerrors.py`.\n\n4. **General Analysis**: I will also look at methods like `_eval_is_positive`, `_eval_is_negative`, and `_eval_is_zero` in the `sinh` class to see if any assumptions about the arguments might lead to errors. Additionally, I'll inspect the `acosh` and `asech` classes for any relevant methods that handle hyperbolic arguments.\n\nBy examining these specific parts of the code, I aim to identify where the assumptions about the expression's components might be conflicting or leading to the unexpected `PolynomialError`.",
