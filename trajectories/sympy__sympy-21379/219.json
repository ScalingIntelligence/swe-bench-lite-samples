The key elements identified from the issue include `Piecewise`, `sinh`, `exp`, and the behavior of `subs()`. The search results provide several relevant code spans within `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`. Specifically, the `Piecewise` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `eval`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_interval` are relevant for understanding how `Piecewise` expressions are handled, especially during substitution. Additionally, the `sinh` class's `eval` and related evaluation methods in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` are pertinent, as they detail how the hyperbolic sine function is evaluated and its properties checked. Also, `sympy/core/power.py` contains the definition of the `Pow` class, which is likely involved in the evaluation of expressions involving exponentiation, such as `exp` in the context of the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that directly handle `Piecewise` and `sinh` logic, as well as the substitution (`_eval_subs`) and evaluation (`eval`, `_eval_interval`) methods, to form a comprehensive understanding of the observed error during the `subs()` operation.",

Within the `Piecewise` class, methods such as `_eval_subs`, `_eval_interval`, and `__new__` are particularly relevant as they handle substitutions and condition evaluation. However, the direct handling of the 'PolynomialError' or the interaction at the point where the error is raised is not evident in the provided file context. The `sinh` class implementation provides the basis for the hyperbolic function component, but it does not directly show the integration or error handling context specific to the issue reported.

Given the detailed list of conditions under which the error arises, the analysis focuses on identifying code related to `Piecewise`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, and `exp` functions, as well as their interactions with real symbols and handling of conditions.\n\nIn the provided search results and file context, key sections related to `Piecewise`, especially `Piecewise.eval`, `Piecewise.doit`, `Piecewise._eval_subs`, and `Piecewise._eval_interval`, offer functionalities critical for evaluating, substituting, and handling intervals in piecewise expressions. Meanwhile, sections related to `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`, including their `eval` methods, describe conditions for evaluation, which directly relate to the `sym` argument of piecewise functions.\n\nThough the search results do not directly lead to specific causes or fixes for the `PolynomialError`, they clearly outline how piecewise expressions and hyperbolic functions are evaluated, which is crucial for diagnosing or fixing the error. The provided code, especially the handling of conditions in `Piecewise` and `eval` methods for hyperbolic functions, is fundamental for any potential debugging or troubleshooting related to the error. Given the alignment of the provided code with the described issue, especially concerning type handling and assumptions, these sections are deemed relevant and sufficient for addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
