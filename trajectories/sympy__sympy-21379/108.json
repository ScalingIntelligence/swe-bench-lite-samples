To debug this, it's crucial to focus on functions and classes that handle substitution, piecewise expressions, and hyperbolic functions within the Sympy library. Key files to check include those related to `Piecewise`, `exp`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, and any other functions that might interact with these in complex expressions. Additionally, understanding how substitution logic interacts with these functions under different conditions is essential.",

The issue seems to be linked to how Sympy handles substitutions in these contexts, particularly when symbols have specific assumptions. Key points from the issue include: the error arises with `cosh` or `tanh` but not `sinh`, the presence of division by `z` or `exp` can trigger the error, and the error is more likely with real symbols for `x` and `y`. Based on this, the goal is to find code spans in the provided search results that might be relevant to handling or evaluating substitutions in expressions with these characteristics.\n\nReviewing the current file context, there are already some identified files like `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` which contain methods like `_eval_subs` in classes `Pow` and `Piecewise` that are likely to be involved in the substitution process.\n\nExamining the new search results, several files contain methods for `_eval_subs` which are potential candidates for addressing the issue: `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, `sympy/core/function.py`, `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/mul.py`, `sympy/core/add.py`, `sympy/series/order.py`, `sympy/concrete/expr_with_limits.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, and `sympy/physics/control/lti.py`. Notably, `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` appear again, highlighting their importance in handling expressions involving piecewise and exponential components, respectively.\n\nFrom these results, the relevant code spans that are likely to be involved in solving the reported issue are those from `_eval_subs` methods in `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `Pow` classes, as they directly handle the substitution logic for expressions that might involve piecewise components, exponential functions, and powers, which align closely with the reported problem.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
