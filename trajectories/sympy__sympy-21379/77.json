The error message `PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense` suggests that there might be a problem with how the Piecewise function is handled within the `subs()` method when certain conditions are met. Given the behavior described, it seems to be sensitive to the presence of specific functions (cosh, tanh) and assumptions about symbol types (real). To pinpoint the issue, we should focus on the `subs()` method implementations in classes that deal with Piecewise functions and hyperbolic functions, such as `Pow`, `exp_polar`, `Piecewise`, and possibly `exp`. Additionally, understanding how symbolic substitutions interact with these functions could provide clues. Considering the error occurs specifically with certain types of expressions, the search should prioritize functions and methods directly involved in handling these expressions and their components.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a `PolynomialError` when using the `subs` method with specific expressions containing hyperbolic sinusoids and piecewise arguments in SymPy. The error is observed when substituting certain values in expressions involving `exp`, `sinh`, and `Piecewise`. The primary goal is to identify the relevant code spans responsible for handling such substitutions and potentially causing the error. \n\nFirst, we examine the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. The `_eval_subs` method in this class is critical as it handles substitutions within piecewise functions. It iterates through the conditions and expressions, performing substitutions and returning a new `Piecewise` object if any substitutions are made. This method is directly relevant to the issue at hand since it involves a piecewise function.\n\nNext, we look at `sympy/core/power.py`, which contains the `Pow` class with its `_eval_subs` method. This method is essential for handling substitutions in power expressions, which are central to the problematic expressions involving `exp` and `sinh`. The method checks for various substitution scenarios, including those involving logarithms and exponents, which are pertinent to the issue.\n\nLastly, we review `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`. Here, the `exp` class includes an `_eval_subs` method that specifically handles substitutions for exponential functions. Given the involvement of `exp` in the reported issue, this method is highly relevant. It manages substitutions involving logarithms, power bases, and exponents, directly addressing the components of the expression causing the error.\n\nThese three code spans - `Piecewise._eval_subs`, `Pow._eval_subs`, and `exp._eval_subs` - are directly linked to the components (`Piecewise`, `exp`, and `Pow`) and the operations (`subs`) involved in the reported issue. Therefore, they should be the focus for further investigation to determine the root cause of the `PolynomialError`.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
