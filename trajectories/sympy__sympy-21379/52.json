These errors occur under specific conditions, such as with real symbols for `x` and `y`, and with certain functions like `cosh` or `tanh`. The error message suggests that the problem may be related to how the Piecewise function is handled within these expressions. It's likely that the issue lies in the implementation of these functions or their interaction within the expression. Investigate the `Piecewise` class methods in `piecewise.py`, `exp` and `sinh` functions in `exponential.py`, and any related utility functions in files like `power.py`, `trigsimp.py`, and `heurisch.py`.",

The analysis of the search results should focus on the `Piecewise` class and its methods, particularly those related to substitution and evaluation (like `_eval_subs`, `__new__`, and `_eval_interval`). Additionally, the expression involves `exp`, so the `exp` class and its `_eval_subs` method are also relevant. The `Pow` class from `sympy/core/power.py` might also be involved due to the presence of `exp` and potential interactions with powers. Furthermore, the issue's specific conditions (like only occurring with real symbols for `x` and `y`) suggest that assumptions and conditions handling within the `Piecewise` class are crucial. The provided spans include several potentially relevant sections, such as `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise._eval_subs`, and `exp._eval_subs`. Each of these spans directly deals with the creation, substitution, and evaluation of `Piecewise` and `exp` expressions, which are central to the issue. Given these points, the identified spans are relevant and should be considered for further investigation or potential fixes related to the reported issue.",

If a condition evaluates to `True`, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the substitution has been successfully applied. The `exp` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` also has a `_eval_subs` method that specifically handles cases where the substitution is for a power or exponential function.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a `PolynomialError` when using `subs()` on expressions containing hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. The issue arises under specific conditions, such as when certain assumptions are made about the symbols. The error is described as occurring with `cosh` or `tanh` instead of `sinh`, and is influenced by the presence of division by `z` and the `exp` function. The symbols' real assumptions and the cache clearing also seem to play a role in triggering the error. \n\nFrom the analysis of the search results and the issue description, the most relevant code spans are found in the following files and spans:\n\n1. `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` contains the implementation of `Piecewise` and its methods `__new__` and `_eval_subs`. These methods are directly related to the handling of piecewise expressions, which are central to the issue described.\n\n2. `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` contains the implementation of `sinh` and its methods such as `eval`, `_eval_expand_trig`, and `_eval_is_extended_real`. These methods are relevant as they deal with the evaluation and properties of the hyperbolic sine function, which is part of the problematic expression.\n\n3. `sympy/core/power.py` contains the implementation of `Pow` and its method `_eval_is_algebraic_expr`. Although the issue is not directly about powers, the `exp` function in the expression can be rewritten as a power, making this method indirectly relevant.\n\n4. `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` contains the method `exptrigsimp`, which is involved in simplifying expressions involving exponentials and trigonometric functions. Given the expression's use of `exp` with hyperbolic sinusoids, this method could potentially impact the behavior.\n\nWhile the search results did not directly identify a specific section of code responsible for the `PolynomialError`, the identified spans in the `Piecewise` and `sinh` implementations are the most closely related to the described issue. Further debugging or additional search results may be needed to pinpoint the exact cause of the error.",

The issue involves a `PolynomialError` when using `subs()` for expressions involving hyperbolic functions with piecewise arguments. Key elements to look for include `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `exp`, `subs()`, and `Piecewise`. I will analyze the provided search results and the current file context to find the relevant code spans that could be causing the error. Based on the provided search results and the context, we have several relevant code spans in sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py, sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py, and sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py. These files contain implementations and evaluations for `sinh`, `exp`, `Piecewise`, and their substitution logic. The identified spans include specific methods such as `sinh.eval`, `Piecewise._eval_subs`, and `exp._eval_subs`, which directly deal with the evaluation and substitution of these elements.",
