The `PolynomialError` mentioned in the issue might arise due to the complexity of handling piecewise expressions within hyperbolic functions during substitution. The presence of this method confirms that the relevant code for handling substitutions within `Piecewise` expressions is present. Additionally, the `subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` supports the substitution process but does not directly address the `PolynomialError` due to the intricacies of piecewise and hyperbolic function interactions.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
