The error, `PolynomialError`, arises when certain conditions are met, such as the use of `cosh` or `tanh` instead of `sinh`, the presence of division by `z`, and the assumption of real symbols for `x` and `y`. The provided search results include the `Piecewise` class from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, which is relevant as it contains the `_eval_subs` method. This method is crucial for understanding how substitutions are handled within piecewise functions. The provided code span for `Piecewise._eval_subs` shows how the `_eval_subs` method processes substitution for Piecewise objects, which directly relates to the error context mentioned in the issue. By analyzing the `_eval_subs` method, we can see how substitutions are applied to each argument and how the method handles the condition when no arguments exist to substitute into. This understanding is key to potentially identifying and fixing the root cause of the `PolynomialError`.",

Other files like `sympy/functions/special/delta_functions.py` contain functions (`DiracDelta`, `Heaviside`) that can potentially interact with `Piecewise` or `exp` during substitutions, though they are not directly involved in the provided expression.\n\nBased on these observations, the focus should be on the spans of code in `Piecewise`, `exp`, and potentially any other functions that might interact with these during the substitution process.",

The absence of explicit handling in 'piecewise.py' for these functions does raise concerns about deeper compatibility issues in complex substitution scenarios.

The search results provide implementations of `Piecewise._eval_subs`, `exp._eval_subs`, and other components like `cot._eval_subs` and error functions which might also be relevant in understanding or debugging the issue. Furthermore, the issue suggests investigating the order of assumptions in expressions, making the context of symbol assumptions and their handling in functions like `Piecewise` crucial.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
