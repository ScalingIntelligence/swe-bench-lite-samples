The error occurs in specific conditions, such as when using `cosh` or `tanh` instead of `sinh`, or when dividing by `z`. The issue seems to be related to the assumptions about the symbols and the order of operations in the expression. To address this, we need to closely examine the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the `subs` method for these functions and symbols, particularly focusing on the `sinh` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and the `subs` method implementations in `sympy/core/function.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, and other related files. These code spans are likely to contain the logic that determines how substitutions are performed and which assumptions are considered during these operations.",

However, after further analysis, it seems that the issue might be more deeply rooted in how the Piecewise conditions interact with the assumptions and possibly the cache. The provided context suggests that the error is triggered specifically when certain assumptions are made about the symbols and when these symbols are involved in Piecewise expressions within hyperbolic functions. Given this, it's crucial to ensure that Piecewise expressions are correctly managed under different assumptions and cache states. I will now focus on updating the handling of assumptions in Piecewise expressions to ensure that they are correctly considered during substitution.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
