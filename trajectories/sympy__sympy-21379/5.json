The error 'PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense' is key to identifying the problematic code. The error seems to be triggered by certain conditions, such as the presence of specific functions (like `cosh` or `tanh`), real symbols (for `x` and `y`), and the structure of the expression. Focusing on the `Piecewise` class and its associated methods, along with the `subs()` method in related classes like `Pow` and `exp`, would be a good start. Additionally, considering other places where `Piecewise` is evaluated or transformed, such as in simplification or rewriting methods, could also be beneficial.",

Key elements to focus on include the `PolynomialError` with the message 'Piecewise generators do not make sense', the `Piecewise` class and its methods, and the `exp` function along with its `_eval_subs` method. The search results include relevant components such as the `PolynomialError` definition in `sympy/__init__.py`, the `Piecewise` class and its methods in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, and the `exp` class and its `_eval_subs` method in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`.

The `Piecewise` class and its associated methods, especially `_eval_subs`, are directly implicated in handling such expressions.

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
