            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves unexpected `PolynomialError` when using `subs` with expressions containing hyperbolic sinusoids and piecewise arguments in Sympy version 1.8.dev. Key observations include the error being specific to certain functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh`, and it disappears under certain conditions such as removing the division by `z` or the `exp` function. Given the details, it's likely that the issue is within the handling of these specific functions in combination with piecewise expressions during substitution. It's also notable that the error is tied to the real assumptions on symbols. Therefore, the search should focus on functions and classes related to hyperbolic functions, piecewise expressions, and their interaction during substitution.",

Analyzing the reported issue, it is clear that the problem arises when using the `subs()` method with certain expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. The issue is specifically related to handling of such expressions in `subs()`. 2. Reviewing the current file context, it shows that the relevant files are `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`. The focus is particularly on the `Piecewise` class and its methods like `_eval_subs()`, `_handle_irel()`, and the hyperbolic functions like `sinh`. 3. Analyzing the new search results, the most relevant code spans are in the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file, particularly the `Piecewise._eval_subs()` method which handles the substitution logic, and `Piecewise._handle_irel()` which handles relational expressions within `Piecewise`. Also relevant is `sinh._eval_rewrite_as_tractable()` in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` which shows how `sinh` can be rewritten in terms of exponential functions, which might be related to the error in `subs()`. 4. Based on the analysis, the key areas to focus on are the methods in `Piecewise` that handle substitutions and manipulations of `Piecewise` expressions, as well as any related functions like `sinh` that might be involved in complex substitutions.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
