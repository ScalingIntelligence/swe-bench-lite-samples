The primary areas to investigate are the `Piecewise` class, the `_eval_subs` method within various classes (like `Pow`, `exp_polar`, `exp`), and utility functions related to hyperbolic and trigonometric substitutions. Given the specific conditions under which the error arises, it's crucial to focus on the methods that handle substitution and evaluation of piecewise functions and their interaction with hyperbolic functions.",

The issue is specific to certain conditions involving hyperbolic functions, piecewise arguments, and the order of assumptions. The search results include relevant code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, and `sympy/core/power.py` that deal with handling substitutions and piecewise functions. Specifically, the `Piecewise._eval_subs` method is highlighted, which is relevant as it deals with substitutions in piecewise functions. Additionally, the `exp._eval_subs` and `Pow._eval_subs` methods are identified as relevant since they handle substitutions for exponential and power functions, which are part of the reported expressions. The `SubstForHyperbolic` function in `sympy/integrals/rubi/utility_function.py` is also relevant as it deals with substitutions involving hyperbolic functions, which are central to the issue. Overall, these code spans appear to be pertinent to the reported issue and could contain the necessary logic to address the `PolynomialError`. It is recommended to closely examine the logic within these spans to understand how substitutions are handled in the presence of piecewise arguments and hyperbolic functions, and to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
