The trace indicates that the error specifically mentions 'Piecewise generators do not make sense', suggesting a problem in the handling of Piecewise functions within the `subs()` method. Given this, the search for relevant code should focus on the `Piecewise` class and its interaction with the `subs()` method, particularly in the context of hyperbolic functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`. The search results include several relevant sections from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, which detail the implementation of the `Piecewise` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_subs`, and others. These methods are critical as they handle the creation, evaluation, and substitution of Piecewise expressions. Additionally, the `_eval_subs` method is of particular interest as it directly relates to the `subs()` functionality. Furthermore, the search results from `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` provide context on how hyperbolic functions like `tanh` are defined and their attributes evaluated, which could be indirectly relevant to understanding how they interact with Piecewise functions during substitutions.

I then examined the current file context, particularly focusing on the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and the `tanh` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`. In the new search results, I found additional spans related to the `HyperbolicFunction` and `sinh` classes, which could be relevant. Particularly, the `tanh._eval_rewrite_as_tanh` method in the `sinh` class could be useful for understanding the error related to hyperbolic functions. The `tanh.eval` method and its related methods (like checking for real, positive, or zero values) could also be pertinent to the reported issue. Considering all these, I identified the relevant file and spans based on their relevance to piecewise expressions and hyperbolic functions in the context of the reported issue.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
