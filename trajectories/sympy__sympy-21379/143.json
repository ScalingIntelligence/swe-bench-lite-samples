It is mentioned that the error only occurs with real symbols for `x` and `y`, specifically when using these functions within an exponential context and involving division by `z`. The search results contain relevant spans of code in `sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise`, `sympy.functions.elementary.exponential`, and `sympy.core.function` which handle the `Piecewise` class, the `exp` function, and the `subs` method implementations. These sections may contain the logic that is causing the issue when the piecewise function is combined with specific assumptions and operations. Additional analysis might involve reviewing the interaction between piecewise functions and the exponential functions' implementations when subjected to substitutions and assumptions about real variables.",

The provided search results include code spans from `Piecewise`, `exp`, `Derivative`, and `Subs` classes, which are likely relevant to the issue, especially given the presence of piecewise arguments and the `exp` function in the user's expressions.\n\nThe `Piecewise` class is particularly relevant as it directly deals with piecewise functions and conditions, which are central to the user's expression. Relevant methods include `_eval_subs`, `_eval_interval`, `_intervals`, and `eval`, which handle substitution, interval evaluation, interval calculation, and evaluation of piecewise functions, respectively.\n\nThe `exp` class is also relevant as it represents the exponential function, which is used in the user's expression. Relevant methods within this class include `_eval_subs`, `eval`, and various rewrite methods, which handle substitution, evaluation, and rewriting of exponential functions.\n\nThe `Derivative` and `Subs` classes are likely less directly relevant but could still be peripherally involved depending on how SymPy handles derivatives and substitutions internally. Their `_eval_subs` methods might be relevant if the issue somehow involves differentiating or substituting with respect to certain variables.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, the identified relevant spans largely come from the `Piecewise` and `exp` classes, where the core functionality of handling piecewise and exponential operations lies.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
