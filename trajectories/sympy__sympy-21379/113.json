            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves unexpected behavior with `subs` for particular expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments, leading to a `PolynomialError`. The analysis of the search results reveals several potential areas of interest that might relate to the issue: \n\n1. **sympy/core/power.py** - This file contains the `Pow` class and its methods `_eval_power` and `_eval_subs`. These methods are critical for understanding how powers and substitutions are handled in SymPy, which is directly related to the reported issue with `subs` and expressions involving `exp` and `sinh`. Specifically, the `_eval_subs` method deals with substitutions in powers, which could be where the error arises when attempting a substitution on an expression involving `Piecewise`. The handling of `Piecewise` generators in this context is not explicitly covered in the spans provided, suggesting a potential gap or issue with how `Piecewise` expressions are managed within the power and substitution logic.\n\n2. **sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py** - This file contains the `exp` class and its `_eval_subs` method. Given the nature of the issue involving `exp` and `sinh`, this method is crucial for understanding how substitutions involving exponential functions are handled. The method includes specific handling for `exp` and `Pow`, indicating that complex expressions like those involving `Piecewise` inside `exp` might not be fully supported or properly handled, leading to the observed error.\n\n3. **sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py** - This file contains the `Piecewise` class, which is central to the reported issue as the problematic expressions involve `Piecewise` arguments. The `_eval_power` and `_eval_subs` methods for `Piecewise` are relevant here, as they show how `Piecewise` expressions are managed when raised to powers or subjected to substitutions. The lack of specific handling for `Piecewise` inside more complex expressions (like those involving `exp`) within these methods suggests a potential point of failure, leading to the unexpected `PolynomialError`.\n\nThese observations suggest that the core issue likely lies in the interaction between these components when handling complex expressions involving `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `sinh`. The code spans provided do not directly address the specific error reported, indicating a potential gap in the handling of such complex substitutions. Further investigation into how these components interact could help pinpoint the exact cause of the error.",

Particularly relevant are the code spans for `sinh`, `cosh`, `exp`, and `Piecewise` in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`. These spans contain methods like `_eval_subs`, `_eval_power`, and `eval`, which are essential for understanding how substitution and power evaluation are handled in the context of these functions. Additionally, the `_eval_rewrite_as_exp` methods in `sinh` and `cosh` classes could be relevant for understanding how these functions are internally represented and might interact with the `subs` method.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
