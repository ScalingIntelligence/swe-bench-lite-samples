The error seems to be triggered under specific conditions, such as when using `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh`, and happens more frequently with real symbols for `x` and `y`. To investigate this, it's important to look into files and functions related to piecewise expressions, hyperbolic functions, and the `subs()` method to understand how these components interact and potentially where the error originates. Additionally, given the specific conditions mentioned in the issue, it might also be beneficial to check how symbolic assumptions are handled in these contexts.",

The expressions in question are of the form `exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))`. Several conditions and observations are made about when the error occurs and what seems to affect it. The issue appears to be related to the order of assumptions or the specific structure of the expression.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, several key parts of the codebase that deal with substitution (`subs`) and piecewise functions are identified. These areas include implementations of `subs` in classes like `Derivative`, `Piecewise`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `exp`, and others. Each of these classes has a method `_eval_subs` which is responsible for handling substitution. The `Piecewise` class especially is central to the issue as it involves the `Piecewise` function and its interaction with `subs`. The code spans in `Piecewise` show how substitution is handled for piecewise expressions, which is directly relevant to the reported issue.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, the identified code spans in `Piecewise` and other related classes are relevant to understanding or potentially fixing the problem. The implementation of `_eval_subs` in these classes is crucial as it can reveal how substitutions are processed for complex expressions involving piecewise functions.",

I analyzed the provided `Piecewise` class and related methods from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/core/basic.py` to understand how substitutions are handled. Key methods reviewed include `Piecewise.eval`, `Piecewise.doit`, `Piecewise._eval_as_leading_term`, `Piecewise._eval_adjoint`, `Piecewise._eval_conjugate`, `Piecewise._eval_interval`, `Piecewise._eval_nseries`, `Piecewise._eval_power`, and `Piecewise._eval_subs`. These methods are crucial for understanding how substitutions are processed for different expressions like the one reported. In `Piecewise._eval_subs`, it is observed how conditions and expressions are individually replaced, which is essential for understanding the failure to manipulate piecewise functions within specific expressions that lead to the `PolynomialError`. The context also includes snippets of other classes like `Derivative`, `Subs`, `Mul`, `exp`, `Pow`, and `Add` which hint at complex interactions during substitutions. Given the detailed examination, the identification of relevant code spans will focus on `Piecewise._eval_subs` as it directly handles expression substitutions and is likely where the issue manifests.",

The error is observed when substituting integers with floats in expressions involving `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh` with piecewise arguments. The issue seems to be related to assumptions about the symbols and the order of operations in the piecewise function. The provided code snippets from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, `sympy/core/function.py`, `sympy/core/mul.py`, `sympy/core/power.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` contain methods like `_eval_subs`, `_eval_interval`, and `_intervals` which are critical for understanding and resolving the issue. These methods handle substitution, interval evaluation, and interval decomposition for piecewise functions and other expressions. The analysis involves understanding how substitutions in the piecewise function affect the evaluations and how to handle such scenarios to avoid the `PolynomialError`. Additionally, the methods from `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/core/mul.py` provide insights into how derivatives and multiplications are handled with substitution, which could be related to the issue reported regarding assumptions about symbols and the order of operations.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
