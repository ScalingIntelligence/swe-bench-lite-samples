The error seems to be specific to certain combinations and assumptions about the symbols. To debug this, we should focus on the `Piecewise` class and its interaction with other functions like `exp` and `sinh`. Additionally, we should look at the `_eval_subs` method in classes like `Piecewise` and `Pow` to see how substitutions are handled.",

Given this context, I will analyze the provided search results for relevance to the issue, focusing particularly on code spans that deal with `Piecewise` handling, `subs` method implementation, and any relevant conditions or assumptions.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the file `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` contains several relevant spans, particularly those labeled `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise.eval`, `Piecewise._eval_subs`, and `Piecewise._eval_interval`. These spans deal directly with the construction, evaluation, and substitution of `Piecewise` objects, which are central to the reported issue. Additionally, the file `sympy/core/power.py` contains spans labeled `Pow._eval_subs`, which is relevant to understanding how substitutions are handled in expressions involving powers, potentially including those with `Piecewise` components.\n\nGiven these findings, I will select the most directly relevant code spans to include in the response to better understand and potentially debug the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
