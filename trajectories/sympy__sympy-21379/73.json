The error, `PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense`, arises under specific conditions, including the presence of `exp` and `sinh` with piecewise arguments. It's crucial to focus on the `Piecewise` class and its interactions with other functions like `exp` and `sinh`. Additionally, the error is sensitive to the order of assumptions and the presence of certain functions. The search should concentrate on methods related to substitution, evaluation of piecewise functions, and handling of assumptions in expressions.",

The issue hints at a specific type of expression causing a `PolynomialError` when using `subs()`. We should examine the relevant code spans for `Piecewise`, `exp`, and any other functions involved in the expression. Specifically, we need to check if the `subs` method within `Piecewise` handles the substitution correctly, especially when hyperbolic sinusoids and piecewise arguments are involved. Additionally, examining how `exp` and `sinh` handle such arguments and their substitutions could provide more context.\n\nThe search results provide several key spans: `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise.eval`, `Piecewise.doit`, `Piecewise._eval_interval`, `Piecewise._intervals`, `Piecewise._eval_nseries`, `Piecewise._eval_power`, and `Piecewise._eval_subs`. Each of these spans deals with different aspects of the `Piecewise` function, which is central to the issue. We should focus on the `_eval_subs` and `eval` functions as they are directly related to substitution and evaluation, which are critical steps when using `subs()`.\n\nAdditionally, the `exp` class spans such as `exp._eval_rewrite_as_sin`, `exp._eval_rewrite_as_cos`, `exp._eval_rewrite_as_tanh`, `exp._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt`, and `exp._eval_rewrite_as_Pow` might also be relevant if the issue involves transformations or rewrites of exponential expressions. \n\nLastly, across the different files, we see multiple `subs` implementations, which could potentially influence how the substitution process occurs. Checking these to see if they handle the specific expression described in the issue (involving hyperbolic sinusoids and piecewise arguments) correctly is essential.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
