The error is specific to certain functions (like `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`), and certain conditions like the presence of division or the nature of symbol assumptions. Given the context, it's likely that the issue is deep within the handling of these specific functions within the SymPy library. To locate the exact source, it's important to focus on files that deal with functions, substitutions, and specifically, the `Piecewise` class and hyperbolic functions. Various files like `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, `sympy/core/power.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` might be relevant. Additionally, looking into `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` for any simplification logic that might be interfering could be helpful.",

The error specifically mentions `PolynomialError` with the message 'Piecewise generators do not make sense'. Given this context, the most relevant code spans are those related to the `Piecewise` class and its integration, as well as the `subs()` method implementations across different classes that could potentially handle or propagate this error. The analysis of the code spans provided in the search results shows that there are implementations of `subs()` in `Basic`, `MatrixOperations`, `PolyElement`, `FracElement`, and others, which could be relevant. Additionally, the `Piecewise` class itself is important for understanding how this type of expression is managed. The issue's specific conditions also suggest a sensitivity to assumptions about symbol types and perhaps the structure of the expression being handled by these methods. It will be crucial to review entire sections of code where `subs()` and `Piecewise` intersect to ensure completeness in understanding the issue. The provided spans should be sufficient to trace the flow of the `subs()` method through the potential layers of handling with `Piecewise` and to identify where assumptions or conversions might be breaking down.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
