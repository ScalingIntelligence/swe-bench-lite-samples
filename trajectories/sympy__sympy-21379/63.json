The analysis of the provided search results reveals key sections in the codebase that are likely relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py**:\n   - **`Piecewise.__new__`**: This method is responsible for constructing a `Piecewise` object. The error might be related to how conditions and expressions are handled during the object's creation.\n   - **`Piecewise._eval_subs`**: This method handles substitution within a `Piecewise` object. The error could potentially be arising from the substitution logic.\n   - **`Piecewise._eval_interval`**: This method evaluates the `Piecewise` function over a specified interval. If the error is related to how intervals are handled, this method might be relevant.\n\n2. **sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py**:\n   - **`exp._eval_subs`**: This method handles substitution within the exponential function. Since the issue involves expressions with `exp`, this might be relevant to understand how substitutions within these expressions are processed.\n\nThese sections of the code are critical for understanding and potentially resolving the issue, as they directly deal with the operations (like substitution) on the types of expressions mentioned in the issue.\n\nGiven these findings, the next steps would involve a detailed examination of these methods to either confirm or identify the root cause of the `PolynomialError` when using the `subs` method with particular expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids and piecewise arguments.",
