Several conditions need to be considered: the presence of `cosh` or `tanh` instead of `sinh`, the division by `z`, the presence of `exp`, and the assumptions about the symbols being real. Given these conditions, two main areas of focus are the handling of piecewise functions and the substitutions in expressions involving hyperbolic functions. Therefore, the search should concentrate on the methods dealing with these functionalities within Sympy's codebase.",

The primary focus is on identifying the cause of the `PolynomialError` which occurs during substitution, especially with expressions involving `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` functions within piecewise arguments. Through the analysis of the provided search results, I have found several relevant code spans. Firstly, the `Piecewise` class and its `_eval_subs` method in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` are crucial as they handle substitution within piecewise expressions, which is the core of the problem. This method could be where the error originates due to the specific handling of conditions during substitution. Secondly, in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, the `sinh` and `cosh` classes are relevant. Specifically, the `eval` methods for `sinh` and `cosh` are analyzed as they define how these functions evaluate given arguments. This could influence how substitutions affect the piecewise arguments. The issue described mentions the error persisting with `cosh` and `tanh`, and changing behavior with `sinh`, indicating that these evaluations might be key to understanding the bug. Notably, the separation of handling for real and complex arguments in these methods might be related to the specific conditions under which the `PolynomialError` is triggered. The evaluation of piecewise expressions combined with hyperbolic functions' specific behaviors related to argument types seems central to debugging this issue.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
