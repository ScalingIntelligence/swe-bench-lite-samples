The initial code span in `sympy/core/cache.py` shows the `clear_cache` function, which is used in the provided example to clear the cache before operations. This function seems relevant because cache management might be influencing the behavior of `subs()` in some way.\n\nIn `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, there are several relevant code spans dealing with the `exp` class, which includes a `_eval_subs` method. This method is highly relevant because it directly deals with substitution operations, which is at the core of the reported issue. The method handles specific cases of substitution, including when the old expression is of type `Pow` or `S.Exp1`. The presence of `log` class and its related functionalities are also relevant, as `log` operations are part of the expressions used in the issue.\n\nConsidering the detailed descriptions and the functional aspect of the reported issue, these code spans provide a strong starting point for addressing the 'PolynomialError' and understanding the behavior of `subs()` in complex symbolic expressions.\n\nAs such, I identified the following relevant code spans related to the reported issue:",

The `clear_cache()` method in `cache.py` and the hyperbolic functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, etc., in `hyperbolic.py` are central to the issue. Additionally, the `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` file contains code related to the `exp` function, which is also part of the problem expression. The `sympy/polys/polyerrors.py` file is where the `PolynomialError` is defined, which is the error seen in the issue.

Despite the detailed context provided, the precise trigger of the error within these methods remains elusive. The issue seems to be intertwined with how expressions involving hyperbolic functions and piecewise structures are handled during substitution. Additionally, caching mechanisms might play a role, as evident from the handling of `clear_cache`. Since the error is not consistently reproducible and is sensitive to specific conditions, it suggests a deeper, possibly systemic issue within the interaction of these components. Given the provided information and the complexity of the issue, further detailed investigation into the specific interactions between `Piecewise`, `exp`, `sinh`, and caching mechanisms at a more granular level is warranted.",

The search results provided include relevant spans of code from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` where the `Piecewise` class is defined and methods for evaluation and substitution are found. These are directly related to the operations causing the error as described in the issue.

The analysis focuses on identifying code spans that handle substitution, evaluation of piecewise functions, and the specific error handling.

Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
