The error seems to be related to the handling of piecewise functions and their interactions with other functions like `exp` and `sinh`. Given the context and the details provided in the issue, the search should focus on the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` file, where the `Piecewise` class and its methods are defined, and also on the `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` file, which contains the `exp` function that is part of the problematic expression.

Key points from the issue include the specific expression and conditions under which the error arises, and the observations about when the error occurs or doesn't occur (e.g., with `cosh`, `tanh`, `z`, real symbols). The search results include code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`. Relevant code spans could include how `Piecewise` functions are defined and how `subs` is handled in `Piecewise` and `exp` classes. I will identify these code spans and reason about their relevance to the reported issue. Identified code spans will be those that involve the constructors and evaluation methods for `Piecewise`, and methods that handle substitution in `Piecewise` and `exp`.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
