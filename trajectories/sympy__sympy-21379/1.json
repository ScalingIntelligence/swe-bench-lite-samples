The error is specifically traced to the handling of `Piecewise` objects in the `sympy` library. I will analyze the relevant code spans from the `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` files to identify where the error might be occurring and how it can be addressed.\n\nFirst, I will look at the `Piecewise` class and its methods, including `_eval_subs`, `_eval_interval`, and `eval` which are likely candidates for causing the `PolynomialError` when substitutions are made on expressions containing `Piecewise`. Then, I will examine the handling of `sinh` and related functions in `hyperbolic.py` to see if there are any interactions that could lead to unexpected errors when used within `Piecewise` expressions.\n\nBased on the issue description, the error is triggered by specific conditions and elements within the expressions, such as using `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh` with `Piecewise`, and specific assumptions about the symbols' types. Therefore, understanding the interaction between these components in the provided code spans is crucial for identifying the relevant code.\n\nFrom the provided code, the `Piecewise._eval_subs` method is particularly relevant as it handles substitutions, which is directly related to the operation that fails in the user's example. Additionally, the `Piecewise.eval` method is relevant for understanding how `Piecewise` expressions are evaluated and simplified, which could point to underlying issues that lead to the error during substitution.\n\nIn `hyperbolic.py`, the `sinh` class and its methods are relevant as they are the functions mentioned in the user's expression where the error occurs. Specifically, the `_eval_is_real`, `_eval_is_positive`, `_eval_is_negative`, and `_eval_is_zero` methods could be involved in type handling and assumptions about the function's arguments, which might interact with `Piecewise` in problematic ways.",

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
