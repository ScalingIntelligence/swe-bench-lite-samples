The key problem is an unexpected `PolynomialError` when applying `subs` to specific expressions. The search results show multiple implementations of the `subs` method in various SymPy classes, which are relevant to the reported issue. Specifically, `sympy/core/basic.py` has a detailed implementation of the `subs` method for the `Basic` class, which is a fundamental class in SymPy. This implementation involves handling substitutions in a systematic way, including handling simultaneous substitutions and dealing with unordered sequences. This is likely where the issue lies, as it involves complex handling of expressions like those containing hyperbolic functions and piecewise arguments. Other classes like `MatrixOperations`, `Dyadic`, `Vector`, `FracElement`, `PolyElement`, `DiophantineSolutionSet`, `Quaternion`, `Pow`, `ExpBase`, `HadamardPower`, `MatPow`, `MatrixBase`, `LaTeXParser`, `TensorPowerHilbertSpace`, and `OmegaPower` also implement `subs`, which could be relevant for understanding the issue. However, the detailed implementation in `Basic` is the most pertinent as it deals with the fundamental expression handling in SymPy. The `exp` and `sinh` methods found in various classes are also relevant as they pertain to the hyperbolic functions involved in the expressions.",

It specifically mentions encountering a `PolynomialError` when using `subs` in certain conditions. The issue also provides a Minimum Working Example (MWE) that reproduces the error.\n\nStep 2: Review the current file context.\nThe file context includes implementations of the `subs` method in various classes such as `Basic`, `MatrixOperations`, `Dyadic`, `Vector`, `FracElement`, `PolyElement`, and others. It also includes implementations of the `exp` method in classes like `Quaternion`, `Pow`, `ExpBase`, and `MatrixBase`.\n\nStep 3: Process new search results.\n3.1. Analyze the code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`.\n- The `Piecewise` class has methods `_eval_interval`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_power`, and `_eval_subs`, which could be relevant for handling substitutions and piecewise expressions.\n- The `piecewise_fold` function involves logic for folding expressions containing `Piecewise` functions, which might be pertinent for combining multiple piecewise conditions.\n3.2. Analyze the code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`.\n- The `exp` class has methods for evaluating rewrites in terms of trigonometric functions (`_eval_rewrite_as_sin`, `_eval_rewrite_as_cos`), hyperbolic tangent (`_eval_rewrite_as_tanh`), and power (`_eval_rewrite_as_Pow`). These might not be directly relevant to the `subs` issue but could be helpful for understanding the exponential component of the expressions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans appear to be in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, particularly the `Piecewise` class methods like `_eval_interval`, `_eval_subs`, and the `piecewise_fold` function.

However, none of these files directly address the expression involving `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `sinh` together that leads to `PolynomialError`.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
