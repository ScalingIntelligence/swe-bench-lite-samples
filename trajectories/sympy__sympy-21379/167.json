The error is context-sensitive and disappears under certain conditions, such as not clearing the cache or changing the trigonometric function used.

To pinpoint the issue, we should focus on files related to expression substitution, hyperbolic functions, and piecewise functions.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves unexpected behavior when using the `subs` method for expressions containing hyperbolic functions, specifically with piecewise arguments. The `PolynomialError` occurs when certain conditions are met, such as using `cosh` or `tanh` instead of `sinh`, dividing by `z`, or using real symbols for `x` and `y`. \n\nTo identify relevant code spans, I focused on functions and classes related to `Piecewise`, `subs`, and hyperbolic functions (`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`). The code spans for `Piecewise` and its evaluation method, as well as the `Basic.subs` method, are crucial because they can affect how substitutions are handled and may relate to the error. The evaluation methods for hyperbolic functions (`sinh.eval`, `cosh.eval`, `tanh.eval`) are also relevant as they determine how these functions behave within the context of the expressions. \n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans to investigate further include:\n- The entire `Piecewise` class and its `eval` method.\n- The `Basic.subs` method, which handles the substitution process for expressions, and could be the source of the error when dealing with complex expressions.\n- The evaluation methods for hyperbolic functions: `sinh.eval`, `cosh.eval`, and `tanh.eval`, as they handle the computation of these functions and could introduce errors when nested within complex expressions like the ones involving piecewise functions.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue and the error's specific conditions, understanding the interaction between `Piecewise`, hyperbolic functions, and the `subs` method is essential.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
