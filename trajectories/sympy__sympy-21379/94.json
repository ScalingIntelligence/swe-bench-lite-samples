The error seems to be triggered by specific combinations and assumptions of symbols. To debug this, focus on investigating the `subs()` method implementation in relation to the classes `HyperbolicFunction`, `Piecewise`, and `Expr` since these are central to the expressions in question. Additionally, examine assumptions handling in symbol definitions and any related functions that interact with these expressions.",

The file context provided includes definitions from `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, which are relevant to the issue as they include the `HyperbolicFunction` and `Piecewise` classes. The `Piecewise` class's `__new__`, `eval`, and `_eval_subs` methods, among others, are particularly relevant as they handle the substitution and evaluation of piecewise functions. These methods are likely where the error could be arising, especially when dealing with complex expressions involving assumptions on symbols.

The analysis of the issue reveals several key points: the error is specific to certain hyperbolic functions like `cosh` and `tanh`, it disappears under specific conditions (e.g., without division by `z`, without `exp`), and it occurs with real symbols for `x` and `y`. Given these insights, I need to identify code spans in the provided search results that are relevant to handling these specific conditions and involved in the `subs` method for expressions involving `Piecewise` and hyperbolic functions. The search results include spans from `piecewise.py`, `hyperbolic.py`, and `expr.py`, which contain various methods like `__new__`, `eval`, `doit`, `_eval_subs`, `_eval_interval`, and more, that are potentially involved in the processing of such expressions. Specifically, the `Piecewise._eval_subs` span is crucial as it directly handles substitutions, which is the core operation failing in the reported issue.",
