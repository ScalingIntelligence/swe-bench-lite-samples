Given the nature of the error and the specific conditions under which it occurs - particularly with `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, division by `z`, and `exp` - it suggests a deeper issue with how Sympy handles these combinations, potentially related to assumptions or assumptions handling. The key files identified as relevant from the context might be `piecewise.py`, `power.py`, and `exponential.py` due to their direct relevance to the expression types and operations involved. However, further investigation into other files that handle combinations of these functions and piecewise expressions is necessary.",
