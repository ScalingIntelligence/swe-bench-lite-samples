The error is observed when certain conditions are met, such as specific combinations of functions (e.g., `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`), the presence of division by `z`, and the use of real symbols for `x` and `y`. The provided code spans from the `sympy` library help identify relevant parts of the codebase, including the `Piecewise` class and its `_eval_subs` method, which is likely involved in handling substitutions. Additionally, the `Pow` class and its `_eval_subs` method are relevant, as well as the `exp` class handling exponential functions. These classes and their methods are central to evaluating and substituting expressions, making them crucial for solving the reported issue. Furthermore, the `SubstForHyperbolic` function from `utility_function.py` is potentially relevant for handling substitutions involving hyperbolic functions. These code spans are selected based on their direct relevance to the `subs()` method and handling of expressions involving hyperbolic functions and piecewise arguments, which are key elements mentioned in the reported issue.",

These files contain implementations of `Piecewise`, `Pow`, and `exp` classes, respectively, with their `_eval_subs` methods.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n3.1 - Analyzing each code span in the new search results:\n  - `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` contains additional implementations related to `exp` and `log` functions, including the `_eval_subs` method for `exp`.\n  - `sympy/integrals/rubi/utility_function.py` contains utility functions like `Simplify`, `Head`, `ReplaceAll`, `TrigExpand`, `SubstForHyperbolic`, and others that might be relevant for handling substitutions and simplifying expressions.\n\n3.2 - Matching code spans with key elements from the reported issue:\n  - The `PolynomialError` might be related to the handling of `Piecewise` functions and their substitutions. The `_eval_subs` methods in `Piecewise`, `Pow`, and `exp` are critical for understanding and resolving this issue.\n  - The utility functions like `SubstForHyperbolic` and `TrigExpand` in `utility_function.py` can be useful for transforming and simplifying expressions involving hyperbolic functions.\n\n3.3 - Evaluating relevance based on alignment with the reported issue:\n  - The `_eval_subs` methods are directly relevant as they handle the substitution behavior.\n  - Utility functions like `SubstForHyperbolic` and `TrigExpand` are indirectly relevant as they can assist in transforming and simplifying expressions.\n\n3.7 - Identifying relevant code spans:\n  - Relevant spans include the `_eval_subs` methods in `Piecewise`, `Pow`, and `exp`, as well as the utility functions in `utility_function.py`.\n\n4.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
