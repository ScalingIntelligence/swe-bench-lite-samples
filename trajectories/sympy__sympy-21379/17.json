These methods are critical for understanding how substitutions are handled within complex expressions. \n\nIn `Piecewise`, the `_eval_subs` method handles substitutions within the context of piecewise functions, which is directly relevant to the issue. The method iterates over each condition and expression in the piecewise function, applying substitutions. This directly addresses the expression from the reported issue.\n\nIn `Pow`, the `_eval_subs` method deals with substitutions in power expressions, which is also relevant given the use of `exp` (exponential function) in the issue. The method includes checks and conditions that handle the substitution of base and exponent expressions appropriately.\n\nIn `exp`, the `_eval_subs` method focuses on substituting exponential expressions, which is particularly relevant to the issue due to the use of `exp` in the expression. The method includes logic to handle substitutions in the exponent of the exponential function.\n\nGiven the focus of the issue on the behavior of `subs()` for expressions involving piecewise, power, and exponential functions, these three methods in the provided search results are directly relevant.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
