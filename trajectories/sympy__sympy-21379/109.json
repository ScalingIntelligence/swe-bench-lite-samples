The error specifically mentions 'PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense', which indicates a problem with how piecewise functions are being processed. Given the constraints and behavior described, it suggests issues with the interaction between symbolic manipulations and the assumptions about symbol types (real vs non-real). The focus should be on the Piecewise class and its interactions with other functions like exp, sinh, cosh, and tanh, particularly in the context of substitution and symbolic computation. Additionally, the cache management (`clear_cache()`) might be influencing the behavior, indicating a potential side-effect or state-related bug.",

            "scratch_pad": "1. The reported issue involves unexpected behavior with the `subs()` method in SymPy, specifically when dealing with expressions involving hyperbolic functions like `sinh` with piecewise arguments. The issue manifests as a `PolynomialError` and seems to be triggered under specific conditions related to the structure of the expression and the assumptions about the symbols.\n2. Given the nature of the issue, it's crucial to examine the implementations of the hyperbolic functions and the handling of piecewise arguments within these functions. The search results provide insights into the implementation of `sinh` and related functions in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`.\n3. The relevant code spans include the `sinh` class and its methods such as `_eval_rewrite_as_tractable`, `_eval_rewrite_as_cosh`, `_eval_rewrite_as_coth`, and others. These methods are likely places where the piecewise argument might interact with the hyperbolic function, potentially leading to the observed error.\n4. Additionally, the `clear_cache` function in `sympy/core/cache.py` is relevant as the user mentions clearing the cache in their example, suggesting that caching might be a factor in the issue.\n5. By focusing on these code spans, we can better understand how the piecewise argument is processed within the `sinh` function and how caching might affect the behavior.\n6. Overall, these identified spans provide a good starting point for further debugging and understanding the root cause of the `PolynomialError`.",

The error specifically arises when applying `subs` to expressions like `exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))` with certain conditions, such as real symbols for `x` and `y`. The error does not occur with complex symbols or when clear_cache is not invoked. Reviewing the provided search results, the focus should be on the `Piecewise` class and its interactions, particularly in the context of handling `subs` operations with real symbols. The search results include relevant spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` dealing with evaluation, handling conditions, and simplification of `Piecewise` expressions. Thus, these sections are critical for understanding and potentially resolving the issue. Additionally, considering the context of `clear_cache`, it is important to ensure that the cache handling does not interfere with the evaluation of `Piecewise` expressions, especially those involving real symbols and hyperbolic functions. Therefore, the identified spans related to `Piecewise` and cache handling should be analyzed in detail to address the reported issue effectively.",

For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
