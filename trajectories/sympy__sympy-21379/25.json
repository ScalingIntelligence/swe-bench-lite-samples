The error is tied to specific conditions and assumptions about the symbols. Given the context, it's crucial to focus on the implementation of `subs()` in classes handling hyperbolic functions, piecewise expressions, and symbol assumptions. Additionally, the involvement of `exp` and `exp_polar` classes could be significant due to their role in the expression. To effectively debug this, we should look into the methods handling substitutions, specifically those within `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `exp_polar` classes, as well as any utility functions or evaluators that might influence the substitution behavior.",

The error is tied to specific conditions and assumptions about the symbols. Given the context, it's crucial to focus on the implementation of `subs()` in classes handling hyperbolic functions, piecewise expressions, and symbol assumptions. Additionally, the involvement of `exp` and `exp_polar` classes could be significant due to their role in the expression. To effectively debug this, we should look into the methods handling substitutions, specifically those within `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `exp_polar` classes, as well as any utility functions or evaluators that might influence the substitution behavior. The provided file context includes relevant implementations for `Piecewise`, `Derivative`, `Subs`, `Pow`, `Symbol`, `Mul`, and `Add` classes. These implementations cover the methods where substitutions are handled, including `_eval_subs`. The methods within `Piecewise` and other classes show how substitutions are processed, taking into account various conditions and assumptions, which could be relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, the file context appears to cover the necessary parts of the codebase to address the reported issue.",

For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
