The issue describes unexpected behavior when using the `subs()` method with expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids and piecewise arguments, leading to a `PolynomialError`. The search results include code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`. The `Piecewise` class in `piecewise.py` is highly relevant as it deals directly with piecewise functions, which are central to the user's issue. Key methods in this class that are potentially involved in the error are `__new__`, `eval`, `doit`, and `_eval_subs`. These handle the creation, evaluation, and substitution of piecewise expressions. In `exponential.py`, the `exp` class and its methods like `_eval_subs` and `eval` are relevant for handling the `exp` function used in the user's expression. These methods are responsible for evaluating and substituting expressions involving the exponential function. Therefore, these code spans should be considered relevant to the reported issue.",
