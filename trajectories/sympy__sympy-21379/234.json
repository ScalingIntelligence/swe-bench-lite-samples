This suggests that the issue might be either deeply nested within the codebase or requires a more nuanced search strategy. Given the complexity of the issue and the fact that the `PolynomialError` arises under specific conditions related to assumptions about symbols and caching, we may need to investigate deeper into how assumptions and caching mechanisms interact with `subs()` operations in mathematical expressions.

Key aspects of the issue include the behavior of `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` functions within such expressions and the effect of symbol assumptions. From the search results, several files and methods are relevant: \n1. **sympy/core/symbol.py**: This file contains the `Symbol` class with methods like `_eval_subs`, `__new__`, and `_sanitize`. The `_sanitize` method is particularly relevant as it handles assumptions passed to the Symbol, which could affect how `subs` works.\n2. **sympy/core/basic.py**: Contains the `Basic` class with a `_eval_subs` method, which is a base method for `subs` functionality.\n3. **sympy/core/function.py**: Contains classes like `Derivative` and `Subs` with `_eval_subs` methods, relevant for understanding how substitutions work in functions.\n4. **sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py**: Here, the `exp` class has a `_eval_subs` method, which is crucial for expressions involving exponential functions, as in the reported issue.\n5. **sympy/sets/conditionset.py**: The `ConditionSet` class with `_eval_subs` could impact how piecewise functions are handled in substitutions.\n\nFocusing on these files and their `_eval_subs` methods provides a good starting point for understanding and potentially resolving the issue related to unexpected `PolynomialError` during substitutions.",

Basic class in sympy/core/basic.py: As the base class for many SymPy objects, 'Basic' provides a default implementation for `_eval_subs` that returns None, suggesting that derived classes like `Expr` will need to override this to provide specific substitution logic.\n\n3. Function classes like Derivative and Subs in sympy/core/function.py: These handle advanced functionalities and might play a role in how substitutions are processed, especially in mathematical expressions with differentiation.\n\n4. exp class in sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py: This class directly handles the exponential function and its properties. The `_eval_subs` method is tailored to handle substitutions specific to exponential functions, indicating a potential area where the `PolynomialError` might arise based on certain substitutions involving exponents and logarithms.\n\n5. ConditionSet class in sympy/sets/conditionset.py: This class manages sets defined by conditional statements, and its `_eval_subs` method might interact with the assumptions system when performing substitutions, making it a relevant area to examine in the context of errors tied to assumptions and `subs()`.\n\nBuilding on this, the next search should focus on methods in these class files that directly interact with assumptions, particularly those that handle the Piecewise and exp classes, to discern how assumptions and caching might influence the substitution process and potentially lead to the observed `PolynomialError`.",

The `PolynomialError` occurs when specific conditions are met, such as using real symbols for `x` and `y` but not for `z`, and when using certain functions or removing divisions or exponents. From the provided code spans, the focus should be on the `_eval_subs` methods in `sympy.functions.elementary.exponential.exp`, `sympy.functions.elementary.piecewise.Piecewise`, and `sympy.core.function.Derivative` which are critical for handling substitution behavior with expressions like the ones mentioned. These methods should be examined to ensure they correctly manage the substitution of such expressions, particularly when dealing with piecewise conditions and hyperbolic functions. Reviewing these methods in conjunction with the reported issue can help identify if there's a specific scenario where the substitution logic fails or if additional checks are needed to handle expressions with piecewise arguments more robustly.",

Symbol class in sympy/core/symbol.py: This class is crucial as it defines how symbols are created and how their assumptions influence their behavior. The `_sanitize` method ensures that assumptions are appropriately set, and `_eval_subs` is overridden here, indicating potential custom behavior during substitution.2. Basic class in sympy/core/basic.py: As the base class for many SymPy objects, 'Basic' provides a default implementation for `_eval_subs` that returns None, suggesting that derived classes like `Expr` will need to override this to provide specific substitution logic.3. Function classes like Derivative and Subs in sympy/core/function.py: These handle advanced functionalities and might play a role in how substitutions are processed, especially in mathematical expressions with differentiation.4. exp class in sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py: This class directly handles the exponential function and its properties. The `_eval_subs` method is tailored to handle substitutions specific to exponential functions, indicating a potential area where the `PolynomialError` might arise based on certain substitutions involving exponents and logarithms.5. ConditionSet class in sympy/sets/conditionset.py: This class manages sets defined by conditional statements, and its `_eval_subs` method might interact with the assumptions system when performing substitutions, making it a relevant area to examine in the context of errors tied to assumptions and `subs()`. Building on this, the next search should focus on methods in these class files that directly interact with assumptions, particularly those that handle the Piecewise and exp classes, to discern how assumptions and caching might influence the substitution process and potentially lead to the observed `PolynomialError`.",

The issue is specific to substitutions within these expressions, and detailed conditions trigger the error. Reviewing the provided code spans in `<file_context>`, key sections such as `Symbol._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/symbol.py`, `Basic._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/basic.py`, and `exp._eval_subs` in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` seem relevant to substitutions. Specifically, `Piecewise._eval_subs` in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` is crucial as the error involves piecewise functions. The new search results confirm the relevance of `Piecewise` class and its `_eval_subs` method. This method's handling of substitutions within piecewise functions, especially considering the conditions under which false conditions are not skipped appropriately, relates directly to the issue. Therefore, this method is confirmed as a critical point of analysis. Similarly, the `exp._eval_subs` method in the `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` file and `Subs._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/function.py` also pertain to the handling of substitutions in expressions involving exponentials and substitutions in general, which are pertinent to the case.

These components play a crucial role in the `subs()` operation, which is central to the reported issue. \n\nFrom the context, the `Symbol` class is particularly notable as it manages the creation of symbols along with their assumptions, using the `_sanitize` method. This method ensures that the assumptions are correctly set, affecting how symbols behave during operations like substitution. Thus, anomalies in assumption handling could lead to unexpected errors such as the `PolynomialError` during substitutions.\n\nAdditionally, the `_eval_subs` methods in classes like `Basic`, `Derivative`, `exp`, `ConditionSet`, and `Piecewise` provide custom logic for performing substitutions. These methods are critical because they determine how and under what conditions substitutions are applied, which is directly related to the reported issue where substitutions lead to an unexpected error. \n\nRegarding caching, while not explicitly visible in the provided context, the `_eval_subs` methods within these classes would interact with the caching system, influencing how expressions are stored and retrieved, which could affect the stability and correctness of the substitution process.\n\nGiven these insights, the search should focus on exploring how assumptions and caching influence the behavior of these `_eval_subs` methods, especially in the context of complex expressions involving `Piecewise` and `exp` classes. This will help in pinpointing the exact conditions or interactions that result in the `PolynomialError`, leading to a resolution of the reported issue.",

The focus should therefore be on identifying code spans related to the `Piecewise` class and its interaction with the `subs()` method, as well as any assumptions handling in symbol definitions that might influence this behavior. The given search results prominently feature the `Piecewise` class and its methods, especially `_eval_subs`, which directly relates to substitution behavior.

You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
