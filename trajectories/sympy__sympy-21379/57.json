Based on the issue description and the provided context, it's clear that the problem is related to the interaction between `Piecewise` and `subs`, particularly when dealing with expressions inside functions like `exp` and `sinh`. The search should focus on the `sympy/core/` and `sympy/functions/elementary/` directories, specifically looking for mentions of `Piecewise`, `subs`, and the hyperbolic functions in question. Additionally, the `_eval_subs` method and the handling of piecewise arguments should be investigated.",

Specifically, the `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise.eval`, `Piecewise._eval_subs`, and `Piecewise._eval_interval` methods seem particularly relevant as they deal with the construction, evaluation, and substitution of `Piecewise` objects. Additionally, the `Piecewise._intervals` method, which deals with interval handling for `Piecewise` expressions, could also be pertinent. These sections of the code are critical for understanding how piecewise expressions are managed and how substitutions might interact with these conditions, which could be causing the `PolynomialError`.
