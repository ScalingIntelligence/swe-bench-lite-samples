The expressions triggering the `PolynomialError` involve `exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))`. The analysis of the issue suggests that the error is sensitive to the specific components of the expression (such as the presence of `exp`, `sinh`, or division by `z`) and the assumptions about the symbols (`x` and `y` being real). The search results focus on the `exponential.py` file, which contains the definitions for the `exp` and `log` functions in SymPy. The `_eval_subs` method in the `exp` class is particularly relevant as it handles substitution logic, which is central to the issue reported. The presence of logic specific to handling `Pow`, `S.Exp1`, and other related functions within `_eval_subs` indicates that the method is designed to manage complex substitutions, potentially including those involving piecewise functions and hyperbolic functions. This makes the `_eval_subs` method a prime candidate to investigate further in relation to the reported issue.",

Key elements from the issue include the presence of `exp`, `sinh`, `Piecewise`, and the specific error message 'PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense'. The current file context involves code spans related to `exp` and `log` functions in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, which are relevant to the expressions in the issue. The new search results provide code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, which contains the `Piecewise` class and its methods. These methods are critical for understanding how `Piecewise` expressions are handled and could be related to the error. Specifically, the `Piecewise._eval_subs` method and the `Piecewise.__new__` method, which handles the creation and evaluation of `Piecewise` objects, are identified as relevant. Additionally, the `Piecewise.eval` method, which evaluates the `Piecewise` object, and the `Piecewise._handle_irel` method, which handles relational expressions, are also relevant as they directly deal with the conditions and expressions that could lead to the error. Overall, the identified code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` are crucial for investigating the cause of the `PolynomialError` described in the issue.",

The method also ensures that if a condition becomes `False` after substitution, it skips that pair, and if a condition becomes `True`, it stops further evaluation. This behavior could potentially lead to the `PolynomialError` if the internal logic for handling piecewise expressions during substitution doesn't account for all possible forms of the expression, such as those involving `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh` with piecewise arguments.

The user has identified specific conditions under which the `PolynomialError` arises, such as using `cosh` or `tanh` instead of `sinh`, removing the division by `z`, or using real symbols for `x` and `y`. The search results include various code spans from different files that define or manipulate hyperbolic functions, exponential functions, piecewise functions, and their respective subs methods. Key sections to focus on would be the `_eval_subs` methods in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, as these are directly related to the handling of substitutions in expressions involving `sinh`, `exp`, and `Piecewise`. It's important to ensure that these methods correctly handle the specific types of expressions and assumptions that lead to the PolynomialError. Additionally, examining how these methods interact with each other when an expression contains both hyperbolic functions and piecewise parts could help in identifying the root cause of the issue.",

Additionally, the `exp` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` handles substitutions differently based on the type of the `old` argument, suggesting a complex interplay during substitutions. The file context also includes the hyperbolic function classes (`sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`) in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, which are directly involved in the expressions causing the error.

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
