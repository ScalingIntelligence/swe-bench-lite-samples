The error is sensitive to the structure of the expression and the assumptions about the symbols. Given the detailed context provided in the issue, it's essential to focus on areas in the codebase where substitutions, hyperbolic functions, and piecewise expressions are handled. The provided files hint at potential points of intervention, especially those dealing with substitutions, piecewise evaluation, and hyperbolic function manipulations. Specific functions to look for include `_eval_subs`, `SubstForHyperbolic`, and methods related to handling `Piecewise` expressions.",

From the search results, several relevant code spans are identified: \n1. In `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, the `HyperbolicFunction` class and its subclasses (like `sinh`) are relevant because they define the behavior of hyperbolic functions.\n2. In `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Subs` class and its methods are relevant because they handle substitution, which is a key part of the reported issue.\n3. In `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, the `Piecewise` class and its methods are relevant because they define the behavior of piecewise functions, which are also part of the reported issue.\nGiven these code spans, it seems that the search results include classes and methods that are directly involved in the reported issue.

The `Symbol` class from `sympy/core/symbol.py` is also included, though its relevance to the specific issue is less direct compared to the hyperbolic and piecewise functions.

When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
