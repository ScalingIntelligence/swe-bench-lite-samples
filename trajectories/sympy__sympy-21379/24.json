Key factors seem to be the use of real symbols and the presence of certain functions or operations in the expression. To pinpoint the root cause, it's crucial to focus on the interaction between these components, particularly in the `subs` method. It's also important to note that the error interacts with caching mechanisms, suggesting potential internal state issues. Therefore, the search should concentrate on methods and classes related to `Piecewise`, `sinh`, `exp`, and their interactions in the context of substitutions and assumptions.",

The error observed is a `PolynomialError` specifically when using `cosh` or `tanh` within the expression, and when `x` and `y` are real symbols. The analysis of search results should start with the `Piecewise` class since pieces with boolean conditions define a piecewise function. Other classes involved in the expression, like `exp` and `sinh`, are also import as they change behavior with `subs` and implementations involving real symbols. \n\nGiven the issue's focus on expressions with `sinh`, `exp`, and `Piecewise` functions, the relevant code spans include the `subs` methods of `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `sinh` functions. Additionally, since the issue arises with real symbols implying some underlying assumptions about the domain, the evaluation methods could influence where an error is raised, including code spans for 'eval' in `Piecewise` and in `sinh`. Considering the complexity of the bug, realizing the mode of failure in implementing numerical consults with a combination of expressions containing at least one `Piecewise` object could help pinpoint relevant code spans. \n\nTo disproportionally include code spans from `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `sinh` due to their critical nature in triggering error- and the major hypotheses suggests assessing how assumed limitations on the 'domain' handle handling `subs`.",

The user has provided specific conditions under which the error arises and several observations that might help in understanding the root cause. Initially, it appears the issue might be related to the interplay between assumptions and the evaluation of piecewise expressions. Based on this, my analysis will focus on the `Piecewise` class and its interaction with hyperbolic functions as detailed in the received context files. So far, the identified relevant parts of the code include the `Piecewise._eval_subs` method and the `sinh.eval` method. The new search results should further elucidate on how assumptions and specific parameters within the expression might be influencing the behavior.As a result of analyzing the previously provided context files and the new search results, it's evident that the `exp._eval_subs` method and the handling of substitutions within the `Pow` class might also be crucial to resolving the issue. These methods, along with the previously identified methods from the `Piecewise` class in `piecewise.py`, form the core components for understanding and potentially fixing the reported issue. Further scrutiny on how substitution is handled in `exp` and `Pow`, along with ensuring that piecewise expressions evaluate correctly when subjected to substitutions, should be the focus of further investigation.",

The error is triggered under specific conditions related to the order of assumptions in the expression. The issue appears to be linked to the handling of Piecewise functions and their interaction with other elements like `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh` within the `sympy` library.\n\nThe current file context has identified relevant code spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, focusing on the `_eval_subs` method in both `Piecewise` and `exp` classes, which are crucial for understanding how substitutions are handled. Additionally, the `sinh` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` has also been examined for its role in evaluating the hyperbolic sinusoid.\n\nNew search results provide further insights into the `Pow` class from `sympy/core/power.py`, specifically the `_eval_subs` method, which handles substitutions for powers. This is relevant as the issue involves expressions with complicated power structures and substitutions. The additional context from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` concerning the `Piecewise` class is also informative, particularly the `_eval_subs` method, which processes substitutions for piecewise expressions.\n\nOverall, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of how substitutions are managed within the `sympy` library, relevant to the reported issue.

Additionally, the cache management and assumption systems might play a role in the error, as suggested by the sensitivity to the order of assumptions and caching operations. To delve deeper, it's crucial to find occurrences of `PolynomialError` in the codebase related to these classes and methods.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
