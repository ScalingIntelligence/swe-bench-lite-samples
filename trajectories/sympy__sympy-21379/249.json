The issue seems to be triggered by specific conditions, such as the presence of `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh`, and certain assumptions about the symbols involved. The error is also influenced by the structure of the expression, such as the presence of division or the `exp` function. Given this context, it's important to focus on code spans that are relevant to these conditions and functions. The provided file context and search results include portions of code from `piecewise.py`, `polyerrors.py`, and `hyperbolic.py`. The `piecewise.py` file appears to be the most relevant as it contains definitions for `ExprCondPair` and `Piecewise`, as well as methods like `_eval_subs` which is directly involved in substituting values in expressions, potentially triggering the error. The `polyerrors.py` file defines various polynomial-related errors, including `PolynomialError`, which matches the error type mentioned in the issue. The `hyperbolic.py` file contains definitions for hyperbolic functions like `sinh` and `coth`, which are directly involved in the reported expression. By focusing on these files and key code spans, we can identify the most relevant portions of code to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
