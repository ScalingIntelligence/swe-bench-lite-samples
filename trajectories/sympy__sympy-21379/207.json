            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves an unexpected `PolynomialError` when using `subs()` for expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. The user's minimal working example (MWE) points to specific conditions under which the error arises, such as the presence of `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh` functions within a `Piecewise` structure divided by another variable (`z`). Additionally, the error is influenced by the assumptions about the symbols involved (e.g., real symbols). The search results provide several spans that could be relevant to debugging this issue. Initially, `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` contains spans related to the `Piecewise` class, its instantiation, evaluation, substitution, and handling intervals. These methods deal directly with the behavior and manipulation of `Piecewise` objects, which are central to the user's issue. The `_eval_subs` method is of particular interest as it handles substitution, which is the operation causing the unexpected error in the user's example. Similarly, in `sympy/core/power.py`, the `_eval_subs` method of the `Pow` class is also relevant, as the user's issue involves expressions that potentially involve powers (especially after considering the division by `z` could be interpreted as a power operation). Lastly, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` contains the `_eval_subs` method for the `exp` class. Considering the user's MWE involves `exp(sinh(...))`, this is highly relevant as it directly addresses the core expression from the user's issue. Given the direct connection these spans have to the operations (`subs`, specifically) and components (like `Piecewise`, `exp`, and `Pow`) in the user's MWE, they are likely to contain the code causing or related to the unexpected `PolynomialError`.",

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
