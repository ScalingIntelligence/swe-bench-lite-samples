The error seems to be triggered by specific conditions related to real symbols and certain operations like division or exponentiation. Given the context and the errors encountered, it's likely that the problem lies within the handling of piecewise functions or the interaction between these functions and other operations like exponentials. Search parameters should focus on methods or classes related to piecewise functions, substitution, and hyperbolic functions.",

The error is particularly relevant when handling expressions with `sinh`, `cosh`, or `tanh` in combination with `Piecewise`. From the search results, the most relevant code spans are those that deal with the `Piecewise` class and its methods, especially the `_eval_subs` method which handles substitution. Additionally, the `exp` class's `_eval_subs` method and the `Piecewise._eval_interval` method could also be relevant as they involve operations and conditions related to the piecewise functions and intervals, which might be influencing the error. Understanding how these methods handle substitutions and evaluations can help in debugging and potentially solving the issue.
