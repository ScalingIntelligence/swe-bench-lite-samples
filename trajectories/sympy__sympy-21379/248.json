Key points from the issue indicate that the error arises specifically when combined with certain conditions involving real symbols, specific functions (sinh, cosh, tanh), and certain transformations. The analysis of the search results reveals code spans that are potentially relevant to the issue due to their handling of power operations, substitutions, and evaluation of expressions involving exponentials and logarithmic functions, which are central to the reported problem. Specifically, the `Pow` class methods `_eval_power` and `_eval_subs` appear to deal with the type of operations described in the issue, as they manage the behavior of power expressions under various conditions related to real symbols and substitutions. Similarly, the `exp` class's `_eval_subs` method also deals with substitutions involving exponential functions, which is directly related to the issue. These sections of code are likely to contain the logic that could be causing or interacting with the `PolynomialError` described.",

The search results provide additional context in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`, particularly the `Piecewise` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_interval`. These methods are crucial for understanding how `Piecewise` expressions are handled during substitution and evaluation. Based on the reported issue, the relevant code spans are those that deal with substitutions involving `Piecewise` expressions and handling of conditions within these expressions. This includes the `_eval_subs` method in both `Pow` and `Piecewise`, as well as methods like `_eval_interval` in `Piecewise` that manage conditional evaluations.

Specifically, the code spans `Piecewise.__new__`, `Piecewise._eval_subs`, and `Piecewise._eval_interval` are relevant as they deal with the creation, substitution, and interval evaluation of piecewise functions, respectively. These methods could be the source of the error when dealing with complex expressions involving substitutions and piecewise arguments. Additionally, the `Pow._eval_subs` and `exp._eval_subs` methods from `sympy.core.power` and `sympy.functions.elementary.exponential` modules are also relevant as they handle substitution in power and exponential functions, which are parts of the expressions in question.

  "initial_message": "Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions\nI am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.\r\n\r\nSee the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.\r\n\r\nSympy version: 1.8.dev\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy import *\r\nfrom sympy.core.cache import clear_cache\r\n\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This works fine\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n\r\nclear_cache()\r\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\r\nexpr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))\r\n# This fails with \"PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense\"\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error\r\n# Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error\r\nexpr.subs({1: 1.0})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-\r\n\r\n- The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds\r\n- The error goes away if removing the division by `z`\r\n- The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)\r\n- The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)\r\n\r\nNot too sure how to debug this one.\n"
