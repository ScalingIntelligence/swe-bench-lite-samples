The expected behavior is for the path to remain relative to the original directory. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans, particularly in the 'Testdir' class of 'src/_pytest/pytester.py' and the 'MonkeyPatch' class of 'src/_pytest/monkeypatch.py'. These classes handle directory changes and snapshots, which are directly related to the fixture behavior described in the issue. The 'Testdir' class includes methods for managing the current working directory and creating snapshots, which could potentially be related to the issue. The 'MonkeyPatch' class, which provides methods for changing the directory, might also play a role in the observed behavior. Other spans, such as those related to 'CwdSnapshot' and 'SysPathsSnapshot' in 'src/_pytest/pytester.py', indicate mechanisms for restoring the working directory and system paths, suggesting potential areas where the directory change could be incorrectly managed or restored. Overall, these spans provide a clear starting point for further investigation into the issue.",
