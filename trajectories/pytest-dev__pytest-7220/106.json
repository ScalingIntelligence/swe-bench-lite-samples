For example, in '_pytest/pytester.py', there are spans dealing with creating snapshots of the current working directory and restoring it after tests. Similarly, in '_pytest/monkeypatch.py', there is code for changing the directory using monkeypatch. These spans are relevant because they address the handling of directory changes, which is central to the issue reported. Additionally, the code that deals with snapshots and restoration can be leveraged to ensure the directory is correctly managed during and after test execution, potentially solving the path display issue.
