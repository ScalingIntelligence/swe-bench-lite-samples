The error occurs when the path displayed in the test output is relative to the new directory rather than the original directory. The 'os.chdir' method seems to be the central point of the issue. It is likely that the path reporting mechanism in pytest might not account for such changes in the working directory. To resolve this, we need to identify the part of the code where the paths are being generated or reported and ensure they are relative to the original directory.",
