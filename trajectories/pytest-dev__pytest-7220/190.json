The problem arises when the working directory is changed in a fixture, causing the paths of files to be shown relative to the new directory, which is incorrect. This impacts the developer's ability to jump to errors directly from the editor. The solution requires investigating how directory changes are handled and reflected in the path display within pytest fixtures.",

The issue is that the displayed directory is relative to the new directory, making it impossible to jump to the error as the editor is unaware of the directory change. The expected behavior is for the displayed directory to stay relative to the original directory.\n\nReviewing the search results, there are several relevant code spans that deal with directory changes, fixtures, and pytest configurations.\n\n1. `src/_pytest/pytester.py`: This file contains the `Testdir` class which deals with changing directories and managing temporary directories, which is relevant to the issue.\n2. `testing/python/fixtures.py`: This file contains tests related to fixtures and directory changes, including a test that checks for non-relative paths.\n3. `src/_pytest/python.py`: This file contains pytest configuration options and functions related to displaying fixtures per test, which might be relevant for understanding how paths are displayed.\n\nThese code spans are identified as relevant based on their functionality related to directory changes, fixture management, and pytest configuration options.

The search results include sections of code primarily from two files: 'src/_pytest/pytester.py' and 'testing/python/fixtures.py'. In these files, several methods and classes related to test directory management and fixture handling are found. Specifically, the 'Testdir' class in 'src/_pytest/pytester.py' is relevant as it includes methods for changing directories (`chdir()`) and managing temporary directories (`mktemp()`). Additionally, the 'TestParameterizedSubRequest' class in 'testing/python/fixtures.py' contains test methods that involve changing directories and handling fixtures, which is directly related to the issue at hand. These sections of code are crucial for understanding how the directory change in fixtures is managed and how it could be causing the reported issue.",
