The provided code snippet shows a fixture named 'private_dir' that changes the working directory to 'ddd' and then changes it back after yielding. The expected behavior is that the path displayed should be relative to the original directory, but it is not. The search results include multiple files and spans that could be relevant to fixing this issue. Specifically, the 'pytest_runtest_protocol', 'runtestprotocol', 'call_and_report', and 'SetupState' spans in 'src/_pytest/runner.py' show how pytest handles test setup, execution, and teardown, which could influence how paths are reported. Additionally, the 'pytest_runtest_logstart' and 'pytest_runtest_logfinish' hooks in 'src/_pytest/hookspec.py' could be where the actual logging of test paths takes place. These hooks could be checked or modified to ensure that paths are reported relative to the original directory, not the changed directory. The identified spans are relevant as they deal directly with the pytest hooks and state management that influence how and when test paths are logged and reported.",

However, the code snippet does not explicitly show how paths are managed or reported in the test results after a directory change.
