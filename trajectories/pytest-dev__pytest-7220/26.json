This results in the editor being unaware of the directory change, making it impossible to jump to the error. The goal is to ensure the displayed directory stays relative to the original directory.\n\nThe provided search results include multiple files with code spans that could be relevant:\n\n1. src/_pytest/monkeypatch.py includes the MonkeyPatch class with methods for changing the current working directory (chdir), which aligns with the issue concerning directory changes.\n\n2. src/_pytest/pytester.py includes the Testdir class, which contains a method (chdir) that changes the working directory to the temporary directory created for tests. This could also be relevant as it affects the path handling context during tests.\n\n3. src/_pytest/python.py includes functions related to pytest command line main, fixture display, and paths. This might be indirectly relevant for understanding how paths are displayed and managed during pytest sessions.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that the MonkeyPatch and Testdir classes from the monkeypatch.py and pytester.py files respectively are the most directly relevant to the reported issue. These classes handle directory changes and could be the starting points for addressing the issue of paths updating incorrectly due to directory changes.",
