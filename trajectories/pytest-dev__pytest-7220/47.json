When an assertion fails in such a scenario, the file path displayed in the error message is relative to the new working directory instead of the original one. This makes it difficult for the developer to locate the exact source of the error in their editor. The provided code snippet and stack trace suggest the issue lies in the way pytest handles directory changes within fixtures and how it reports file paths during failures. To resolve this, I need to search for related configurations and functions in pytest that manage directory changes and path reporting.",
