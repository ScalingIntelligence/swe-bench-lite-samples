This affects the ability to jump to the error in the editor. The provided context includes code related to 'monkeypatch' and 'testdir' fixtures which manipulate the working directory. The search results include 'FixtureManager' and 'pytest_sessionstart' which handle fixture management and session start, but do not directly address the issue of maintaining the relative path based on the original directory after a directory change in a fixture. Therefore, while these results offer broader context about the fixture management in pytest, they do not directly resolve the path display issue described.
