The fixture in question is 'private_dir' which changes the working directory to a new directory 'ddd' before yielding and then restoring the original directory after the test. The expected behavior is for the displayed path to remain relative to the original directory, but currently, it is relative to the new directory. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. \n\nThe search results focus on various parts of the pytest framework related to fixtures and directory manipulation. Notably, 'CwdSnapshot' class is a good candidate as it provides a mechanism to save and restore the current working directory, which seems relevant to the issue. Also, 'Testdir' class and its methods might be relevant as it deals with temporary directory manipulation and test execution context. The 'SysPathsSnapshot' and 'SysModulesSnapshot' classes are also considered since they handle system path and module snapshots, which might be indirectly related to the issue if they affect the directory context in some way. \n\nThe identified spans include 'CwdSnapshot.__init__' and 'CwdSnapshot.restore' for their direct relevance to saving and restoring the current working directory. 'Testdir.__init__' and 'Testdir.chdir' are also included as they might set up and change directories in a similar context. 'SysPathsSnapshot.__init__' and 'SysPathsSnapshot.restore' are added with the consideration that they might be influencing directory paths; however, their direct relevance is lower than the previously mentioned spans.",
