The function `_show_fixtures_per_test` is particularly relevant as it deals with displaying test locations and handling fixtures, which could be where the directory change issue manifests. This function uses `curdir.bestrelpath(loc)` to determine the best relative path for a test location. If the current directory has been altered by the fixture, this could explain why the path reported in the error is incorrect. Additionally, the `pytest_cmdline_main` function is also relevant as it is the main entry point for running pytest, which would include handling any directory changes caused by fixtures.
