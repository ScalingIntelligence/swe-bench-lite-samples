This directly relates to managing the working directory context in tests.\n2. The `MonkeyPatch` class and its `chdir` method, which is used for changing the current working directory in a way that can be undone. This is crucial for testing scenarios where the working directory needs to be manipulated.\n3. The `Testdir` class and its `__init__` method, which sets up snapshots of the system paths and modules, and changes the current working directory.
