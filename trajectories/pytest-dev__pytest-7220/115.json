This problem affects the `test_show_wrong_path` function in the `test_path_error.py` file. The goal is to ensure that file paths remain relative to the original directory, which is crucial for maintaining consistent error reporting and navigation in the development environment. To address this, we need to investigate how pytest handles directory changes within fixtures and how it reports file paths. We should focus on the `pytest` module and functions/classes related to directory changing and path reporting.",

The expected behavior is that the path to the test file should remain relative to the original directory, but it is being displayed relative to the new directory.

Specifically, the `Testdir.chdir` method changes the current working directory to the temporary directory, which aligns with the issue of changing directories in the test environment. Given the relevance of directory management in the issue, these `Testdir` class methods (specifically `chdir` and the constructor responsible for setting up the environment) are likely relevant to addressing the issue.

The test_path_error.py file provided demonstrates the problem, where the assertion error path is displayed as '../test_path_error.py' instead of 'test_path_error.py'. This discrepancy is due to the working directory change in the 'private_dir' fixture, which changes the relative path displayed. To address this issue, understanding how directory changes are managed in pytest fixtures and snapshots is crucial. The provided search results include relevant code spans from the '_pytest/pytester.py' file, particularly the 'CwdSnapshot' and 'SysPathsSnapshot' classes, which manage the current working directory and system paths, respectively.
