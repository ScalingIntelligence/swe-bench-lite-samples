The provided context includes the relevant code from src/_pytest/monkeypatch.py, which defines the `monkeypatch` fixture and the `MonkeyPatch` class, particularly focusing on directory change methods (`chdir` and `undo`). New search results introduced in src/_pytest/terminal.py contain a `WarningReport` class with a method `get_location` that seems to compute path relativeness based on `config.invocation_dir`. Given the issue's focus on path relativeness, this method appears highly relevant as it directly relates to how paths are represented after directory change operations.

This directly addresses the directory change mechanism of the issued problem.

However, the exact issue of path relativity after directory change is not directly shown to be handled in the provided context.
