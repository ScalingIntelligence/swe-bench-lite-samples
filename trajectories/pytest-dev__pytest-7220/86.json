To address the issue, we need to introduce a way to capture the original working directory before any changes are made and use this context in path calculations. Given the constraints and the absence of a direct way to integrate `CwdSnapshot` into these functions, I propose a simpler approach to modify the path calculation logic within these functions to ensure paths are relative to the original directory.",
