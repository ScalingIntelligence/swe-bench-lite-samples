This affects the ability to jump to the error in the editor because the directory context is lost. The identified code spans are relevant because they deal with directory changes, fixture handling, and path manipulations within pytest. Notably, the 'pytest_cmdline_main', 'show_fixtures_per_test', and '_show_fixtures_per_test' functions handle the main command line actions and fixture display, which could potentially be adjusted to maintain path context. Additionally, the 'MonkeyPatch.chdir' and 'Testdir.chdir' methods are directly involved in changing the directory context, making them critical for understanding and fixing the issue. The 'pytest_fixture_setup' function is also relevant as it sets up fixtures, which could be where the directory change logic should be adjusted to ensure paths remain relative to the original directory rather than the temporary one. By understanding these parts of the code, we can pinpoint where to address the path display issue.",
