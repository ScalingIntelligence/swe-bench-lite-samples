The main focus is on ensuring that the directory displayed in the error message remains relative to the original directory, not the changed one. The provided search results contain numerous pytest-related fixtures and functions, but the most relevant code spans are those that deal directly with directory changes and fixture management. Specifically, the `private_dir` fixture in the issue example manipulates the working directory, which is likely causing the path discrepancy. The search results include several tests and fixtures that manage directory changes and fixture scope, such as `TestFixtureManagerParseFactories.testdir`, `TestScopeOrdering.test_func_closure_with_native_fixtures`, and the `Testdir` class in `src/_pytest/pytester.py`. These code spans are relevant because they deal with the core issue of directory manipulation during test runs and fixture management, which directly impacts the path presentation in the error message. The `Testdir` class, in particular, is highly relevant as it involves creating and managing temporary directories, which could be linked to the path issues described in the report.",

Specifically, the focus should be on understanding how the current working directory (CWD) is managed during test execution, how paths are constructed and reported, and how these might be affected by changes to the CWD within fixture scopes.",

Specifically, it mentions that files are shown as relative to the new directory after a change in the working directory within a fixture, causing issues with jumping to errors in the editor. The expected behavior is for the displayed directory to remain relative to the original directory.\n\nI need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the change of directory within fixtures and the reporting of test file paths. The search results provide several potential candidates such as the 'TestFixtureManagerParseFactories' class and 'Testdir' fixture in pytester.py, which handle fixture management and directory changes. Additionally, the 'CollectReport' class in reports.py and the 'runtestprotocol' function in runner.py deal with test execution and reporting, which could be relevant to how paths are reported or displayed.\n\nGiven the issue description, the focus should be on code spans that manage directory changes within fixtures and the subsequent reporting of file locations.",
