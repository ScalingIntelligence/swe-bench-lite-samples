This suggests that `curdir` is intended to represent the original directory context from which the tests were initiated. However, if a fixture like `private_dir` changes the working directory during its execution, it could lead to a mismatch between the actual current directory and the `curdir` value. This discrepancy can cause paths to be shown incorrectly.
