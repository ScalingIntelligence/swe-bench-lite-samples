The expected behavior is that the displayed path should remain relative to the original directory, but it currently shows relative to the new directory. This makes it impossible to jump to the error in the editor.\n\n2. Reviewing the current file context: No relevant code has been identified yet.\n\n3. Processing new search results:\n   - In src/_pytest/pytester.py: The `Testdir` class and its `chdir` method are relevant as they handle directory changes. The `_makefile` method is also relevant as it deals with file paths.\n   - In src/_pytest/python.py: The `_show_fixtures_per_test` function is relevant as it deals with fixture information and paths. The `get_best_relpath` function is particularly relevant as it calculates relative paths.\n   - In src/_pytest/fixtures.py: The `FixtureRequest` class and its `_getnextfixturedef` method are relevant as they handle fixture requests and could potentially affect path handling. The `get_scope_package` function is also relevant as it deals with scope and paths.\n\nThese code spans are likely to be involved in the path calculation or directory change handling, which is directly related to the reported issue.\n\n4.

This should be sufficient to understand and potentially address the reported issue regarding incorrect path display.",

In the 'Testdir' class, there is a method named 'chdir()' which changes the directory, relevant to the issue described. Additionally, the 'FixtureRequest' class in 'src/_pytest/fixtures.py' is also related as it handles fixture requests, and the context includes methods for handling fixture definitions and scope. The context also includes parts of 'src/_pytest/python.py' which deals with showing fixtures per test, which might be connected to how paths are displayed during test execution.

The expected behavior is for paths to remain relative to the original directory, but they are being displayed relative to the new directory. This makes it difficult to jump to the error in the editor.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, several relevant code spans can be identified:\n\n1. **Testdir Class**: This class is used to create a temporary directory for testing and change the working directory to it. The `chdir` method in `Testdir` explicitly changes the directory, which is likely related to the reported issue.\n\n2. **FixtureRequest and SubRequest Classes**: These classes manage the fixture requests and their lifecycle, including setting up and tearing down fixtures. The `_get_fixturestack` and `_compute_fixture_value` methods in `FixtureRequest` are relevant as they handle different aspects of fixture management.\n\n3. **show_fixtures_per_test and _show_fixtures_per_test Functions**: These functions deal with displaying fixtures used by tests and their paths. The `get_best_relpath` function used within `_show_fixtures_per_test` is particularly relevant as it determines the relative paths for fixtures, which should be relative to the original directory but might be affected by the directory change.\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant code spans from the search results align closely with the reported issue, particularly the parts dealing with directory management and fixture path display. Therefore, the search can be considered complete in the provided context.",

The key elements to focus on are the fixture definition and the way the working directory is managed. In the provided context and search results, there are relevant spans that handle directory changes and fixture management. Specifically, the 'private_dir' fixture in the issue description demonstrates changing the working directory, and the search results contain spans from '_pytest/pytester.py', '_pytest/python.py', and '_pytest/fixtures.py' that deal with directory changes and fixture handling. The 'Testdir' class in '_pytest/pytester.py' appears particularly relevant, as it manages test directories and includes methods for changing directories ('chdir') and handling fixtures. Similarly, the 'FixtureRequest' and 'SubRequest' classes in '_pytest/fixtures.py' manage fixture requests and could potentially have methods affecting the directory context.
