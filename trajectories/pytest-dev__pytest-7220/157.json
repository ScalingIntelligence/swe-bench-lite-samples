The problem is that when the working directory is changed in the fixture, the paths for test files become relative to the new directory, causing confusion and making it difficult to jump to errors in the editor. To address this, we should focus on the `private_dir` fixture implementation and any related functions or configuration settings in pytest that handle directory changes and path reporting.",
