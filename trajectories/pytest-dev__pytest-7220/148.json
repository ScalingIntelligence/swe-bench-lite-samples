In `_pytest/monkeypatch.py`, the `MonkeyPatch` class has a method `chdir` which suggests it is involved in changing directories, fitting the issue description where directory change seems to be the core problem. Similarly, `_pytest/pytester.py` has a `Testdir` class with methods `chdir` and initialization that involves `CwdSnapshot` and `SysPathsSnapshot`, all relevant to managing the current working directory and paths, indicating that these are areas of the codebase where the reported issue might be addressed. However, while the presence of these components related to directory management suggests that the core issue is being addressed somewhere in the codebase, the exact fixture and test from the issue (`private_dir` and `test_show_wrong_path`) are not directly present in the provided context. Despite this, the file context indicates that the core functionality related to managing directories and reporting accurate paths is present in the form of `MonkeyPatch` and `Testdir`, so it's plausible that the relevant code would be found in the interaction between these components and the fixture's behavior.",
