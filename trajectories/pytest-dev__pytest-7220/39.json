This problem occurs due to pytest displaying file paths relative to the new directory rather than the original one. To address this, we need to investigate how pytest handles directory changes during tests and how it constructs file paths for error reporting. The provided context suggests that the `private_dir` fixture in `test_path_error.py` is causing the issue, as well as the `chdir` method in `src/_pytest/pytester.py`. I will formulate a search to focus on the areas related to directory handling and path construction in pytest to find the relevant code.",

The expected behavior is for the displayed path to remain relative to the original directory. Analyzing the provided search results, several code spans appear relevant to addressing this issue. Specifically, the CwdSnapshot class and its methods (init and restore) in src/_pytest/pytester.py are directly related to managing the current working directory during the test run. Additionally, the Testdir class and its chdir method in the same file could be relevant, as it deals with changing directories during testing. These code spans provide the necessary context to understand how directory changes are managed and potentially where adjustments could be made to ensure the correct path is displayed. Furthermore, the pytest monkeypatch functionality is also important, as seen in src/_pytest/monkeypatch.py, since it allows safe modifications to the environment without affecting other tests or the system state. This could be useful to address the directory change issue by isolating the environment change per test. Lastly, the parametrized test examples in testing/python/fixtures.py demonstrate the use of fixtures and their scoping, which can guide the implementation of a solution that maintains the original directory context across different parts of the test lifecycle.",

Specifically, the `testdir` fixture in `src/_pytest/pytester.py` uses `CwdSnapshot` to manage directory changes and ensures they are restored after the test.

These elements directly relate to the issue of path handling after changing directories during tests, suggesting that the relevant parts of the codebase are provided in the context.",
