Specifically, after changing the directory in a fixture, the relative path to the test file is incorrect, making it impossible to navigate to the error properly in the editor. The issue suggests that the path should remain relative to the original directory. \n\nExamining the provided code snippet from `test_path_error.py`, it shows the implementation of a pytest fixture `private_dir` which changes the working directory. The `test_show_wrong_path` function uses this fixture, but an assertion fails, and the relative path displayed is incorrect, as indicated by the diff provided.\n\nThe search results provided does not directly address the issue at hand. The code in `src/pytest/__main__.py` pertains to the main entry point for running pytest as a script, which is unrelated to the handling of relative paths when directories are changed during a test.\n\nGiven that none of the search results directly correlate with the reported issue concerning relative paths and directory changes in pytest fixtures, it is concluded that the provided search results are not relevant to solving the issue.",

This leads to the editor not being able to jump to the error location because the displayed path is relative to the new directory, not the original one. The expected behavior is for the path to remain relative to the original directory.\n\nFrom the provided file context, we see that the fixture changes the working directory using `os.chdir(out_dir)`. The relevant parts of the codebase seem to be in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` and `src/_pytest/monkeypatch.py`, which handle fixtures and changing the directory.\n\nLooking at the new search results, `src/_pytest/terminal.py` contains the `TerminalReporter` class, which is likely responsible for reporting test outcomes and could be where the path display logic resides. Specifically, the `write_fspath_result` method in `TerminalReporter` writes the file path and result, and this is a likely candidate for the logic that needs to be adjusted to ensure the path remains relative to the original directory.\n\nAdditionally, `src/_pytest/skipping.py` and `src/_pytest/runner.py` have hooks related to test status and reporting, which could also be relevant but less likely to directly affect the path issue. `src/_pytest/resultlog.py` also deals with logging outcomes, which might be useful for debugging but is less directly related to the path display issue.",
