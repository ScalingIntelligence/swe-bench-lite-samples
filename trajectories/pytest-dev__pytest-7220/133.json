The `TestFixtureManagerParseFactories.test_parsefactories_relative_node_ids` and `TestShowFixtures.test_show_fixtures_different_files` methods in `testing/python/fixtures.py` provide tests for handling relative paths and multiple files, which could be relevant for evaluating the impact of directory changes on path display.\n\n3. The `pytest_unconfigure` function and associated `mangle_test_address` method in `src/_pytest/junitxml.py` handle configuration and mangling of test addresses. Adjusting how test addresses are managed could potentially resolve the issue with path display.\n\n4. The `TerminalReporter.write_fspath_result` method could be the most directly relevant code span as it deals with displaying file paths relative to the current working directory, which might be altered due to the fixture.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, focusing on the `write_fspath_result` method in `TerminalReporter` would be a good starting point.

This is causing the editor to be unaware of the directory change, making it impossible to jump to the error. It's expected that the displayed path should stay relative to the original directory.\n\nAlready identified relevant file is 'src/_pytest/terminal.py' which contains the TerminalReporter class dealing with reporting in pytest. Specifically, the 'write_fspath_result' method in this class is responsible for writing the file path results, which is a likely candidate for fixing the path issue.\n\nNewly found relevant files and spans:\n1. 'testing/python/fixtures.py' - This file contains tests related to fixtures, which includes changing directories within fixtures. The 'test_non_relative_path' method deals with testing paths when changing directories, which is directly related to the issue.\n2. 'src/_pytest/python.py' - This file contains the 'show_fixtures_per_test' and '_show_fixtures_per_test' methods which handle showing fixtures per test. The method 'get_best_relpath' is used to get the relative path of functions and could be relevant for ensuring the correct path is displayed.\n3. 'src/_pytest/pytester.py' - This file contains utilities for testing pytest itself, including the 'CwdSnapshot' class which manages snapshots of the current working directory. The 'chdir' method in the 'Testdir' class is directly related to changing the directory and could be a candidate for fixing the path display.\n4. 'src/_pytest/monkeypatch.py' - Specifically, the 'chdir' method in the 'MonkeyPatch' class is relevant as it is used to change the current working directory, which is a key part of the fixture functionality described in the issue.\n\nOverall, the identified spans and methods from these files should help in addressing the issue of the wrong path being displayed when the directory is changed in a fixture.",
