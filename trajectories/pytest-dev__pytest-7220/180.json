The problem is that file paths are displayed relative to the new directory, rather than the original directory, making it difficult to navigate to errors in the editor. The relevant changes need to ensure that path display remains relative to the original directory.\n\nIn the search results, the '_show_fixtures_per_test' function and the 'get_best_relpath' function are particularly relevant. These functions handle how paths are resolved and displayed relative to the current directory. The 'curdir' variable, which represents the current directory, is critical here as it determines the base for relative paths. Modifying how 'curdir' is determined or adjusting the 'bestrelpath' function could help resolve the issue. Specifically, maintaining the original directory context in 'curdir' or adjusting how paths are computed relative to it could be the solution.\n\nExamination of the 'get_best_relpath' function shows it uses 'curdir.bestrelpath(loc)' to determine the relative path. If 'curdir' could be set to the original directory before any fixtures change it, this might solve the problem. This suggests that the modification should focus on ensuring 'curdir' correctly reflects the original directory context before any fixture-induced changes.",

The function `_show_fixtures_per_test` handles the collection and display of fixtures. It's important to delve deeper into how the current directory (`curdir`) is used in path calculations, especially when the directory is changed within a fixture. Additionally, understanding how this impacts the reporting process (e.g., `write_item` function) will be crucial. Investigating further in `src/_pytest` and related modules will be essential to see where directory context changes are integrated into path reporting during errors.",

The expected behavior is for the displayed path to remain relative to the original directory, but the actual behavior shows paths relative to the new directory after the change. The reported code includes a fixture that changes the working directory to 'ddd' and then back to the original directory after the test. The provided search results focus on functions related to fixtures and paths within the pytest framework. The functions 'show_fixtures_per_test' and '_show_fixtures_per_test' are particularly relevant as they handle the display of fixture information, including paths. The 'get_best_relpath' function, which calculates the relative path, is of special interest as it directly influences the path displayed.
