The key elements identified from the issue are the use of `os.chdir`, fixture handling, and the expected vs. displayed directory paths. From the provided context and search results, we see that the `Testdir` class and `MonkeyPatch` class are relevant because they handle directory changes and fixture management. Specifically, the `Testdir.chdir` method and the `MonkeyPatch.chdir` method are directly related to changing directories. Additionally, the `CwdSnapshot` and `SysPathsSnapshot` classes manage the state of the current working directory and system paths, which are relevant for ensuring that the original directory is restored after a fixture modifies the directory. These aspects are crucial for understanding how to fix the issue where the displayed directory path does not stay relative to the original directory. Therefore, the relevant code spans identified belong to the methods and classes mentioned above, which are in the `Testdir` and `MonkeyPatch` classes with IDs `Testdir.chdir`, `MonkeyPatch.chdir`, `CwdSnapshot.__init__`, and `SysPathsSnapshot.__init__`.",

The `Testdir` class has a method `chdir` that changes the current working directory to a temporary directory during fixture setup. The `monkeypatch` fixture also has a method `chdir` that can manipulate the working directory. These mechanisms appear to be central to managing directories in pytest. Additionally, functions like `show_fixtures_per_test` and `write_item` in `python.py` are involved in displaying fixture information and might also be responsible for reporting file paths during test failures. These functions use relative paths, which could be affected by directory changes.
