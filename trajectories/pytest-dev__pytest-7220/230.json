These classes provide methods for handling directory changes (`chdir` in both `Testdir` and `MonkeyPatch`) which is directly related to the issue being discussed. Specifically, the implementation details of `Testdir` and its context management, along with the `MonkeyPatch.chdir` method, are crucial for understanding how directory changes are handled and potentially fixing the issue with path display during tests.
