            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue relates to an exception when multiplying BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks, specifically when block-multiplying more than once. The exception occurs due to the zeros in the result not being ZeroMatrix but Zero, which lacks the 'cols' attribute. This suggests a problem in the handling of ZeroMatrix during block multiplication.\n\nFrom the search results, there are several key sections that are highly relevant to addressing this issue:\n\n1. The `block_collapse` function: This function is responsible for collapsing block matrix operations, including multiplication. It uses various strategies like `bc_matmul` to handle different matrix operations. This function is crucial as it orchestrates how block matrices are processed.\n\n2. The `bc_matmul` function: This function specifically handles block matrix multiplication. It is where the actual multiplication logic resides, and it's the most likely place where the issue occurs. The function iterates through the matrices, applying `_blockmul` for relevant pairs.\n\n3. The `_blockmul` method in the BlockMatrix class: Although not directly included in the provided search results, it is mentioned in the exception traceback. This method is responsible for the internal block multiplication logic and is likely where the ZeroMatrix to Zero conversion happens.\n\nGiven these findings, the most relevant sections to address the issue are `block_collapse` and `bc_matmul`. These sections need to be examined in detail to ensure that ZeroMatrix objects are correctly handled during block multiplication, preventing them from being inadvertently converted to Zero objects that lack necessary attributes.\n\nI will now proceed to identify the exact code spans in the provided search results that are relevant to this issue.",
