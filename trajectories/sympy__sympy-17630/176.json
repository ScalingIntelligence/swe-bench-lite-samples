The exception occurs due to the `Zero` object not having a `cols` attribute. The key areas to focus on are the `BlockMatrix._blockmul` method since this is where the error occurs. Additionally, understanding how the `Zero` objects are being produced during the multiplication process is crucial. From the file context provided, the relevant spans identified include the `BlockMatrix._blockmul`, `bc_matadd`, `bc_dist`, `blockinverse_1x1`, `blockinverse_2x2`, `deblock`, `reblock_2x2`, and `blockcut` methods. These methods provide different aspects of block matrix operations that could be contributing to the issue. However, the main focus should be on the `BlockMatrix._blockmul` method to ensure that it correctly handles ZeroMatrix objects and prevents the conversion to Zero objects that lack the necessary matrix attributes. Based on the search results, the `BlockMatrix._blockmul` and `BlockDiagMatrix._blockadd` methods are again relevant as they deal with the multiplication and addition of block matrices, which is where the error manifests. Thus, the task is not yet complete as there may be other components, such as the `bc_matmul` function mentioned in the traceback, that also play a part in handling the ZeroMatrix objects correctly.",
