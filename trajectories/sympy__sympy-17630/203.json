The relevant parts of the code can be found in `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py` where the `BlockMatrix` class and its `_blockmul` method are located, as well as in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` where the `ZeroMatrix` class is defined. The key sections to look at are the `_blockmul` method in the `BlockMatrix` class, which needs to handle the multiplication of blocks including ZeroMatrix objects, and the properties of `ZeroMatrix` objects, such as the attributes and methods accessed during multiplication. Specifically, the problem arises during the block multiplication when the method tries to access the 'cols' attribute of a 'Zero' object, which suggests that during the multiplication process, zeros are replaced by 'Zero' class objects instead of 'ZeroMatrix' objects. This discrepancy leads to the attribute error. Therefore, the identified code spans include the definitions of these methods and classes that need to be inspected and potentially modified to handle the multiplication of BlockMatrix objects containing ZeroMatrix components properly.",

However, the issue involves an inconsistency when dealing with ZeroMatrix objects during these operations. Specifically, the ZeroMatrix objects seem to transform into a 'Zero' object after the first multiplication, which then triggers an AttributeError when attempting to access the 'cols' attribute during subsequent multiplications. To further investigate, it's essential to narrow down the code parts responsible for this transformation and ensure proper handling of ZeroMatrix objects throughout the operations. This involves revisiting the _blockmul method and related functions in the BlockMatrix class to check how ZeroMatrix objects are processed and possibly enhance their handling to prevent transformations into 'Zero' objects.",
