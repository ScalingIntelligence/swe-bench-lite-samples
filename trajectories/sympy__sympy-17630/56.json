These spans deal with the properties of block sizes and the block multiplication operation itself, which are directly related to the issue described. The exception is caused by attempting to access the 'cols' attribute of a 'Zero' object instead of a 'ZeroMatrix' object, which suggests that the transformation during multiplication might not be correctly handling the ZeroMatrix.

The exception occurs when block-multiplying twice, specifically due to the AttributeError: 'Zero' object has no attribute 'cols'. This suggests that during the multiplication process, ZeroMatrix objects are being replaced or interpreted as a different type of zero object (e.g., 'Zero'), which does not have the 'cols' attribute.\n\nIn the file context provided, relevant code spans include the properties `rowblocksizes` and `colblocksizes` in the `BlockMatrix` class, which reference the `cols` attribute, and the `_blockmul` method, which performs the block multiplication. These methods are directly involved in the operations described in the issue.\n\nFrom the search results, additional relevant code spans are found in the `ZeroMatrix` class from `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, particularly its methods such as `__new__`, `shape`, `__pow__`, `_eval_transpose`, `_eval_trace`, `_eval_determinant`, `conjugate`, `_entry`, and `__nonzero__`. These methods define the behavior of ZeroMatrix objects and how they interact during matrix operations.\n\nAdditionally, in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, there is the `Zero` class. This class defines a different type of zero object that likely does not have the 'cols' attribute, which could be the type of zero object that is causing the issue. Especially relevant are the methods `__abs__`, `__neg__`, `_eval_power`, `_eval_order`, `__nonzero__`, and `as_coeff_Mul`, which provide insights into how the 'Zero' object behaves.\n\nThese identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of the codebase that are likely involved in the reported issue.",
