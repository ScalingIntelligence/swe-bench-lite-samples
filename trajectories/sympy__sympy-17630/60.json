The relevant code spans thus need to focus on the BlockMatrix class and its interaction with ZeroMatrix, specifically the _blockmul and properties that access block sizes. From the context, it's noted that the ZeroMatrix is involved in block multiplication. In the search results, useful spans would be those defining properties like colblocksizes and rowblocksizes in BlockMatrix, as these are critical for the block multiplication operation.

To address this, we need to ensure that any multiplication involving ZeroMatrix objects preserves their type or appropriately handles their conversion.

However, the `_blockmul` method contains logic that assumes the blocks involved in the multiplication are either `BlockMatrix` instances or can be multiplied directly. There is no explicit handling for ensuring that a ZeroMatrix object remains a ZeroMatrix after the multiplication. This oversight could lead to the creation of `Zero` objects instead of ZeroMatrix objects, which causes the exception when accessing the `cols` attribute. The provided method does not explicitly check or preserve the type of the blocks after multiplication, which may inadvertently lead to converting ZeroMatrix to Zero during matrix operations.

However, the `_blockmul` method contains logic that assumes the blocks involved in the multiplication are either `BlockMatrix` instances or can be multiplied directly. There is no explicit handling for ensuring that a ZeroMatrix object remains a ZeroMatrix after the multiplication. This oversight could lead to the creation of `Zero` objects instead of ZeroMatrix objects, which causes the exception when accessing the `cols` attribute. The provided method does not explicitly check or preserve the type of the blocks after multiplication, which may inadvertently lead to converting ZeroMatrix to Zero during matrix operations. This analysis suggests that the search should focus on the `_blockmul` method and ensure that ZeroMatrix objects are properly accounted for during multiplication processes. It may require adding checks for ZeroMatrix objects within the multiplication logic, or implementing specific conversion handling to ensure that ZeroMatrix objects are preserved in the structure, preventing the inadvertent creation of Zero objects that lack the required attributes.",
