This happens specifically when the ZeroMatrix blocks turn into 'Zero' after one multiplication. To understand and potentially fix this, we need to look at how BlockMatrix and ZeroMatrix are handled in the context of multiplication. The relevant parts of the code appear to be in 'blockmatrix.py' and 'matexpr.py'. In 'blockmatrix.py', the '_blockmul' method for BlockMatrix is crucial, as it handles the block-wise multiplication. It checks if the column block sizes of the first matrix match the row block sizes of the second matrix. The exception reported seems to occur because a 'Zero' object does not have a 'cols' attribute, which is accessed in the 'colblocksizes' property. In 'matexpr.py', the ZeroMatrix class is defined, which should handle operations like multiplication and transpose. The ZeroMatrix class doesn't seem to have a direct conflict with the issue as reported, but it's important to confirm that ZeroMatrix behaves as expected in matrix operations. The relevant spans in 'blockmatrix.py' and 'matexpr.py' should focus on the '_blockmul' methods of BlockMatrix and BlockDiagMatrix, and the properties and methods of ZeroMatrix that are involved in matrix operations. It appears that the search has provided relevant code spans; however, it is crucial to ensure that all sections of code necessary for understanding and resolving the issue are covered.",
