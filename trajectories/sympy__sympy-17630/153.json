The provided search results include code spans from the 'sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py' file, which is relevant to the issue as it contains the implementation of BlockMatrix and related classes. The '_blockmul' method in the BlockMatrix class is of particular interest as it is involved in the block multiplication operation. This method is defined to handle the multiplication of blocks only if the block sizes match, which might be the root cause of the issue when ZeroMatrix blocks are involved. Additionally, the BlockDiagMatrix class is also included, which might provide insights into how block-diagonal matrices are handled differently, potentially hinting at a different approach for handling ZeroMatrix blocks.",
