The exception is caused by the fact that zeros in the result are of type 'Zero' rather than 'ZeroMatrix', which leads to an AttributeError since 'Zero' objects do not have 'cols' attribute. To address this, we need to identify where and why the zeros are being converted from 'ZeroMatrix' to 'Zero'. This might involve inspecting the _blockmul method and the block_collapse function, especially focusing on how zeros are handled during matrix multiplication and collapse operations. Additionally, the relevant classes and methods in the sympy.matrices.expressions module should be examined.",

In 'blockmatrix.py', we find spans related to BlockMatrix properties and methods, including '_blockmul', 'block_collapse', and 'bc_matmul', which are directly involved in matrix multiplication and block matrix operations. In 'matexpr.py', we find the 'ZeroMatrix' class definition and its methods, which are relevant for understanding how ZeroMatrix objects are handled.

The `colblocksizes` property in `BlockMatrix` attempts to access the 'cols' attribute of each block, which is problematic if any block is a 'Zero' object instead of a 'ZeroMatrix'. The 'Zero' object does not have the 'cols' attribute, leading to the AttributeError. Specifically, the problematic line is:\n\n```python\nreturn [self.blocks[0, i].cols for i in range(self.blockshape[1])]\n```\n\nFurther down in the context provided, the `_blockmul` method is defined. In this method, the multiplication logic doesn't appear to explicitly handle the conversion or preservation of 'ZeroMatrix' objects, which might be why they turn into 'Zero' during the multiplication process.\n\nThe `block_collapse` function and its utility `bc_matmul` should also be examined, as they play a role in matrix operations involving `BlockMatrix` objects. The `bc_matmul` function iterates over matrices and, if two adjacent matrices are `BlockMatrix` instances, it uses `_blockmul` to multiply them. This process might inadvertently convert 'ZeroMatrix' to 'Zero'.\n\nTo resolve this issue, one needs to identify where the conversion from 'ZeroMatrix' to 'Zero' occurs within the `_blockmul` method and ensure 'ZeroMatrix' objects are preserved during multiplication operations.",
