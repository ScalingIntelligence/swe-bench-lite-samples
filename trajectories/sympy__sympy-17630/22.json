The traceback points to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'cols' attribute on a 'Zero' object, indicating that the zeros are not being correctly handled as ZeroMatrix instances in subsequent multiplications. This suggests an issue in the handling of ZeroMatrix during the multiplication process. The current file context already includes relevant spans such as '_blockmul' and '_blockadd' in both BlockMatrix and BlockDiagMatrix classes, which are key to understanding the multiplication and addition of block matrices. The new search results reveal additional definitions for these methods in both BlockMatrix and BlockDiagMatrix classes, confirming the initial focus on these methods. The issue likely involves the conversion or recognition of ZeroMatrix objects during the block multiplication process. Given the information provided, the identified spans in the BlockMatrix and BlockDiagMatrix classes are relevant to addressing the issue, focusing on the multiplication process and how ZeroMatrix objects are handled.",
