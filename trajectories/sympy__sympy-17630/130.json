The exception occurs when block-multiplying twice, specifically due to the zeros in the result of the first multiplication being of type 'Zero' instead of 'ZeroMatrix'. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the 'cols' attribute of 'Zero' objects.\n\nFrom the current context, the relevant files identified are 'sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py' and 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py'. The key code spans include the '_blockmul' method in 'BlockMatrix' and 'ZeroMatrix' class definition.\n\nIn the new search results, additional relevant code spans are found in 'blockmatrix.py', specifically in the '_blockmul', 'shape', 'blocks', 'rowblocksizes', and 'colblocksizes' methods of 'BlockMatrix'. These are relevant because they deal with the structure and multiplication of BlockMatrix objects, which is central to the reported issue. Also, the 'bc_matmul' function is relevant as it handles matrix multiplication involving BlockMatrix objects.\n\nFrom 'matexpr.py', the 'ZeroMatrix' class and its methods remain relevant, particularly those dealing with properties and operations of ZeroMatrix objects, as the issue involves the treatment of ZeroMatrix instances within BlockMatrix operations.\n\nGiven the context and the new search results, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue and sufficient to address the problem.",
