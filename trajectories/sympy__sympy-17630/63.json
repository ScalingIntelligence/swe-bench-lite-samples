The exception occurs because the zeros in the resulting BlockMatrix are of type `Zero` rather than `ZeroMatrix`. This leads to an 'AttributeError' when accessing the 'cols' attribute on an instance of `Zero`. The file context and search results focus on the `blockmatrix.py` file, which contains the implementation of `BlockMatrix` and `BlockDiagMatrix`, including methods for block multiplication and addition. Relevant code spans include the `_blockmul` method in both `BlockMatrix` and `BlockDiagMatrix` classes, as well as the `bc_matmul` function. These sections handle the block-wise multiplication of matrices and are likely where the error originates. Furthermore, the issue mentions that once block-multiplying works fine, but twice throws an exception, suggesting the `_blockmul` method may not handle subsequent multiplications correctly with ZeroMatrix blocks. Therefore, these sections are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue.",
