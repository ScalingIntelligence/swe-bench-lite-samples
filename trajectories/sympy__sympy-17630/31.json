The exception is due to the zeros in the multiplied matrix not being ZeroMatrix but Zero, which lacks the 'cols' attribute. The key sections in the search results are:\n\n1. BlockMatrix class and its _blockmul method: This is the method responsible for block-wise matrix multiplication. The method checks if the blocks being multiplied are of compatible sizes, but it does not handle the case where ZeroMatrix could be converted to Zero during multiplication.\n\n2. ZeroMatrix class: This class is supposed to represent a matrix filled with zeros. It has methods and properties that define its behavior but does not address the issue of converting to Zero during operations. There is no specific method or attribute that handles the conversion from ZeroMatrix to Zero or the consequences of such a conversion.\n\nGiven these observations, the areas that need to be addressed in the code are the BlockMatrix's _blockmul method to handle the ZeroMatrix-to-Zero conversion properly and to ensure that the zeros resulting from multiplication still maintain the necessary matrix properties (like 'cols' and 'rows'), even if they are now instances of Zero instead of ZeroMatrix.\n\nThe identified spans are: 'BlockMatrix._blockmul' and 'ZeroMatrix', as these are the sections of the code directly involved in the observed issue. Specifically, modifying the _blockmul method in BlockMatrix to account for the possibility of ZeroMatrix blocks turning into Zero objects during multiplication and ensuring that these Zero objects retain methods like 'cols' and 'rows' will likely resolve the issue.",

The _blockmul method in BlockMatrix does not explicitly handle the transition or special cases when ZeroMatrix objects are involved. In the BlockDiagMatrix class, a similar pattern is observed, and it falls back to BlockMatrix._blockmul if the other matrix is not a BlockDiagMatrix. This suggests that a deeper investigation into how ZeroMatrix interacts within these methods is necessary.
