Specifically, the exception occurs when attempting to block-multiply the matrix twice, which indicates a problem with how the ZeroMatrix blocks are handled during multiplication. The key parts of the issue are the use of ZeroMatrix blocks in the BlockMatrix and the exception related to attributes of Zero objects. The search results provided contain relevant code spans, particularly in the BlockMatrix class and its _blockmul method. This method is critical for block multiplication and is where the issue likely arises due to the handling of ZeroMatrix blocks that get transformed into Zero objects during the multiplication process. This transformation prevents further block multiplication due to the Zero objects missing attributes expected by the BlockMatrix class. These code spans provide a starting point for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",
