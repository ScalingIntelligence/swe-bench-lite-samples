The relevant parts of the code are those that handle block multiplication (_blockmul), especially the handling of ZeroMatrix blocks. \n3. The error occurs when the zeros in the block-multiplied result are not ZeroMatrix but Zero. \n4. The current context shows the file 'sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py' and the relevant code spans include handling for block multiplication, block addition, and distribution. \n5. The new search results reinforce the current understanding, showing further sections of the code handling block multiplication, block addition, and distribution, which are directly relevant to the issue at hand. \nConclusion: \nTo address the issue of the exception when block-multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks, a more nuanced handling of ZeroMatrix blocks during block multiplication is necessary. This should include ensuring that after a block multiplication operation, any resulting Zero elements are explicitly converted to ZeroMatrix to avoid downstream AttributeError (\"Zero object has no attribute 'cols'\"). The following code spans from the provided search results are particularly relevant: BlockMatrix._blockmul, BlockDiagMatrix._blockmul, and the general block_collapse function where these block map operations are orchestrated.",

To address this, we need to investigate the BlockMatrix class and its multiplication methods, particularly how ZeroMatrix objects are handled during multiplication. The provided file context includes the BlockMatrix class definition and its methods such as _blockmul and _blockadd, which are relevant to the issue. However, the specific handling of ZeroMatrix objects during multiplication, particularly in the _blockmul method, is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. This suggests that further investigation into how ZeroMatrix objects are processed during multiplication is necessary.",

The exception thrown suggests that during the multiplication process, an instance of 'Zero' is encountered where 'ZeroMatrix' is expected, leading to an attribute error. The error occurs in the `_blockmul` method of the `BlockMatrix` class, specifically in the `colblocksizes` property where it attempts to access the `.cols` attribute on a 'Zero' object. This indicates a need to identify how ZeroMatrix blocks are handled during matrix operations and how they might inadvertently convert to 'Zero'. Relevant code spans include the definition and properties of BlockMatrix, the implementation of _blockmul, the block_collapse function which orchestrates block operations, and any specific handling of ZeroMatrix within these operations.",
