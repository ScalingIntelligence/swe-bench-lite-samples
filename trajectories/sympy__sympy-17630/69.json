To address this, the relevant code spans are identified focusing on the BlockMatrix class and its methods, particularly where ZeroMatrix or Zero objects are involved in multiplication and where dimensions are accessed. The identified spans include the BlockMatrix.__new__, BlockMatrix.shape, BlockMatrix.blockshape, BlockMatrix.blocks, BlockMatrix.rowblocksizes, BlockMatrix.colblocksizes, BlockMatrix.structurally_equal, BlockMatrix._blockmul, BlockMatrix._blockadd, BlockMatrix._eval_transpose, and BlockMatrix._eval_trace methods. Additionally, the bc_matmul function is identified as it handles matrix multiplication involving BlockMatrix instances. These spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue related to the handling of ZeroMatrix blocks during BlockMatrix operations.",
