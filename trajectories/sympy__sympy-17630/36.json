The provided context suggests that the colblocksizes method iterates over the blocks of the matrix to retrieve column sizes, which would include the ZeroMatrix blocks. The _blockmul method is also included, which is directly related to the block multiplication operation described in the issue. Further, the issue notes that the zeros in the result of 'b._blockmul(b)' are of type 'Zero' instead of 'ZeroMatrix', which is a key point for the bug. This suggests that the method 'block_collapse' might also be relevant, as it is used in the test cases provided in the issue.
