The problem occurs when attempting to block-multiply the matrix b (which contains ZeroMatrix blocks) twice, leading to an exception. The analysis suggests that the exception is caused by the zeros in `b._blockmul(b)` not being ZeroMatrix but Zero, which lacks the attribute 'cols'. Given the search results, the relevant parts of the code appear to be the `_blockmul` method in both the `BlockMatrix` and `BlockDiagMatrix` classes. These methods are responsible for handling the block multiplication of matrices. Since the issue involves the behavior of ZeroMatrix blocks specifically, focusing on the `_blockmul` methods where these blocks interact will likely pinpoint the source of the problem. This approach should help in understanding the code context and resolving the reported issue.",
