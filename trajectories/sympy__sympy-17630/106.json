The search results show relevant code spans: 'BlockMatrix' class and its '_blockmul' method, which handles block multiplication. This method is crucial for understanding how the multiplication of BlockMatrices is implemented and how ZeroMatrix blocks might be treated. Additionally, the 'BlockDiagMatrix' class and its '_blockmul' method are also relevant as they inherit from 'BlockMatrix' and may also handle ZeroMatrix blocks.

The exception is attributed to the ZeroMatrix blocks being converted to the Zero object, which lacks the 'cols' attribute. To address this issue, it's crucial to identify and understand the code responsible for handling block multiplication and ZeroMatrix blocks. The initial file context provided includes the BlockMatrix class and its _blockmul method, which is relevant as it deals with block multiplication. The search results provide additional context, including the MatrixExpr class from matexpr.py, which defines ZeroMatrix and its properties. It's important to note that ZeroMatrix is expected to maintain its matrix properties throughout operations, and the conversion to Zero (core.numbers.Zero) is likely problematic. The identified spans include the ZeroMatrix class and its methods, such as __new__, shape, __pow__, _eval_transpose, _eval_trace, _eval_determinant, conjugate, _entry, and __nonzero__. These spans are relevant as they define the behavior of ZeroMatrix, which is key to resolving the issue since the error occurs due to the lack of matrix attributes in the Zero object. Based on this analysis, the relevant spans have been identified.",
