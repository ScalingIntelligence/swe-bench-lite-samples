The exception occurs because the zeros in the result of the first block multiplication are of type 'Zero' instead of 'ZeroMatrix', causing an AttributeError when trying to access the 'cols' attribute. The relevant files and code spans appear to be in 'blockmatrix.py'. The identified code spans include the '_blockmul' method within both the 'BlockMatrix' and 'BlockDiagMatrix' classes, as well as the 'block_collapse' function that orchestrates the collapsing of block matrix operations. The 'bc_dist' function, which handles the distribution of scalar factors in matrix expressions, is also included as it might be relevant for understanding how factors are distributed within block matrices containing zeros. These spans are likely relevant to the issue because they involve the core operations where the ZeroMatrix blocks are handled and where the exception is being thrown. The analysis of these code spans will help in identifying the exact point where the zeros are not properly converted back to ZeroMatrix, leading to the exception.",
