The exception is triggered when attempting to access the 'cols' attribute of a 'Zero' object, which arises after performing the block multiplication. This suggests that the block multiplication process is not properly preserving the ZeroMatrix type, instead converting it to a plain 'Zero' object. The relevant code spans are located in the BlockMatrix class within the blockmatrix.py file, specifically in the _blockmul method. This method is responsible for the block multiplication operation and is where the type conversion issue likely occurs. The analysis of the code shows that the _blockmul method checks for compatible block sizes but does not handle the conversion of ZeroMatrix to Zero explicitly, which is a key part of the reported issue. Additionally, the BlockDiagMatrix class also contains a _blockmul method, though it is less likely to be directly relevant unless the BlockDiagMatrix conversion involves similar issues. The identified code spans focus on the BlockMatrix class methods since they are directly related to the reported issue.",

The exception occurs specifically when trying to access the 'cols' attribute of a 'Zero' object instead of a 'ZeroMatrix'. This suggests a problem in the handling of ZeroMatrix or Zero objects within the BlockMatrix multiplication logic.\n\nThe provided file context and search results give insight into the relevant parts of the codebase. The critical methods to look at are '_blockmul', 'colblocksizes', and 'rowblocksizes', as they are central to the multiplication and size checks of the blocks. The search results confirm these methods and additional properties like 'shape', 'blockshape', and 'blocks' used in these operations. The analysis shows that the issue might stem from the conversion of ZeroMatrix to Zero during multiplication, which then fails due to missing 'cols' attributes. The identified spans cover all these critical areas, indicating a comprehensive analysis of the code related to the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue describes an exception occurring when block-multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks, specifically when multiplying it twice. The exception is due to the zeros in the result of the first multiplication being 'Zero' rather than 'ZeroMatrix', causing an AttributeError when trying to access the 'cols' attribute.\n\nThe initial file context and search results provide a detailed view of the BlockMatrix class and related functions, particularly focusing on the properties and methods related to block multiplication and addition. The key functions identified that are likely relevant to the issue include '_blockmul', 'colblocksizes', and potentially '_blockadd' and 'rowblocksizes' given their roles in handling block matrix operations.\n\nFrom the search results, it's clear that the '_blockmul' method checks if the BlockMatrix being multiplied is of another BlockMatrix and matches the block sizes for multiplication. The 'colblocksizes' property, which is used in this method, accesses the columns of each block and could be the source of the issue if a 'Zero' object instead of 'ZeroMatrix' is encountered without handling for this case.\n\nGiven the intricate nature of block matrix operations and the need to handle both 'ZeroMatrix' and 'Zero' objects appropriately, the identified code spans ('BlockMatrix._blockmul' and 'BlockMatrix.colblocksizes') are crucial for addressing the reported issue. Further investigation into the specific handling of these types in the '_blockmul' method and during the computation of 'colblocksizes' is necessary to ensure that the multiplication process correctly propagates and manages 'ZeroMatrix' objects.\n\nAdditionally, examining the method that converts matrices to a block structure ('reblock_2x2') may also be pertinent, as it could influence how 'Zero' or 'ZeroMatrix' objects are integrated into block matrices during operations like multiplication.\n\nIn conclusion, the search has identified a set of methods and properties within the BlockMatrix class that are directly involved in the logic pertinent to the reported issue. Careful scrutiny and potentially adjusted handling of 'ZeroMatrix' and 'Zero' objects in these sections of the code are suggested for addressing the issue of exceptions during block multiplication.",
