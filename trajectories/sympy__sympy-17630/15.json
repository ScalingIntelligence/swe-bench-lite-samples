The exception occurs because the zeros in the resulting matrix after the first multiplication are of type 'sympy.core.numbers.Zero' instead of 'ZeroMatrix'. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'cols' attribute on these 'Zero' objects during subsequent multiplications. The relevant code spans identified are the definition of the BlockMatrix class, particularly the _blockmul method, which handles the block multiplication of BlockMatrix instances. It appears that the _blockmul method does not properly handle the conversion of the zero results to ZeroMatrix, causing the observed error. Additional review of other related methods, such as BlockDiagMatrix's _blockmul, might also be necessary to ensure consistency and proper handling of ZeroMatrix instances throughout the codebase.",
