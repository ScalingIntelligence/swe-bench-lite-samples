        "message": "The provided file context from `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py` shows that the `BlockMatrix` class has methods and properties specifically related to handling blocks within matrices. The `_blockmul` method is used for block-wise multiplication, and it accesses the `colblocksizes` and `rowblocksizes` properties to ensure the dimensions match. The issue identified is that during multiplication, `ZeroMatrix` objects are not handled correctly, and they turn into 'Zero' objects, causing an `AttributeError` when accessing the `cols` attribute. To fix this, the `_blockmul` method should ensure that `ZeroMatrix` objects remain as such during multiplication operations. This might involve checking the type before attempting to access `cols` or any other attributes specific to `ZeroMatrix`.",
