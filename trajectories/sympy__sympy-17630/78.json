The exception occurs when block-multiplying the matrix twice, specifically due to an AttributeError on the 'Zero' object not having a 'cols' attribute. This error arises because the zeros in the result of the first block-multiplication are of type 'Zero' instead of 'ZeroMatrix'. This discrepancy can be traced back to the implementation of the '_blockmul' method in the BlockMatrix class and potentially in related classes like BlockDiagMatrix. To address this issue, we need to inspect the '_blockmul' method and how it handles multiplication involving ZeroMatrix blocks to ensure consistency in the types of resulting zero blocks. The provided search results contain the relevant 'BlockMatrix' and 'BlockDiagMatrix' classes with their '_blockmul' methods, which are essential for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

To solve this, we need to look into how these properties are accessed and ensure that any ZeroMatrix objects are not inadvertently converted to 'Zero' before accessing their 'cols'.
