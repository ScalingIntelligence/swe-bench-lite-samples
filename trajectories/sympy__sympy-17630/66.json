The error occurs because zeros in the BlockMatrix after multiplication are not of type ZeroMatrix but Zero. This suggests that the BlockMatrix class or related functions might need to handle ZeroMatrix instances differently during multiplication.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about an exception when multiplying BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks. The exception occurs when attempting to access the 'cols' attribute of a 'Zero' object, which is due to the zeros in the result of the first multiplication not being ZeroMatrix but Zero. To identify relevant code spans, we should focus on the BlockMatrix class and its methods related to multiplication and block structures, especially those dealing with ZeroMatrix objects. The search results provided include the BlockMatrix class definition and several methods such as _blockmul, colblocksizes, and block_collapse. These methods are directly related to the issue at hand because they handle block matrix multiplication, accessing block dimensions, and collapsing block matrices. The colblocksizes method is particularly relevant as it attempts to access the 'cols' attribute of blocks, which can lead to the AttributeError when encountering a 'Zero' object. Additionally, the _blockmul method is crucial as it performs block multiplication and could be where the ZeroMatrix objects turn into Zero objects, leading to the exception.",

It contains the BlockMatrix class definition along with methods such as `_blockmul`, `colblocksizes`, and `block_collapse`. The error 'AttributeError: 'Zero' object has no attribute 'cols'' occurs in the `colblocksizes` property, which assumes that all blocks have a 'cols' attribute. This could be fixed by ensuring that ZeroMatrix instances are not converted to Zero during multiplication. Specifically, the `_blockmul` method should handle ZeroMatrix instances carefully to prevent this conversion. Additionally, the `block_collapse` function plays a role in reducing block matrices, and its strategies for handling MatMul (bc_matmul) and other operations should be examined for potential enhancements to handle ZeroMatrix correctly.",

The exception occurs when trying to access the 'cols' attribute of a 'Zero' object during the block multiplication process. The key elements identified from the reported issue are the BlockMatrix class, the ZeroMatrix class, and the _blockmul method. From the provided search results, several code spans are relevant: the BlockMatrix class definition, the colblocksizes property, the _blockmul method, and the block_collapse function. These spans are relevant because they directly involve the logic for block matrix multiplication and handling of matrix properties like 'cols'. The colblocksizes property is particularly relevant as it accesses the 'cols' attribute of matrix blocks, which is where the exception occurs. Additionally, the block_collapse function is relevant as it uses the _blockmul method and involves collapsing block matrix operations, which is directly related to the issue. Therefore, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of how block matrix multiplication is handled, including the point where the exception is triggered.",
