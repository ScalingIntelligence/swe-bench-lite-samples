The ZeroMatrix class is also present, which is expected to be used in the BlockMatrix operations.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context, notably the presence of the _blockmul method in both BlockMatrix and BlockDiagMatrix classes. The BlockMatrix class has properties for rowblocksizes and colblocksizes, which are used to check if the blocks are compatible for multiplication. The issue arises because the ZeroMatrix blocks are not consistently treated as matrices during the multiplication process, leading to the 'Zero' object not having the 'cols' attribute.\n\nTo address the issue, it is necessary to ensure that ZeroMatrix blocks are handled appropriately in the block multiplication process. Specifically, adjustments are needed in the _blockmul method to ensure that ZeroMatrix objects are treated correctly and do not lead to exceptions when accessing their 'cols' attribute.

The exception arises because the multiplication results in blocks of type `Zero` instead of `ZeroMatrix`, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `.cols` attribute. The relevant code spans provided include methods from `BlockMatrix` that handle multiplication and the properties that check block sizes. The search results include additional methods related to `ZeroMatrix` and its handling, which could be relevant for understanding and fixing the issue. Specifically, the `_eval_derivative_scalar` and `__new__` methods for `ZeroMatrix` in `matexpr.py` might be crucial for understanding how `ZeroMatrix` is instantiated and handled in mathematical operations. Additionally, the `_blockmul` method in `BlockMatrix` and `BlockDiagMatrix` classes in `blockmatrix.py` are directly involved in the multiplication operations that lead to the error. These methods need to be reviewed to ensure that the correct type (`ZeroMatrix` instead of `Zero`) is preserved during multiplication. The properties `rowblocksizes` and `colblocksizes` are also significant as they are used to validate that the block matrix multiplication is valid and were the source of the error. Combining the information from the file context and the search results, it is evident that the main code spans to be identified are those related to the multiplication and handling of `ZeroMatrix` in `BlockMatrix` operations, as well as the properties that assist in this process. Further, looking at the instantiation and behavior of `ZeroMatrix` may provide insights into why it sometimes transforms into the type `Zero`, leading to the exception. Hence, while the provided spans already offer a good start, additional understanding of how `ZeroMatrix` is processed mathematically within the context of matrix expressions might be necessary to fully address the issue.",
