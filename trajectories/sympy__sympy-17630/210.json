The error occurs because the zeros in the resulting matrix are of type 'Zero' instead of 'ZeroMatrix', leading to the failure of accessing the 'cols' attribute. To address this, we need to investigate the BlockMatrix and ZeroMatrix classes, and the block multiplication and block collapse functions specifically. Focus should be on how ZeroMatrix blocks are handled during multiplication and collapse. An additional check could be added to ensure that 'Zero' objects are converted back to 'ZeroMatrix' before operations that depend on the 'cols' attribute.",
