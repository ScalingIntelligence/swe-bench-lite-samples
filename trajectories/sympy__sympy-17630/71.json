The exception occurs when trying to access the 'cols' attribute of a 'Zero' object during block multiplication. This suggests that during multiplication, ZeroMatrix blocks are sometimes being converted to 'Zero' objects, which do not have the 'cols' attribute. To address this, we need to investigate the BlockMatrix and ZeroMatrix classes, focusing on the multiplication logic and how the ZeroMatrix objects are handled in the block_collapse and _blockmul functions.",

Specifically, the error occurs when the zeros in `b._blockmul(b)` are not `ZeroMatrix` but `Zero`, leading to an `AttributeError` when accessing the `cols` attribute. The relevant code spans from the search results include the `BlockMatrix` class and its methods, particularly `_blockmul`, `colblocksizes`, and `rowblocksizes`. These methods are central to the block matrix operations and are likely where the error originates due to improper handling or conversion of ZeroMatrix instances to Zero. Additionally, the `block_collapse` function is relevant as it orchestrates the collapsing of block matrices and might call into the problematic `_blockmul` method. Therefore, identifying and analyzing these sections of code is crucial to understand how ZeroMatrix blocks are being handled and determine potential fixes.",

The relevant code spans include the `BlockMatrix.colblocksizes` property, the `BlockMatrix._blockmul` method, and the `BlockMatrix.rowblocksizes` property, as these are directly involved in the operation and error handling. Additionally, the search results provide further context with properties such as `BlockMatrix.shape`, `BlockMatrix.blockshape`, `BlockMatrix.blocks`, `BlockMatrix.structurally_equal`, and methods like `BlockMatrix._eval_transpose`, `BlockMatrix._eval_trace`, and `BlockMatrix._eval_determinant`, which are relevant for understanding the classes' behaviors when handling blocks.
