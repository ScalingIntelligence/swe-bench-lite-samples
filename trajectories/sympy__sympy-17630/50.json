The key part of the issue is the conversion of ZeroMatrix to Zero during the multiplication process, which leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'cols' attribute. To resolve this, we need to ensure that ZeroMatrix instances are not converted to Zero during multiplication or that Zero instances are handled appropriately. The relevant sections of the code likely involve the _blockmul method and the properties rowblocksizes and colblocksizes of the BlockMatrix class, as these are directly involved in the multiplication and size checking operations. Additionally, the _blockmul method in the BlockDiagMatrix subclass might also be relevant as it handles multiplication differently. The imports section indicates that the ZeroMatrix class is imported from sympy.matrices.expressions.matexpr, suggesting that this module might also contain relevant code for constructing and handling ZeroMatrix instances.\n\nRegarding the search results, we have identified several relevant code spans in the blockmatrix.py file within the sympy/matrices/expressions directory. These include:\n1. The definition of the BlockMatrix class and its properties, particularly rowblocksizes and colblocksizes, which are used to check the sizes of the blocks.\n2. The _blockmul method, which is responsible for multiplying block matrices and where the exception is likely occurring due to the handling of ZeroMatrix and Zero instances.\n3. The _blockmul method in the BlockDiagMatrix subclass, which could provide additional context or a different approach to handling block multiplication.\n4. The shape and blockshape properties, which define the overall structure of the block matrix and are likely used in conjunction with the multiplication methods and size checks.\n\nConsidering the reported issue and the identified code spans, we can conclude that the search task is not complete as additional context from other parts of the codebase, such as how ZeroMatrix is instantiated and maintained through operations, might be necessary to fully understand and fix the issue.",

This exception is due to the fact that zeros in the resulting matrix from the first multiplication are of type 'Zero' rather than 'ZeroMatrix', leading to an AttributeError when accessing the 'cols' attribute. This issue is relevant to understanding how BlockMatrix multiplications are handled and how the type of zeros affects subsequent operations. The provided search results contain multiple relevant code spans within the 'sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py' file. These spans include definitions of BlockMatrix, BlockDiagMatrix, and their respective multiplication and addition methods. The properties 'rowblocksizes' and 'colblocksizes' are particularly relevant, as the error occurs when comparing these properties during the multiplication. The '_blockmul' method implementations in both BlockMatrix and BlockDiagMatrix are also critical, as they define the multiplication logic. Furthermore, the '__new__' method in BlockMatrix is relevant as it constructs the BlockMatrix object, potentially affecting how the matrices and their blocks are initialized and handled.",

The '_blockmul' method in the 'BlockMatrix' class is responsible for block-level multiplication, and it includes checks for block sizes and performs block-wise multiplication. However, the error suggests that during this multiplication process, zeros are not consistently being treated as 'ZeroMatrix' objects but as general 'Zero' objects. To resolve this, we need to ensure that any zero encountered is correctly identified as a 'ZeroMatrix'. It is also important to check if there are additional methods or properties in 'BlockMatrix' or related classes that handle or influence the type of zeros used during matrix operations, such as properties that assess block sizes ('rowblocksizes' and 'colblocksizes'). Investigating these areas will likely yield the necessary insight to fix the issue.",

The relevant code spans identified in the context and search results involve the BlockMatrix class and its methods such as _blockmul, rowblocksizes, and colblocksizes. These methods are crucial for the multiplication and handling of block matrices. From the search results, it is evident that the _blockmul method in both BlockMatrix and BlockDiagMatrix classes needs to be checked for how it handles the ZeroMatrix elements to ensure they remain as ZeroMatrix after multiplication to avoid the AttributeError. Additionally, the properties rowblocksizes and colblocksizes, which are used in the _blockmul method, also need to be reviewed to ensure they correctly handle ZeroMatrix elements.",
