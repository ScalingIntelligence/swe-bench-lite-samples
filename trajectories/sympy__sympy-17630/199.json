The error indicates that Zero objects do not have a 'cols' attribute, which suggests that the BlockMatrix operations might be mishandling instances of ZeroMatrix, converting them to Zero. To debug and resolve this, we need to investigate the BlockMatrix class and related functions such as _blockmul and block_collapse in the blockmatrix.py file. We should also examine how ZeroMatrix is handled in matexpr.py and potentially in matmul.py. Given that the issue involves BlockMatrix operations and the ZeroMatrix class, these are the key areas to focus on for the search.",

The exception occurs when trying to access the 'cols' attribute of a 'Zero' object during block multiplication. To address this, we need to identify the code spans that handle block multiplication and the conversion or handling of ZeroMatrix objects in the multiplication process.\n\nIn the provided search results, we see relevant methods such as `_blockmul` in the `BlockMatrix` and `BlockDiagMatrix` classes. These methods are crucial for understanding how block matrices are multiplied. We also see that there is a `block_collapse` function that might be central to the multiplication process, and it uses `bc_matmul` to handle matrix multiplication. Furthermore, the issue might be related to how ZeroMatrix objects are treated during these operations, particularly in `BlockMatrix._blockmul` where the 'Zero' object is mentioned to lack the 'cols' attribute.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans to investigate further are those related to block multiplication (`_blockmul`), handling of ZeroMatrix or Zero objects, and the `bc_matmul` function. These spans will help in diagnosing why the 'Zero' object does not have the 'cols' attribute during multiplication and to propose a solution.",
