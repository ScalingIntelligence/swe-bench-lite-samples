The error occurs during the second block-multiplication, specifically when trying to access the 'cols' attribute of a 'Zero' object instead of a 'ZeroMatrix' object. This suggests that during the multiplication, the ZeroMatrix objects are being converted to the Zero type, which does not have the 'cols' attribute. To resolve this, we need to investigate the specific parts of the BlockMatrix and ZeroMatrix classes that handle multiplication and the conversion of ZeroMatrix to Zero.",

The exception is due to the fact that the zeros in the result of the first block multiplication are not ZeroMatrix but Zero, and Zero does not have the 'cols' attribute required for further block multiplication. This is a critical area to focus on. In the search results, several sections are relevant: 1. The definition and properties of BlockMatrix, including shape, blockshape, blocks, and block-specific properties like rowblocksizes and colblocksizes, which are crucial for understanding the structure and handling of BlockMatrix. 2. The _blockmul and _blockadd methods, which define the multiplication and addition operations for BlockMatrix, respectively. These methods are directly related to the issue since the error occurs during block multiplication. 3. The definition of ZeroMatrix in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py', which is necessary for understanding how zero matrices are handled in the context of matrix expressions. Given the issue description and the search results, the relevant code spans are those that involve BlockMatrix operations and the handling of zero matrices, particularly in the context of block multiplication.",

The current context has snippets from relevant parts of the code, including BlockMatrix properties for row and column block sizes and the _blockmul method itself. The new search results confirm the presence of the BlockMatrix class and its methods, with additional methods and properties in the BlockMatrix class that might be relevant, such as the structurally_equal method and the _eval_trace and _eval_determinant methods, although the latter might not be immediately relevant to the specific issue at hand. The search results on the matexpr.py side reveal more about how ZeroMatrix is handled, but nothing new specifically to address the exception in the block multiplication.
