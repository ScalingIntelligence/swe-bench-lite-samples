The exception occurs because the zeros in the result of `b._blockmul(b)` are of type `sympy.core.numbers.Zero` instead of `ZeroMatrix`, leading to an AttributeError when accessing the 'cols' attribute.\n\nTo address this, it's crucial to identify the locations where the `ZeroMatrix` is converted to `Zero` or where the conversion might be missed. The relevant code spans in the provided search results include the `BlockMatrix._blockmul` method, which is where the block multiplication happens. This method is responsible for checking the block sizes and performing the multiplication. Additionally, the `BlockDiagMatrix._blockmul` method inherits from `BlockMatrix` and overrides the multiplication behavior, which is also relevant to consider. Ensuring that `ZeroMatrix` instances are correctly handled during multiplication can help resolve the issue.\n\nBy analyzing the provided code spans, it becomes clear that the `_blockmul` methods are central to the issue.
