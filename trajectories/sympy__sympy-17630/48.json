            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates an exception when block-multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks, particularly when multiplying twice. The traceback suggests that the error occurs because zeros in the result of `b._blockmul(b)` are not `ZeroMatrix` but `Zero`, leading to an `AttributeError` when accessing the `cols` attribute. Initially, the relevant code spans within the BlockMatrix class and its methods are analyzed. Key methods like `_blockmul`, `colblocksizes`, and others involved in the block matrix multiplication and collapse operations are inspected. The current context provided is empty, suggesting no previous identification of relevant code. The search results provided a comprehensive look at the BlockMatrix class and associated functions, which are relevant to the issue. The focus is on methods such as `_blockmul`, `colblocksizes`, and `block_collapse` due to their direct involvement in operations related to block matrix multiplication and handling properties of the matrices like size and shape during these operations. These methods involve the handling of zero matrices and shape attributes, making them crucial to address the issue. Further, the `block_collapse` function which triggers the rule-based processing of expressions involving BlockMatrix is identified as critical, particularly the `bc_matmul` function which handles matrix multiplication expressions. It's noted that the handling of ZeroMatrix in the multiplications might need specific attention to ensure they do not degrade into plain Zero instances prematurely, which lack matrix properties like shapes that are crucial for correct block matrix operations.",

Based on the reported issue, the focus should be on the '_blockmul' method and the 'colblocksizes' property, as these are where the exception originates. After examining the new code spans, it is clear that the methods '_blockmul' and properties like 'colblocksizes' are prioritized in both the context and the new search results, indicating that we have the necessary code to resolve the issue.
