The `_blockmul` method for `BlockDiagMatrix` also exists, delegating to `BlockMatrix._blockmul` if the types do not match. This suggests that the issue might be occurring due to the mismatch in types or improper handling of `ZeroMatrix` during this verification or multiplication process. The properties `rowblocksizes` and `colblocksizes` utilize list comprehensions to fetch the row and column sizes from the blocks, which might need additional checks to ensure that `ZeroMatrix` objects are not inadvertently converted to the 'Zero' type, leading to the observed `AttributeError`.",
