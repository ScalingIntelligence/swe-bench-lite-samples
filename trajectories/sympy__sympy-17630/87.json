The method contains logic that checks if the `BlockMatrix` being multiplied has matching column block sizes with the other matrix's row block sizes. However, there is no explicit handling of `ZeroMatrix` blocks being converted to `Zero` objects. This conversion could potentially happen due to some internal SymPy behavior not captured in the `_blockmul` method itself, which could be the cause of the AttributeError. Additionally, the `block_collapse` function is used for collapsing block matrices operations, and any exception occurring in this process could be related to the `_blockmul` method's handling of `ZeroMatrix` objects. The provided file context seems focussed on `BlockMatrix` operations including multiplication and addition without specific cases related directly to `ZeroMatrix` objects.

This includes looking into `bc_matmul` and wider strategies like `block_collapse` to understand the data transformation rules and properties' determination processes, especially on instances like ZeroMatrix. Furthermore, exploring related utilities and core functionalities like sifting and matrix expansion might also illuminate conditions under which ZeroMatrix could be transmuted into a problematic Zero.
