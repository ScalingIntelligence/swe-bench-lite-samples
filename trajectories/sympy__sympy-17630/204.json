The issue arises because the zeros in the result of the first block-multiplication are of type `Zero` instead of `ZeroMatrix`, which causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the 'cols' attribute in subsequent multiplications. The search results provide relevant code in the 'BlockMatrix' class, particularly the '_blockmul' method, which is the method used for block-multiplication. This method checks if the two block matrices being multiplied have compatible block sizes and then performs the multiplication. The code related to 'ZeroMatrix' and the handling of block sizes in '_blockmul' is crucial for understanding and fixing the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans are '_blockmul' and related methods that deal with block sizes and types of matrices.",
