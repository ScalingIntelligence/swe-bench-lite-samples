These files contain the implementation of the FigureCanvas for Qt and macOS backends, respectively. The relevant code spans include the initialization and draw methods for the FigureCanvas in both backends. The presence of `_draw_pending` and `_is_drawing` flags in the initialization methods and the use of `_draw_idle` method in both backends suggest that the issue might be related to how these flags and methods handle drawing and re-drawing of the figure, potentially affecting the widget interaction.

The provided code for reproduction demonstrates this behavior, with the actual outcome being that widgets cannot receive input from mouse clicks when redrawing in the `on_changed` callback of a range slider, unlike when using a button. The expected outcome is for the range slider callback `on_changed` to behave the same as the button callback `on_clicked`.

In `backend_qt.py`, the `FigureCanvasQT` class is relevant as it handles the drawing and event handling for Qt-based backends, particularly the `_draw_idle` method which manages the redrawing of the figure. The `backend_macosx.py` file contains similar handling for the MacOSX backend but is not directly relevant to the reported issue which is specific to the Qt backend.

The user observes that redrawing the figure using `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` in the `on_changed` callback of a RangeSlider blocks input to other widgets, whereas the same operations in a Button's `on_clicked` callback work correctly. This discrepancy suggests an issue related to how widget events are handled or how the canvas is redrawn. After analyzing the search results, the most relevant code spans include: `Button.__init__` and `RangeSlider.__init__` from `widgets.py`, which contain the initialization code for these widgets and their event connections. Additionally, `FigureCanvasQT.__init__` and `FigureCanvasQT._draw_idle` from `backend_qt.py` demonstrate how the Qt backend handles figure canvases and redrawing, which is crucial for understanding how drawing operations might interfere with widget inputs. These spans provide a detailed context for the issue, showing how Matplotlib integrates with Qt for GUI events and drawing.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: using clf and pyplot.draw in range slider on_changed callback blocks input to widgets\n### Bug summary\n\nWhen using clear figure, adding new widgets and then redrawing the current figure in the on_changed callback of a range slider the inputs to all the widgets in the figure are blocked. When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
