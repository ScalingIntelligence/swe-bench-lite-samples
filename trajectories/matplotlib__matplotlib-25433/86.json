The issue is that the RangeSlider's on_changed callback blocks input to all widgets when the figure is cleared and redrawn, whereas the Button's on_clicked callback does not have this problem. This discrepancy in behavior is the primary focus of the issue.\n\nTo address this, the search results focused on the backend implementations of Matplotlib widgets in different backends (GTK4, GTK3, Qt, and WebAgg). These implementations contain the callback handling logic for various events such as button presses, key events, and mouse movements. By examining these implementations, we can identify how the on_changed and on_clicked callbacks are handled differently and why the RangeSlider might be blocking input.\n\nThe relevant code spans in the search results include the implementations of event handling in the GTK4 and GTK3 backends (such as FigureCanvasGTK4.button_press_event, FigureCanvasGTK4.button_release_event, FigureCanvasGTK3.button_press_event, and FigureCanvasGTK3.button_release_event). Additionally, the Qt backend implementations (FigureCanvasQT.mousePressEvent, FigureCanvasQT.mouseReleaseEvent) and the WebAgg backend (FigureCanvasWebAggCore) are also relevant. These spans show how each backend processes events and could potentially reveal differences in how the RangeSlider's on_changed and the Button's on_clicked callbacks are managed.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, we aim to understand the mechanisms behind the callbacks and why the RangeSlider's callback might interfere with widget input, while the Button's callback does not. This analysis will help in identifying the root cause of the issue and potential solutions.",

When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
