The problem arises specifically when redrawing the figure in the `on_changed` callback of the range slider, causing the widgets to become unresponsive. To pinpoint the issue, we need to investigate the implementation of the `on_changed` callback in the `RangeSlider` class and how redrawing affects the widget states. Additionally, we should look at the `clf` and `draw` functions in `pyplot` to understand their impact on the widget interactions.",

Specifically, when the callback involves clearing the figure (clf), adding new widgets, and redrawing the figure (draw), it results in input being blocked to all widgets on the figure. This behavior is contrasted with the `on_clicked` callback for a button, which works as expected.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are identified as follows:\n\n1. **RangeSlider Class and Methods**: The `RangeSlider` class and its methods within `widgets.py` are central to the issue as they define the behavior of the range slider and its callbacks.\n\n2. **On_changed Callback**: The `on_changed` method within the `RangeSlider` class is directly related to the callback that is problematic in the issue report.\n\n3. **Clear Figure and Redraw**: The `clf` and `draw` functions in `pyplot.py` are relevant as they are used within the callback to clear the current figure and redraw it, which leads to the blocking of input.\n\nBy examining these code spans, we can see the implementation of the RangeSlider's callback and how the `clf` and `draw` functions interact with it. These are crucial for understanding the issue and potentially fixing it.\n\nGiven the issue description and the context provided by the search results, the relevant code spans have been identified, which should be sufficient to either resolve the issue or further investigate the root cause.",

When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
