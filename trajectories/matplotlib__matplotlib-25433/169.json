The specific issue is that the figure redrawing in this callback prevents further interaction with the widgets. To address this, we need to identify the exact point in the Matplotlib codebase where the RangeSlider's on_changed callback is managed. We also need to understand how figure clearing (clf) and redrawing (draw) affect widget interactions. Given the provided context, focusing on the 'widgets.py' module for callback handling and the 'pyplot.py' module for figure management seems appropriate.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: using clf and pyplot.draw in range slider on_changed callback blocks input to widgets\n### Bug summary\n\nWhen using clear figure, adding new widgets and then redrawing the current figure in the on_changed callback of a range slider the inputs to all the widgets in the figure are blocked. When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
