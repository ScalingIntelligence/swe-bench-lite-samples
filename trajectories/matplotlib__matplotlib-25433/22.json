            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a problem with the RangeSlider widget in Matplotlib when its on_changed callback is used to clear the figure, add new widgets, and redraw the figure. This causes the input to all widgets in the figure to be blocked. The issue does not occur when using a Button widget with its on_clicked callback.\n\nAnalysis of the search results shows several relevant classes and methods:\n1. `Button` class and its methods (e.g., `__init__`, `_click`, `_release`, `_motion`, `on_clicked`)\n2. `AxesWidget` class, which is the parent class for `Button` and potentially other widgets.\n3. `RangeSlider` class is not directly present in the search results, but its behavior is related to the interactions with the Matplotlib figure.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, the focus should be on understanding how the `Button` widget handles events compared to how `RangeSlider` might handle them. The `Button` class methods provide insight into event handling, particularly `_click`, `_release`, and `_motion`, which deal with button press, release, and mouse motion events respectively. These methods may contain the key to understanding how to improve or debug the `RangeSlider` widget's event handling to prevent blocking of input.\n\nSince `RangeSlider` is not directly found in the search results, it is inferred that the problem might lie in the way the `RangeSlider` widget or its parent classes handle the `on_changed` event, compared to how the `Button` widget handles the `on_clicked` event. Further investigation into how `RangeSlider` handles these events and interacts with the Matplotlib canvas would be necessary to resolve the issue.\n\nGiven the complexity and the specifics of the issue, it is crucial to identify sections of code in different callbacks that lead to the blocking of input, and how these might be adjusted to maintain user interaction without blocking. The key sections to focus on initially are around event handling and draw calls, as these are central to the problem. The provided code spans, especially in the `Button` class definitions and methods, offer guidance on event management and redrawing interactions that might help in identifying the root cause of the problem.",

This contrasts with the behavior observed in the `on_clicked` callback of a `Button` widget, where similar actions do not result in such blocking. Given the context provided in <file_context>, the relevant parts of the codebase include the `Button` class, which handles button click events without issues, and the `RangeSlider` class, which is implicated in the reported problem. The new search results in <search_results> provide additional context for the `RangeSlider` class, particularly focusing on the `RangeSlider._update` and `RangeSlider._update_val` methods, which manage the behavior of the slider during event interactions. These methods handle the updates to the slider's position and value based on user input. The `RangeSlider._update` method is of particular relevance as it directly deals with event handling and updates during slider interactions. This method sets the `drag_active` state and manages the mouse grab and release events, which are critical for understanding why input might be blocked during certain callbacks. Comparing the handling of events in `RangeSlider` with those in `Button`, especially considering the `drag_active` state and mouse event management, could provide insights into the underlying issue. The identified spans thus focus on the methods within the `RangeSlider` class that directly impact event handling and UI responsiveness.",

The RangeSlider, on the other hand, updates its state through the _update method when the slider's value changes and does not explicitly describe how it handles redrawing the canvas. To find more relevant code, we should investigate the RangeSlider's _update method and see how it interacts with the canvas and other widgets in the figure.

When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
