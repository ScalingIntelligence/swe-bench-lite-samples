Specifically, the bug occurs when using `clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` within the `RangeSlider`'s `on_changed` callback, which blocks input to all widgets in the figure. This issue does not occur when the same operations are performed in the `Button`'s `on_clicked` callback.\n\nAnalysis of the provided search results shows that the relevant parts of the codebase for the `RangeSlider` and `Button` classes are included. The `RangeSlider` class includes the `on_changed` method, which connects a callback function to the 'changed' event. Similarly, the `Button` class includes the `on_clicked` method, which connects a callback function to the 'clicked' event.\n\nThe relevant code spans are those that define the callback methods (`on_changed` for `RangeSlider` and `on_clicked` for `Button`), as well as the initialization and update methods (`__init__` and `_update`) for both classes. These methods are crucial for understanding the behavior of the widgets and how the callbacks are triggered.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are sufficient to understand the current implementation and to potentially debug or modify the behavior to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: using clf and pyplot.draw in range slider on_changed callback blocks input to widgets\n### Bug summary\n\nWhen using clear figure, adding new widgets and then redrawing the current figure in the on_changed callback of a range slider the inputs to all the widgets in the figure are blocked. When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
