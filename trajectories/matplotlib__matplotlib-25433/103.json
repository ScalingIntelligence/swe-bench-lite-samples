We should also consider the specific methods and classes related to these actions in Matplotlib.",

The issue specifically mentions that inputs to other widgets are blocked when this is done, whereas no such problem occurs with the 'on_clicked' callback of a Button widget. To identify relevant code spans, I focused on the RangeSlider class and its methods, especially those related to the 'on_changed' callback and updating the slider. The 'RangeSlider.__init__', 'RangeSlider._update', and 'RangeSlider.on_changed' spans are directly relevant as they deal with the initialization, updating, and event handling of the RangeSlider widget. These sections of the code are crucial for understanding how the RangeSlider and its callback mechanisms work, which is essential for addressing the issue of input blocking described in the reported issue. Thus, these spans are key for addressing the problem and should be included in the identified spans.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: using clf and pyplot.draw in range slider on_changed callback blocks input to widgets\n### Bug summary\n\nWhen using clear figure, adding new widgets and then redrawing the current figure in the on_changed callback of a range slider the inputs to all the widgets in the figure are blocked. When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
