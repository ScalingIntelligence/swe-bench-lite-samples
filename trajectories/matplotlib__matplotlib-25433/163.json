Specifically, the behavior should be studied in comparison to the on_clicked callback of a button, which works as expected. The search should target the Matplotlib library files related to pyplot, widgets, and backends to understand how figure management and widget interaction are handled.",

When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
