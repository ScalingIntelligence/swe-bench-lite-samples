This is unlike the behavior in the button's on_clicked callback where this issue does not occur. The search results contain the implementation of both Slider and RangeSlider classes from matplotlib's widgets module. It's crucial to examine these classes, especially their __init__, _update, and on_changed methods since these are where callbacks and widget interactions are defined. The reported issue involves redrawing the figure and updating widgets within a callback, so the code spans related to callback handling and widget updates are particularly relevant. Therefore, the identified code spans include initializations of slider controls (__init__), the callback registration methods for both Sliders and RangeSliders (on_changed), and the internal update functions triggered during interaction (_update). All these sections are directly related to the functionality that could be causing the input blocking issue when callbacks are executed. Review of these sections indicates they contain all necessary parts of the code logic involved in the issue, namely the setup and triggering of callbacks, and internal widget updates. Additionally, no references to other parts of the codebase that might be necessary for a complete understanding of the issue are found within the sections. Therefore, the identified spans constitute a complete response to the issue's requirements and encapsulate all relevant functionality needed to address the reported bug.",

When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
