This is in contrast to the `on_clicked` callback of a button, which behaves as expected. \n\nTo address this, I've examined the search results for relevant code spans. The `FigureCanvasQT` class in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_qt.py` might be particularly relevant, as it deals with the integration of Matplotlib with the Qt backend. The `drawRectangle` method within this class seems to handle rendering aspects, which could influence the behavior of widget redrawing. \n\nIn addition, the `widgets.py` file contains the `_SelectorWidget` class, which likely includes handling for the range slider's behavior. Notably, the `update` method in this class could influence how changes are redrawn.\n\nFurthermore, other examples and tutorials like `blitting.py`, `image_slices_viewer.py`, and `range_slider.py` offer insights into how updates and redraws are managed in different contexts. These could provide a broader understanding of how redraws can affect widget responsiveness. \n\nGiven the breadth of the search results and the diverse approaches to managing redraws across different contexts, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific solution based solely on these code spans. However, understanding the general patterns in handling redraws and interactions in these different contexts should help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue with the range slider callback.",

However, the exact code for the RangeSlider's on_changed method is not present in the provided context. The range_slider.py example file shows an update function similar to the onchanged function described in the issue, suggesting that the update logic in callbacks like on_changed might need specific considerations, possibly including backend-specific handling or state management.

When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
