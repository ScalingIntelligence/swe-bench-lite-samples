The problem is that after redrawing the figure in the `on_changed` callback, the widgets become unresponsive to user inputs, unlike when the same operations are performed in the `on_clicked` callback of a button. To address this, it's necessary to examine the relevant parts of the Matplotlib codebase, particularly focusing on how the `RangeSlider` and its `on_changed` method interact with the rendering and event handling mechanisms. The search results provide essential code spans corresponding to the `RangeSlider` class, which is likely the primary focus for diagnosing and potentially resolving this issue. Additionally, the `clf` and `draw` functions in `pyplot.py` are directly involved in the problematic behavior described in the issue.",

This suggests an issue in how widget events are handled and how the UI is redrawn during such events. Therefore, adjustments in the `RangeSlider` class are necessary to manage these aspects effectively.",

Consider modifying how the class deals with event processing and redrawing mechanisms to ensure that UI elements remain responsive during updates. This might involve adjustments to the `__init__` method and related event-handling methods to manage UI interactions more effectively without causing input blocking."

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: using clf and pyplot.draw in range slider on_changed callback blocks input to widgets\n### Bug summary\n\nWhen using clear figure, adding new widgets and then redrawing the current figure in the on_changed callback of a range slider the inputs to all the widgets in the figure are blocked. When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
