The issue specifically mentions that when `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` are called within the `on_changed` callback of a `RangeSlider`, the input to the widgets is blocked. However, when these functions are called within the `on_clicked` callback of a `Button`, everything works fine.\n\nFrom the search results, we see definitions for `Button` and `RangeSlider` classes along with their respective constructor and callback methods. The `Button.on_clicked` method sets up the callback for button clicks, while the `RangeSlider.on_changed` method sets up the callback for range slider changes.\n\nGiven the issue description, we need to examine if the problem lies in how these callbacks are set up or executed. The provided code spans from `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` show the definition of these classes and their methods, which directly relate to the reported issue. Specifically, the `on_changed` and `on_clicked` methods are relevant as they implement the behavior that differs between the two widgets.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are sufficient to start investigating why the `on_changed` callback for `RangeSlider` blocks widget input while the `on_clicked` callback for `Button` does not. The search task can be considered complete with the identification of these relevant code spans.",

When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
