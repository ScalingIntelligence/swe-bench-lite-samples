The problem occurs when clearing the figure using `pyplot.clf()` and redrawing it with `pyplot.draw()` within the RangeSlider's callback, which blocks inputs to widgets. The expected behavior is for the RangeSlider callback to behave similarly to the Button callback. To address this, we need to look into the relevant methods and callbacks in the `matplotlib.pyplot` and `matplotlib.widgets` modules, focusing on the `clf`, `draw`, `on_changed`, and `on_clicked` functions.",

This action appears to block further input to the widgets in the figure. By analyzing the search results, we identify the relevant code spans that define the RangeSlider and Button widgets as well as their event handling methods (on_changed for RangeSlider and on_clicked for Button). These spans are crucial for understanding how events are handled during user interaction. They directly relate to the functionality described in the issue. Specifically, we need to carefully review how pyplot.clf() and pyplot.draw() are affecting event handling within these widgets' callback methods to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue. The spans identified capture the initiation of event handling and the Colbeck Registry responsible for managing callbacks, which are key points of examination for debugging the described blocking behavior.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: using clf and pyplot.draw in range slider on_changed callback blocks input to widgets\n### Bug summary\n\nWhen using clear figure, adding new widgets and then redrawing the current figure in the on_changed callback of a range slider the inputs to all the widgets in the figure are blocked. When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
