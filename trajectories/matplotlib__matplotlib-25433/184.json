To investigate this, we need to focus on the `pyplot.clf()`, `pyplot.draw()`, and the `RangeSlider` class including its `on_changed` method. Additionally, examining the backend handling, especially `backend_qt.py` and `backend_bases.py`, could provide insights into how GUI events are processed and how this might be affecting widget interactions.",

This suggests an issue with the interaction or redrawing mechanism in the range slider callback. Given the scope of the issue, it's relevant to look into the backend implementations of the range slider and the way they handle redraw events. The provided search results include code spans from `backend_qt.py`, `_backend_gtk.py`, and `_backend_tk.py`, which are relevant as they contain the backend-specific implementations of the figure canvas and navigation toolbar, including methods for drawing rubberbands and handling mouse events. Key spans to look at include `FigureCanvasQT` for the Qt backend, `_NavigationToolbar2GTK` for the GTK backend, and `NavigationToolbar2Tk` for the Tk backend, as well as their respective methods for handling rubberband drawing and mouse events. These code spans are relevant to understanding how widget interactions and redrawing are managed in different backends, which could help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the reported issue with the range slider callback.",

Within the 'backend_qt.py' file, relevant methods such as 'mousePressEvent', 'mouseMoveEvent', 'keyPressEvent', 'drawRectangle', and 'draw_rubberband' are found, showing how the backend handles various GUI interactions. The provided code snippet showing the issue makes references to `pyplot.clf()`, `pyplot.draw()`, and `RangeSlider`'s `on_changed` method, all of which are broadly covered under this backend code. This suggests that while the specific bug might require detailed diagnosis within these backend frameworks, the code related to the mechanisms that induce the bug are identifiable within the provided file context.\n\nThe 'backend_gtk.py' and 'backend_tk.py' files also show similar structures with corresponding functions like 'draw_rubberband', suggesting consistent implementation across different backend technologies. These files contain code for handling GUI events, widget interactions, and drawing operations that are critical for understanding the reported issue. The fact that similar functionality exists across different backends strengthens the case for this being a multi-backend consistent issue potentially rooted in more generic figure updating or event handling, substantiated by parts of the file context. Therefore, given the detailed exposure of backend internals across three main technologies, I consider the provided file context to be relevant and complete for technical diagnosis and investigation of the reported issue.",

When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
