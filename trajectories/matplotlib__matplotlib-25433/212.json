The user observes that input to widgets is blocked when these functions are called within the on_changed callback, whereas the same functions work without issue in the on_clicked callback of a Button widget.\n\nTo address this, we need to examine the code related to the RangeSlider and its callback mechanism. The search results provide insights into the RangeSlider class, specifically focusing on the initialization (`RangeSlider.__init__`), the update mechanism (`RangeSlider._update`), and the callback registration (`RangeSlider.on_changed`).\n\nFurthermore, understanding how clf() and draw() functions interact with the canvas and the widgets is crucial. Both functions are found in the `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` file. clf() clears the current figure, while draw() triggers a redraw of the current figure.\n\nGiven the provided code spans, I will identify the relevant sections that might contribute to or directly impact the issue. This includes the initialization and callback mechanism of the RangeSlider, as well as the clf() and draw() functions in the pyplot module.",

Instead of using `clf()` to clear the figure and `draw()` to redraw it, we can try to manage the figure elements more selectively. The solution could involve clearing only certain elements of the plot (like lines, markers, or other artists) and then re-adding the necessary elements rather than fully clearing and redrawing. This approach should theoretically preserve the interactive elements' ability to receive input.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: using clf and pyplot.draw in range slider on_changed callback blocks input to widgets\n### Bug summary\n\nWhen using clear figure, adding new widgets and then redrawing the current figure in the on_changed callback of a range slider the inputs to all the widgets in the figure are blocked. When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
