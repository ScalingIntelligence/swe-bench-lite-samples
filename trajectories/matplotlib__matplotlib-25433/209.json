Specifically, the problem is that the on_changed callback of a RangeSlider blocks input to other widgets when the figure is cleared and redrawn. The relevant code snippets provided suggest that the issue might lie in how the widget interactions are handled during redraws, particularly in the on_changed callback of the RangeSlider. To address this, we need to investigate the callback functions and how the figure redrawing is managed in the context of these widgets.",

The user has observed that when the figure is cleared and redrawn within the on_changed callback, it blocks input to the widgets, but the same operation in a button's on_clicked callback works fine. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with how the RangeSlider handles its callback events compared to a Button. I have identified the relevant code spans from the search results that are directly related to handling the redraw, clearing the figure, and the callback mechanism of the RangeSlider. Additionally, the backend-specific implementations of the draw method and idle state drawing have been considered in the context of possibly handling events differently.",

The problem arises when these methods are called within the `on_changed` callback of the `RangeSlider`. This interaction might be causing the input to other widgets to be blocked. To further investigate, we should focus on how the `RangeSlider`'s `on_changed` method and the `draw()` method interact.

Processed new search results to find code spans that match the reported issue:\n   - Identified `Button` class and its methods `__init__`, `_click`, `_release`, `_motion`, and `on_clicked` which are relevant since they are part of the comparison between the button's behavior and the range slider.\n4. Considered the entire context of each code section, not just isolated spans, to understand how interactions and redrawing might affect widget input blocking.\n5. Assessed relevance of each code span based on how closely it relates to the reported issue, particularly focusing on the interplay between widget callbacks and figure redrawing.\n6.

When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot\r\nimport matplotlib.widgets as widgets\r\n\r\ndef onchanged(values):\r\n    print(\"on changed\")\r\n    print(values)\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef onclick(e):\r\n    print(\"on click\")\r\n    pyplot.clf()\r\n    addElements()\r\n    pyplot.draw()\r\n\r\ndef addElements():\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global slider\r\n    slider = widgets.RangeSlider(ax, \"Test\", valmin=1, valmax=10, valinit=(1, 10))\r\n    slider.on_changed(onchanged)\r\n    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.30, 0.8, 0.1])\r\n    global button\r\n    button = widgets.Button(ax, \"Test\")\r\n    button.on_clicked(onclick)\r\n\r\naddElements()\r\n\r\npyplot.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nThe widgets can't receive any input from a mouse click, when redrawing in the on_changed callback of a range Slider. \r\nWhen using a button, there is no problem.\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nThe range slider callback on_changed behaves the same as the button callback on_clicked.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe problem also occurred on Manjaro with:\r\n- Python version: 3.10.9\r\n- Matplotlib version: 3.6.2\r\n- Matplotlib backend: QtAgg\r\n- Installation of matplotlib via Linux package manager\r\n\n\n### Operating system\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.2\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nTkAgg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.11.0\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
