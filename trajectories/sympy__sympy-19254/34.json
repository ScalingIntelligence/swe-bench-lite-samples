There are two main methods in the provided search results that are relevant to this issue: `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`. These methods currently implement the Mignotte bound and need to be replaced or updated to implement the Knuth-Cohen bound as per the report. Additionally, there is a wrapper method `IPolys.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` that calls the underlying `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` method, which suggests that this wrapper method might also need an update.\n\nGiven the scope of the change and the need to replace existing methods rather than introducing new ones, the identified spans seem comprehensive for addressing the reported issue. The code spans include all necessary parts like the bound calculation in both dense univariate and multivariate polynomial contexts, as well as the integration point within the `IPolys` class, indicating that these are the primary and sufficient locations for implementing the required changes.
