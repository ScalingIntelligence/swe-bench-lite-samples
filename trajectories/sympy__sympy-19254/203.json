The search results contain both methods in the `sympy/polys/factortools.py` file. These methods are directly related to the issue as they are the targets for replacement. The file context is initially empty, indicating that this is the first pass or step in identifying relevant code for the issue. The search results also include a variety of other methods and imports in the `sympy/polys/factortools.py` and `sympy/polys/compatibility.py` files, but the direct relevance is primarily with the `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` methods. Given the nature of the issue, which specifically mentions these two methods for improvement, the relevant code spans to focus on are those containing these methods. Further, the issue does not suggest a need for additional functions or classes that might not be explicitly mentioned in the reported issue. Reviewing the entire section of code related to these methods ensures a complete understanding before making a decision on relevance and completeness. The search results do not reference parts of the codebase that might be relevant but not found in the search results. However, based on the reported issue and the current search results, the identified code spans are sufficient for the task of implementing the proposed change.

From the provided context, it is clear that `dmp_zz_wang`, a function related to polynomial factorization, uses `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`. Furthermore, examining related modules such as `sympy.polys.sqfreetools` is crucial as changes to core functions could impact these areas. Looking into previous research that involved implementing various bounds in polynomial factorization algorithms could also provide valuable insights and foundational code for integrating the Knuth-Cohen bound effectively.",
