This suggests that the relevant code spans would be those that define or use the existing Mignotte bound methods. After examining the search results, I identified two primary code spans within the 'sympy/polys/factortools.py' file that directly implement the Mignotte bounds for both univariate and multivariate polynomials. These spans are labeled with IDs 'dup_zz_mignotte_bound' and 'dmp_zz_mignotte_bound', respectively. Additionally, in the 'sympy/polys/compatibility.py' file, there are import statements referring to these Mignotte bound functions, which confirm their usage within the codebase. Therefore, these spans are highly relevant to the reported issue as they are the targets for the proposed replacement by the Knuth-Cohen bound. Furthermore, the presence of the Mignotte bound in the 'IPolys' class demonstrates that it is integrated into the larger framework of polynomial manipulations. Since these identified code spans address the core of the issue, and there are no other relevant spans that appear in the search results that would provide additional context or functionality related to the Mignotte bound, I consider the search for relevant code spans complete.",

        "message": "Given the lack of relevant results on the Knuth-Cohen bound in the SymPy codebase and the descriptions provided, it appears that the implementation of the Knuth-Cohen bound, along with any modifications needed for methods like `dmp_zz_wang`, will have to be custom. To proceed, a focused task would involve designing and incorporating the Knuth-Cohen bound into the polynomial factorization workflow within SymPy. This custom addition should ensure that the Knuth-Cohen bound functions as intended and improves the effectiveness of bounds computation in the context of polynomial factorization within the SymPy library. Further, testing would need to be conducted to ensure that this replacement does not introduce new bugs or issues. The testing should involve a comparison of the results and efficiency before and after the integration of the Knuth-Cohen bound; this would necessitate creating test cases that span a range of polynomials including various degrees, coefficients, and structural complexities.",
