The current search results provide the relevant code spans for both methods in the 'factortools.py' file. The methods in question are indeed found in the provided search results, namely the 'dup_zz_mignotte_bound' and 'dmp_zz_mignotte_bound' functions. These functions are used to calculate bounds in polynomial factorization algorithms. The 'compatibility.py' file also imports these functions, which may be used elsewhere in the codebase. To implement the proposed improvement, the identified functions would need to be modified to replace the Mignotte bound calculation with the Knuth-Cohen bound calculation. Based on the provided search results, the relevant code spans have been identified, and there are no additional sections of code linked in the methods that have not been included in the search results.
