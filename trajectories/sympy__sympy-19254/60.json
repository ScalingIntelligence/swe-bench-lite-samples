The search results reveal that both methods are indeed present in the `sympy/polys/factortools.py` file. Additionally, the `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` method is used within the `dmp_zz_wang` method, which indicates that if we replace the Mignotte bound with the Knuth-Cohen bound, it may affect the factorization process of multivariate polynomials. Furthermore, the `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` method is also accessible through the `IPolys` class in the `sympy/polys/compatibility.py` file, which implies that the change might also need to be reflected in the compatibility layer. Given the thorough examinations, the identified spans wholly align with the key aspects discussed in the report. Thus, the provided code spans are relevant and decisive for future integration of the Knuth-Cohen bound.",

After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\r\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n"
