Upon reviewing the file `sympy/polys/factortools.py`, I found both the `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` methods, which are prime candidates for replacement or modification as per the issue. These methods calculate the Mignotte bound for univariate and multivariate polynomials respectively. Understanding that these methods are directly related to the issue at hand, I believe they should be included in the response. Furthermore, I considered the context provided in `sympy/polys/compatibility.py`. Although initially examining this file didn't seem necessary for the specific issue, it is standard to review imports and potential method extensions across files for a comprehensive view when making significant changes like replacing bounds in a library. Given the detailed scrutiny of the relevant methods and their contexts, I am confident that the identified code spans are pertinent to the reported issue.",

After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\r\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n"
