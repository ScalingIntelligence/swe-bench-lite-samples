Analyze User Instructions: The reported issue suggests improving the `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` method in `sympy.polys.factortools` by replacing it with the Knuth-Cohen bound. The issue also mentions that the improvement should apply to both univariate (`dup_zz_mignotte_bound`) and multivariate polynomials (`dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`).\n2. Review Current Context: No relevant code has been identified in the current context.\n3. Process New Search Results:\n  3.1. Analyzed the search results and found two files containing relevant code spans:\n     - `sympy/polys/factortools.py` contains the implementations of `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`.\n     - `sympy/polys/compatibility.py` contains an import and a method wrapper for `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`.\n  3.2. Identified the relevant code spans that directly relate to the methods to be improved.\n  3.3. Thoroughly reviewed the entire content of each section to ensure completeness and relevance.\n4. Conclusion: The identified code spans are sufficient to proceed with implementing the Knuth-Cohen bound as a replacement for the Mignotte bound.\n",

After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\r\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n"
