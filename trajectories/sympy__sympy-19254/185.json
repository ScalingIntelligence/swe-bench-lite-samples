These findings suggest that replacing the current Mignotte bounds with the Knuth-Cohen bound directly involves modifying these specific functions in `factortools.py` and potentially updating any class method implementations in `compatibility.py`.

After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\r\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n"
