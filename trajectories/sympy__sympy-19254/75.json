I analyzed the reported issue and confirmed that the focus is on replacing the `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` functions.\n\n2. In the provided search results, I located the specific code spans that define these functions:\n   - `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` in `sympy/polys/factortools.py`\n   - `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` in `sympy/polys/factortools.py`\n   - `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` in `sympy/polys/compatibility.py` within the `IPolys` class\n\n3. Given that these functions are found in two separate files and that the issue pertains to both uni-variant and multi-variant polynomial treatments indicated, I considered all instances significant. Thus, I included all three instances in the identified spans to provide a comprehensive solution.\n\n4. Additionally, I checked for references to these functions in the current context or additional sections of the codebase that might be relevant but were not included in the search results. As no other contexts were provided, I concluded that these three instances are the primary points of interest for this issue.",
