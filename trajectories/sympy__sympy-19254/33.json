            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue recommends replacing the Mignotte bounds with the Knuth-Cohen bounds for both univariate and multivariate polynomials. Upon careful analysis of the search results, the following key points were identified:\n1. The functions `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` are currently used to calculate the Mignotte bounds for univariate and multivariate polynomials, respectively. These are the exact functions that need to be modified or replaced to incorporate the Knuth-Cohen bound.\n2. The `dmp_zz_wang_non_divisors` function and related code fragments use `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` internally. This indicates that any changes made to these bounds will likely have broader impacts and must be tested in this context.\n3. The code from *compatibility.py* indicates broader use of these bounds across various factorization and evaluation tools, underscoring the critical nature of these changes. The entire section of code involving these bounds must be checked to ensure seamless integration of the proposed changes with existing code.\n4. The *IPolys* class in *compatibility.py* also contains a method `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`, which translates to the core `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` function in *factortools.py*. This further emphasizes the need to manage localized dependencies when modifying or replacing these functions across different modules.\nBased on these observations, it is clear that modifying these bounds for alignment with Knuth-Cohen bounds is of high relevance, complexity, and wide-ranging impact. The identified code spans are essential for implementing the proposed changes.",
