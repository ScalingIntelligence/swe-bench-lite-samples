The issue specifically mentions the need to replace `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` methods. The search results provided contain these methods, which are found in the `sympy/polys/factortools.py` file. These methods are currently using the Mignotte bound and will need to be modified to use the Knuth-Cohen bound as per the issue request. Additionally, in `sympy/polys/compatibility.py`, there are import statements for these methods, which suggests that these methods are used elsewhere in the codebase and should be replaced there as well to ensure consistency. The provided search results are relevant and directly address the issue. The next step would be to replace the Mignotte bound implementation with the Knuth-Cohen bound implementation in the identified methods.",
