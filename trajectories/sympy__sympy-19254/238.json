These implementations align with the reported issue as they define the current Mignotte bound calculations. \n\nAdditionally, there are implementations of these methods in the 'sympy/polys/compatibility.py' file, under the `IPolys` class. These methods wrap the calls to the actual implementations found in 'sympy/polys/factortools.py'. \n\nGiven the alignment of these code spans with the reported issue, I recommend proceeding with the replacement of the Mignotte bound with the Knuth-Cohen bound in these identified methods.",
