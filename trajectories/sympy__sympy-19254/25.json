The search results provide relevant code spans in two files: 'sympy/polys/compatibility.py' and 'sympy/polys/factortools.py'. In 'sympy/polys/factortools.py', we find definitions of `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`, which are the methods that need to be modified according to the issue. Additionally, in 'sympy/polys/compatibility.py', there is a class `IPolys` with methods `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` that call these functions. These methods are relevant because they need to be adjusted once the underlying bound functions are updated.

Next, I reviewed the current file context and focused on the relevant functions `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`. I then proceeded to analyze the new search results to identify any additional relevant code spans. I discovered that the search results include the incomplete implementations of `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` in both `sympy/polys/factortools.py` and `sympy/polys/compatibility.py`. These incomplete functions are crucial for the proposed improvement as they will need to be fully implemented using the Knuth-Cohen bound.

After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\r\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n"
