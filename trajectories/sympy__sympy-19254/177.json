The search results contain the relevant code spans in two files: 'sympy/polys/factortools.py' and 'sympy/polys/compatibility.py'. In 'sympy/polys/factortools.py', the spans 'dup_zz_mignotte_bound' and 'dmp_zz_mignotte_bound' directly implement the current Mignotte bounds. Additionally, the implementation in 'sympy/polys/compatibility.py' includes a method 'IPolys.dmp_zz_mignotte_bound' which wraps the function for integration with the IPolys class. These spans are directly related to the implementation and usage of the Mignotte bound and are thus highly relevant to the issue. Given that the proposed solution involves replacing these implementations with the Knuth-Cohen bound, identifying these spans as relevant is necessary for modifying the current code to incorporate the new bound.

After our research with Prof. Ag.Akritas we have implemented the Knuth-Cohen bound among others, and compare them among dozens of polynomials with different degree, density and coefficients range. Considering the results and the feedback from Mr.Kalevi Suominen, our proposal is that the mignotte_bound should be replaced by the knuth-cohen bound.\r\nAlso, `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` for mutli-variants polynomials should be replaced appropriately.\n"
