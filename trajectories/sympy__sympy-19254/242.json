This indicates the location where the functions are used or referenced within the codebase. The second key span is in 'sympy/polys/factortools.py', where the implementations of `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` are found. These are the exact functions that need to be modified or replaced according to the issue report. Additionally, there is a section in 'sympy/polys/factortools.py' where the `dmp_zz_wang` function uses the Mignotte bound, providing a broader context of where the bound is applied in the factorization process. It is crucial to review and potentially update these sections to implement the Knuth-Cohen bound as per the issue's recommendation.",
