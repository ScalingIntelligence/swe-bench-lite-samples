Additionally, in `sympy/polys/compatibility.py`, the `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` is imported and used in the `IPolys` class which is a wrapper for internal poly functions. These functions and the wrapper should be considered for replacement to integrate the Knuth-Cohen bound functionalities. Given such a context, both files and their respective spans need to be flagged as relevant to go ahead with the required changes. \n\nBased on the evaluation, we have considered not just isolated spans but contextual spans within the code sections where these functions are implemented and used. By assessing the functionality and usage, we can ascertain these sections are intimately connected with the reported issue. We followed this process for all sections and concluded that the identified code spans are significant in addressing the reported issue.
