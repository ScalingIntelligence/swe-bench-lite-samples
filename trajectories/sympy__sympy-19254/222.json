These methods currently implement the Mignotte bound for univariate and multivariate polynomials, respectively. The task is to identify these methods as relevant and consider them as the starting point for implementing the Knuth-Cohen bound. Additionally, the search results include other methods related to polynomial factorization, such as `dmp_zz_wang`, which uses the `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` method. This broader context indicates that changes would need to extend beyond just replacing the bound function, potentially affecting how the new bounds integrate into other factorization processes.",
