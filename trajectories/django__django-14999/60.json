The search results contain relevant code spans in the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file which defines the `RenameModel` class and its methods like `database_forwards` and `database_backwards` that handle the renaming logic. Specifically within `database_forwards`, there is a call to `schema_editor.alter_db_table`, which is the method responsible for altering the database table name. The method in question is found in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` where the `alter_db_table` of `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class is defined, displaying the logic that handles changes to the database table name.
