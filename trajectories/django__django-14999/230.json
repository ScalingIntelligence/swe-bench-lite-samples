The RenameModel class definition and its methods such as `__init__`, `database_forwards`, `database_backwards`, and `describe`. These methods are directly involved in handling model renaming operations and are thus central to the reported issue.\n2. The `AlterModelTable` class and its `database_forwards` method, as they handle table renaming actions, which could influence the behavior of the RenameModel operation.\n3. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class, particularly the `alter_db_table` method, which handles low-level table alteration logic. This is crucial for understanding how table renaming is implemented in different database backends, including Postgres and SQLite.\n4. The `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class in the SQLite backend, specifically its `alter_db_table` method, which customizes the table renaming process for SQLite and could explain the reported behavior.\n\nThese sections of the codebase are analyzed based on their relevance to the reported issue, focusing on how model and table renaming are managed and how different database backends might behave differently in these operations.",

This means that if a RenameModel operation is performed on a model that already has a db_table defined, it should not result in any changes to the database schema. The code analysis reveals that the RenameModel class in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py is responsible for handling model renaming operations. Key methods to focus on are `database_forwards` and `database_backwards`, as these methods implement the logic for how the database schema should be updated when a model is renamed. The analysis also shows that the `alter_db_table` method in the schema editor classes, such as BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor and DatabaseSchemaEditor, is responsible for changing the table name in the database. The issue's requirement for a noop behavior suggests that the `alter_db_table` method should check if the old and new db_table names are the same and if so, it should not execute the table renaming SQL. Additionally, the `database_forwards` method in the RenameModel class should ensure that if the table name does not change, it should not call `alter_db_table`.",
