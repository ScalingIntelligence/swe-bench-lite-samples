The search results provide the RenameModel class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' which seems to directly handle the renaming of models in database migrations. This class includes the methods '__init__', 'database_forwards', and 'database_backwards', all of which are likely relevant to address the issue. The 'database_forwards' method, in particular, contains the logic for applying the renaming operation in the database, which involves altering the db_table and fields to handle renaming correctly. This span of code clearly addresses the core of the reported issue by showing how a model rename is managed by Django's migration operations and is where modifications for making the operation a noop if db_table is already defined would be implemented.",
