This means that if a model's `db_table` is already defined, the renaming operation should not execute any database alterations, particularly avoiding dropping and recreating foreign key constraints in Postgres and avoiding table recreation in SQLite.\n\nAfter analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are located in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file. Specifically, the 'RenameModel' class and its methods 'database_forwards' and 'database_backwards' are key. These methods handle the renaming of models and their related foreign key constraints, which aligns with the issue. In the 'database_forwards' method, the `schema_editor.alter_db_table` call is crucial as it manages the actual table renaming, and understanding how it interacts with `db_table` is essential for resolving the issue.\n\nAdditionally, checking the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' and the overridden 'alter_db_table' method in 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py' provides insight into how the `db_table` renaming is handled specifically for SQLite. Both of these implementations must ensure that renaming a table with `db_table` already set does not lead to undesired database alterations.\n\nThese code spans provide the necessary context to understand and potentially modify the behavior of RenameModel operations when `db_table` is already defined.",
