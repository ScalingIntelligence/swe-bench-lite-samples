Given the provided context, it's likely that the logic for handling RenameModel operations, including the behavior when db_table is already set, resides in the RenameModel class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. Additionally, the 'database_forwards' and 'database_backwards' methods in the RenameModel class may contain the code that decides the noop or other actions based on the db_table attribute. Due to differences in how databases handle schema changes, specific backend files such as 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py' and 'django/db/backends/postgres/schema.py' may also need to be checked, particularly their 'alter_db_table' methods.",

The search results provide several relevant classes and methods in the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file, including `RenameModel` and `AlterModelTable`. These classes and methods handle database schema changes and are potentially relevant to the issue. Specifically, the methods `database_forwards` and `database_backwards` within the `RenameModel` class are used to manage the renaming process in the database schema. The `AlterModelTable` class, although not directly related to renaming models, deals with altering the database table which could be relevant context for understanding the behavior described in the issue. It is worth noting that the issue specifies the behavior in Postgres and SQLite databases, and the provided code does not directly address these database-specific behaviors but does provide the foundational logic for managing model and table changes. Further investigation may be needed to fully understand and implement a no-op behavior for RenameModel operations with `db_table` defined in Postgres and SQLite, potentially involving additional checks within the `database_forwards` and `database_backwards` methods.",

This means that when a RenameModel operation is performed on a model that already has a db_table defined, it should not result in any database changes, effectively doing nothing. The issue specifically mentions problems in Postgres and SQLite regarding foreign key constraints and table recreation during such operations.\n\nIn the provided file context, we already have relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. The 'RenameModel' class is defined here and contains methods like 'database_forwards' and 'database_backwards', which handle renaming a model in the database. The 'database_forwards' method is particularly relevant as it checks conditions and uses 'schema_editor.alter_db_table' to perform the rename.\n\nIn the search results, we find additional context in 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py' and 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py'. These files contain the 'DatabaseSchemaEditor' and 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' classes, respectively, which define the 'alter_db_table' method. This method is crucial for actually renaming the table in the database, and it contains logic to handle changes like constraint checking.\n\nThe 'SpatialiteSchemaEditor' in 'django/contrib/gis/db/backends/spatialite/schema.py' extends 'DatabaseSchemaEditor' and also includes an 'alter_db_table' method, suggesting Spatialite-specific handling for renaming tables.\n\nGiven the issue, the primary focus is on understanding how 'alter_db_table' is implemented across different database backends to ensure that renaming a model with an already defined 'db_table' does not inadvertently change the database schema. The identified code spans provide deep insights into this behavior across different database types.\n\nBased on the analysis so far, the search results complement the initial file context by providing backend-specific implementations of schema editing. The identified code spans are consistent with the reported issue and provide the necessary context to understand how table renaming works in different database environments, including handling foreign key constraints. This should help in determining whether the 'RenameModel' operation is indeed a noop when 'db_table' is already defined.",
