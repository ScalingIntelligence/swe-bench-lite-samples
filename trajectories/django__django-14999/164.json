The issue specifically mentions that in Postgres, it drops and recreates foreign key constraints, and in SQLite, it recreates the table, which is not the expected behavior for a table renaming operation.\n\nUpon examining the search results, I find that the `RenameModel` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` is likely the key point of interest since it contains methods related to model renaming operations. The methods `database_forwards` and `database_backwards` are crucial as they define what actions are taken when migrating the database forward or backward, respectively. Specifically, `database_forwards` method in the `RenameModel` class deals with altering the database table and the foreign key constraints. The `alter_db_table` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is also important because it shows how the table renaming is handled in SQLite, which aligns with the issue's concern regarding SQLite's behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the `ProjectState.rename_model` method in `django/db/migrations/state.py` is relevant because it manages the state of the models during the renaming process, including adjusting references to the model being renamed. This ensures that all references to the old model are updated to the new model.\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant code spans are identified in the `RenameModel` class for the database operations and in `ProjectState.rename_model` for the state management during the model renaming process. These spans contain the code that needs to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that the RenameModel operation with db_table defined is indeed a noop.",
