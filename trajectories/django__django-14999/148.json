This implies that the operation should not make changes to the database if the table name is already specified. The relevant files and classes appear to be in the migrations and schema editor modules. Specifically, the RenameModel class in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py and its interactions with schema editors in django/db/backends/*/schema.py need to be investigated to ensure the noop behavior. Additionally, ProjectState in django/db/migrations/state.py might handle state changes that could be influencing this behavior. The MigrationAutodetector in django/db/migrations/autodetector.py could also be where automatic detection of model renaming takes place, affecting how the operation is handled. Since no files have been found yet, it's targeted to directly look into the RenameModel class and its interactions within the specified file patterns.",

The RenameModel class in 'models.py' directly handles the renaming of models and interacts with schema editors to perform database operations. Additionally, the 'schema.py' files in 'base', 'sqlite3', and 'spatialite' backends show implementations of the 'alter_db_table' method, which is crucial for handling table renaming across different database systems. This confirms that the necessary code for handling the RenameModel operation across various database backends is present. The implementation in 'models.py' and the specific backend handling in 'schema.py' suggest that the noop behavior for the RenameModel operation (when db_table is already defined) might be influenced by how 'alter_db_table' is implemented and invoked within the RenameModel's 'database_forwards' method. The provided context seems to cover the main areas needed to address the issue of ensuring that RenameModel with db_table defined is a noop. Further investigation into how 'alter_db_table' handles the noop scenario specifically in each backend might be necessary to fully confirm the noop behavior across all backends.",

The SQLite implementation already seems to have a condition that checks if the old and new table names are the same before proceeding with the alteration. The Spatialite implementation adds extra handling for geometry fields, but it also uses `super().alter_db_table` which points back to the base implementation in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`. For completeness, it might be beneficial to check other backends like PostgreSQL and MySQL as well, though the base implementation appears to handle the noop scenario.
