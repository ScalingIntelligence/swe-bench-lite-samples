These methods deal with how the model is renamed in the state and in the database. Additionally, 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' and its subclass 'DatabaseSchemaEditor' in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' and 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py' respectively, contain implementations of how tables are renamed in the database, which could affect foreign key constraints. The 'ProjectState' class in 'django/db/migrations/state.py' contains methods related to manipulating the project state, such as rename_model, which is crucial for updating references to the renamed model.
