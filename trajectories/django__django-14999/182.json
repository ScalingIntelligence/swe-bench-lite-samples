The issue indicates that specific database behaviors, such as dropping and recreating foreign key constraints in PostgreSQL or recreating the table in SQLite, need to be adjusted to ensure RenameModel operations are effectively no-operations when db_table is defined. The provided search results contain three key files: models.py, schema.py for SQLite, and schema.py for the base database. Within models.py, the RenameModel class and its methods database_forwards and database_backwards are identified as relevant. These methods control how the database schema changes are executed during the migration, which is crucial for determining whether RenameModel can be made a noop. Additionally, the alter_db_table method in the DatabaseSchemaEditor for SQLite and BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor is significant, as it defines the behavior of renaming a table, which is directly related to the issue of avoiding unintended schema changes. The analysis of these code spans indicates that modifying the behavior of these methods to check for and respect existing db_table definitions could address the reported issue.",

Additionally, the SQLite and base schema editor implementations are examined for their handling of table renaming, which directly relates to the behavior under inspection for this issue.

It is assumed that such a check might be within the methods provided but not explicitly shown.
