The search results provide relevant code spans from Django's migration operations and schema editor classes. These spans include the RenameModel class definition and its methods, as well as the AlterModelTable class which is related to altering model tables. Additionally, the schema editor classes for different database backends (like SQLite and Spatialite) provide insights into how table alterations are handled in different databases. The key spans to focus on are those that involve the RenameModel class and its methods (especially `__init__`, `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, and `database_backwards`), and the AlterModelTable class and its methods. These spans are crucial for understanding the current behavior of the RenameModel operation and for making necessary changes to ensure it is a noop when db_table is already defined.

These files contain classes and methods like `RenameModel`, `AlterModelTable`, and `alter_db_table`, which are directly involved in model operations and schema changes. The `RenameModel` class includes methods such as `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, and `database_backwards`, which are crucial for implementing the no-op behavior for RenameModel operations with `db_table` defined. The `alter_db_table` method in the schema editors is also relevant as it handles table renaming and altering.
