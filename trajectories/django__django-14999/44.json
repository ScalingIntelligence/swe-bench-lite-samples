This behavior needs to be verified and possibly adjusted for both Postgres and SQLite. The provided context includes several relevant files and classes such as RenameModel in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, which suggests it's the main place to look for code handling model renaming. Additionally, the `database_forwards` and `database_backwards` methods in RenameModel seem critical as they handle the actual migration logic for forwards and backwards migrations. Other files like `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`, and `django/db/migrations/state.py` also appear relevant, particularly for handling database schemas and migration states.",

This means the operation should not make any changes to the database in the context of Postgres and SQLite. The issue specifically points out the current behavior where Postgres drops and recreates foreign key constraints, and SQLite recreates the table upon renaming. This indicates the need to identify the relevant code that handles these operations in Django's migration framework.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant sections of code. In `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, the `RenameModel` class and its methods are particularly relevant. The `database_forwards` method is where the actual database alterations occur when renaming a model. This method could be a critical point to modify so that no changes are made if the `db_table` is already defined. Similarly, `database_backwards` is also relevant as it handles the reverse operations.\n\nIn `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class contains the `alter_db_table` method which is central to handling table renaming. This method currently checks if the table names are different before performing any operations, suggesting a potential point to enhance to make it a noop if certain conditions are met.\n\nFor SQLite in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`, `DatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_db_table` handles table renaming with additional logic to handle constraints and atomicity. This section is particularly relevant to ensure that the table is not recreated, aligning with the no-op requirement.\n\nThese findings suggest that modifications to the `database_forwards` and `alter_db_table` methods in the identified files are key to implementing the desired behavior of the RenameModel operation being a no-op when the `db_table` is already defined.",
