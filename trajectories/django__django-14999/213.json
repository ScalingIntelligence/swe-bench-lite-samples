This involves investigating how RenameModel is handled across different databases (Postgres, SQLite) and ensuring it doesn't drop and recreate foreign key constraints in Postgres and doesn't recreate the table in SQLite. Relevant files include those defining ModelOperation, CreateModel, DeleteModel, and specifically RenameModel in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. Additionally, the schema editor classes for SQLite and PostgreSQL need to be reviewed to understand their handling of `alter_db_table` and `alter_field` methods. The `django/db/backends/*/schema.py` files and the `django/db/migrations/state.py` file are likely to contain relevant code.",

The issue states that a RenameModel operation with db_table defined should be a noop (no operation), meaning it should not perform any changes. We also need to consider how different database backends handle this operation, as the issue mentions specific behaviors in Postgres and SQLite.\n\nSteps taken to identify relevant code spans:\n1. Examine the RenameModel class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' to understand how it initializes and handles the renaming process.\n2. Look specifically at the 'database_forwards' and 'database_backwards' methods of RenameModel to see how it interacts with the schema editor and handles changes to the db_table.\n3. Review the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' to understand how the 'alter_db_table' method works.\n4. Check the specific implementations of 'DatabaseSchemaEditor' in SQLite ('django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py') and other databases to see if there are any special handling or constraints applied when renaming tables.\n\nThe key spans identified are the methods handling the renaming process in both the RenameModel class and the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class, as these manage the core functionality related to the db_table attribute during a model rename.",

The current file context already provides relevant code spans from `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. Examining the new search results from `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`, the `DatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_db_table` method appears to be relevant as it handles table renaming in SQLite. However, the current implementation still seems to alter the table, which contradicts the requirement for a no-op operation. The `alter_field` method is also relevant for similar reasons. Therefore, the identified spans are primarily from `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` where the actual database schema alteration logic resides.
