The search results clearly indicate the existence of the RenameModel class within Django's migration operations. The critical method here is 'database_forwards' which handles the actual renaming of a model in the database. The method modifies the db_table name of the model and also performs alterations on related fields and many-to-many fields. This directly addresses the concern since it shows how the operation could lead to dropping and recreating constraints or tables, which should ideally be prevented if the db_table is already defined.
