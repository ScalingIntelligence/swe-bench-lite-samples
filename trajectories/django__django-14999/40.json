The provided search results from `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` include the definition of the `RenameModel` class and its methods which handle the renaming of models and their associated foreign key constraints. Specifically, the `database_forwards` method contains logic that could be relevant, as it is responsible for applying changes to the database schema. Additionally, the `alter_db_table` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` is also relevant as it directly handles the renaming of database tables. Furthermore, the `alter_db_table` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` and `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py` are relevant as they provide backend-specific handling of table renaming, and the issue mentions different behaviors in Postgres, Sqlite, and potentially other databases.
