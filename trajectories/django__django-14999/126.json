It mentions specific behaviors in Postgres and SQLite databases. It's crucial to investigate the RenameModel class and its methods, particularly the database_forwards and database_backwards methods, to understand how the operation interacts with the database schemas. The issue also suggests looking into other relevant classes like AlterModelTable and possibly the schema editors for Postgres and SQLite for a deeper understanding of how table renaming is handled and to check for potential redundancies or unnecessary operations. Additionally, it would be beneficial to review the migration operations and the ProjectState class to ensure that state changes align with the desired noop behavior for RenameModel operations.",
