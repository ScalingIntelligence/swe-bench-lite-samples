The key areas of interest in this issue are the pickling and unpickling processes, specifically how the DPI is handled during these operations. The search results contain relevant code spans from 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py'. In 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py', the '__init__' and '__setstate__' methods are relevant for understanding how the figure is initialized and how state is set upon unpickling. The '__setstate__' method specifically deals with restoring the state of the figure, which could be where the DPI doubling issue originates. Additionally, in 'lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py', the 'FigureCanvasMac' class and its methods, such as 'resize', are relevant as they handle figure rendering and resizing, which could interact with DPI settings.

This traceback shows that the error occurs when initializing the FigureCanvasMac class. Given that the backtrace mentions the '__setstate__' method in the Figure class, it's crucial to examine how the DPI value is being handled during the unpickling process. The search results do not directly address the doubling of DPI but do provide context on how the 'FigureCanvasMac' class manages its Figure instance. Notably, 'FigureCanvasMac' includes methods for managing resizing and drawing, which could indirectly be implicated in the DPI handling during the unpickling process. The currently identified relevant spans in 'figure.py' regarding the '__init__' and '__setstate__' methods of the Figure class are crucial, but the additional context from 'backend_macosx.py' is also necessary to get a full understanding of how DPI is managed on M1 Macs after unpickling.

Key to solving this issue are the '__setstate__' method in the 'Figure' class of 'matplotlib/figure.py' and the 'resize' method in the 'FigureCanvasMac' class of 'matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py'. The '__setstate__' method is crucial as it handles the restoration of a figure's state after unpickling, potentially where the DPI doubling occurs. The 'resize' method, though not directly causing the issue, could indicate how DPI adjustments are handled in the Mac OS X backend, providing insights into potential scaling factors or processing differences on M1 Macs. Additionally, considering the issue's specific occurrence on M1 Macs suggests a direct examination of code execution paths and object handling unique to this architecture within the given code spans might be necessary to pinpoint the bug's source.",
