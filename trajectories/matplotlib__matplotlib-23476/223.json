The relevant code involves the `pickle` module and the `matplotlib` library, specifically the `Figure` class and its methods for pickling and unpickling. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs in `matplotlib/figure.py` when setting the state of the figure. I should focus my search on the `Figure` class methods `__setstate__` and `__getstate__`, and ensure that the DPI values are correctly handled during these operations.",
