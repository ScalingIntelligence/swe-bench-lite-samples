The issue seems to be rooted in the '__setstate__' method of the 'Figure' class within matplotlib, potentially related to how the figure is recreated or the DPI is re-assigned after being unpickled. By analyzing the 'Figure' class, we can identify specific relevant code spans that handle the DPI assignment and figure restoration. The critical spans include 'Figure.__init__', where the DPI is initially set, and 'Figure.__setstate__', where the figure's state is restored after unpickling. These spans are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the issue, as they relate directly to the initialization and restoration process of the figure, including the handling of its DPI attribute. Given that the issue occurs on M1 Macs, it might involve platform-specific code related to figure management or backend-specific elements. However, the provided code spans do not explicitly show backend-specific handling within the '__setstate__' method, suggesting that the problem could lie deeper in the backend implementation or its interaction with the figure upon deserialization.",

The initial search results include several relevant spans such as 'Figure.__init__' and 'Figure.__setstate__', which handle setting initial attributes when creating a figure and restoring the state of a figure when unpickled, respectively. Further, the provided context shows that both 'Figure.__init__' and 'Figure.__setstate__' have been identified as relevant. Additional spans such as 'Figure.__getstate__' and the _print_figure methods in various backends might be relevant as they handle the state and printing of the figure. The search results also include other spans like 'imsave', 'savefig', and various backends' printing methods, which might indirectly relate to the figure's DPI handling. However, the most direct relationship to the issue appears in the 'Figure.__setstate__' method where the figure's state is being restored, likely affecting the DPI value.

This behavior is specifically tied to the M1 MacBooks and involves the interaction of figure unpickling and DPI handling. The current file context includes sections of `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` related to figure initialization and DPI setting, as well as unpickling state restoration. The provided search results from `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` show the Mac-specific backend implementation for figure canvas management and handling resizes. These sections are relevant as they deal with how figures are managed and displayed on Mac OS, which is crucial for understanding and fixing the reported issue. Given the issue's nature, it's important to focus on the DPI related aspects in the provided code spans, especially the sections where DPI is set or modified during figure creation and state management. This will help in identifying where the DPI doubling might be happening due to the interaction between the backend and the figure management in the context of M1 Macs.",
