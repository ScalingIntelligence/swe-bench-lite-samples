The search results include several code spans from the 'figure.py' file in the matplotlib library. The relevant code spans are those dealing with the initialization and state management of the Figure class, particularly those that involve the DPI setting and the unpickling process. The '__init__' method is crucial as it initializes the DPI of the figure, and the '__setstate__' method is also relevant because it handles the reinitialization of the figure after unpickling. These methods are likely places where the DPI doubling issue could be introduced or addressed. Therefore, these two spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
