            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a bug where the DPI of a figure is doubled after unpickling on an M1 MacBook. This leads to an `OverflowError` in a loop. The key components to focus on are the unpickling process, the handling of DPI, and the interaction with the backend on macOS. Analysis of the provided search results reveals several relevant code spans:\n\n1. In `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, the `Figure` class and its methods cover the initialization and manipulation of a figure, including setting and getting the DPI. Specifically, the `__init__` method initializes the DPI and the `_set_dpi` method is responsible for updating the DPI. Additionally, the `__setstate__` method is relevant as it handles the state when the figure is unpickled. This method could potentially influence the DPI after the figure is loaded.\n\n2. The `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` file contains the `FigureManagerMac` and `NavigationToolbar2Mac` classes, which deal with the management of figures and the interaction with the macOS backend. While these classes primarily focus on the user interface aspects, they are indirectly related to the issue as they involve the macOS backend and could influence how figures are displayed, potentially affecting DPI.\n\n3. The `__setstate__` methods in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` and `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py` might also be relevant if they influence the state of figures or axes during the unpickling process. However, direct relevance to the DPI issue might be less pronounced compared to the figure module.\n\nBased on these findings, the relevant files and code spans should include those in the figure module for understanding and potentially fixing the DPI doubling bug after unpickling.",

Additionally, the `_set_dpi` method and the figure initialization code, where DPI settings are managed, are also found. In `backend_macosx.py`, the FigureManagerMac class, which is linked to figure handling on macOS, is present.
