The provided file context includes relevant code spans from the `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` file, specifically focusing on the `Figure` class and its `__init__` and `__setstate__` methods. The `__init__` method initializes the figure with the specified or default DPI, while the `__setstate__` method handles the unpickling and restoration of the figure state. This matches the issue description where the DPI is doubling during unpickling.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context from other parts of the codebase: `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py` and `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py`. In `backend_bases.py`, the `_Backend.new_figure_manager_given_figure` method is relevant as it creates a new figure manager for the given figure, potentially involving the backend's handling of figures. In `backend_macosx.py`, the `FigureCanvasMac` class and its `__init__` and `resize` methods are relevant, particularly the `resize` method which adjusts the figure's size in inches based on the DPI and device pixel ratio. This could be a potential area where the DPI scaling issue arises due to differences in handling on M1 Macs.\n\nGiven the provided context, the identified code spans in the `figure.py` file are relevant to the DPI issue, and the additional spans in `backend_bases.py` and `backend_macosx.py` provide deeper insight into the backend-specific handling of figures.

The DPI doubles each time the figure is unpickled in a loop, eventually leading to an OverflowError. The key point of interest is the interaction between the unpickling process and the DPI attribute in the context of M1 Macs. From the provided code and context, the critical sections are the `__setstate__` method in `Figure` class and the `resize` method in `FigureCanvasMac` class. The `__setstate__` method is responsible for restoring the state when the figure is unpickled, and it involves creating a new figure manager which could potentially influence the DPI. The `resize` method in `FigureCanvasMac` specifically deals with resizing the figure and involves calculations based on DPI and device pixel ratio, which might contribute to the DPI doubling issue on M1 Macs. Therefore, the identified spans ['Figure.__setstate__', 'FigureCanvasMac.resize'] are relevant to the reported issue as they directly deal with the DPI attribute and resizing operations in a Mac-specific backend.",
