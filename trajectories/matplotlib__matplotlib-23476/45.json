The code provided points to specific methods and subroutines in matplotlib used for pickling and unpickling figures, notably the `dump_load_get_dpi` function. I then examined the search results, focusing on the spans of code related to these functionalities. \n\nFrom `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, I identified the spans `Figure.__init__` and `Figure.__setstate__` as highly relevant. These spans include the initialization and state setting logic for a Figure object, including handling of DPI-related properties. The `__setstate__` method is particularly relevant as it describes how a figure should be reconstructed when unpickled. This method might be where the DPI doubling issue occurs, as it involves restoring saved state, including DPI values.\n\nAdditionally, from `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py`, I noted `FigureCanvasMac.__init__` and `FigureCanvasMac.resize` as potentially relevant spans. Although these more directly deal with the canvas initialization and resizing, they might indirectly contribute to the issue as they handle aspects of figure display and transformation, possibly involving DPI settings in a manner specific to the Mac OS backend. \n\nBased on the alignment of these spans with the key elements of the reported issue, I conclude that they are relevant to understanding or addressing the double DPI issue.",
