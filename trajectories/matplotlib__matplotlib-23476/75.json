The provided search results include code spans from 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py', specifically focusing on the 'Figure' class, its '__init__' method, and '__setstate__' method. The '__init__' method initializes the Figure with properties like 'figsize', 'dpi', 'facecolor', etc., and sets up various transformations and callbacks. The '__setstate__' method is responsible for restoring the state of a figure after it has been unpickled. This method is crucial as it directly handles the unpickling process, making it a prime suspect for the issue. The '__setstate__' method restores the figure's properties, including potentially its 'dpi', and reinitializes the FigureCanvasBase. Given the nature of the bug, it seems likely that the issue occurs during the state restoration in '__setstate__', possibly leading to the doubling of the 'dpi' value. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue, as they directly handle the figure's initialization and state restoration processes.",
