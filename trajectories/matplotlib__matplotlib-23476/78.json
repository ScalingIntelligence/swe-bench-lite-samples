The code provided includes a method `dump_load_get_dpi` that pickles and unpickles a figure iteratively. The expected outcome is that the DPI remains constant, but in reality, it doubles after each unpickling. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in `matplotlib.figure.Figure.__setstate__` during the unpickling process.\n\nIn the search results, two files are relevant: `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` and `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py`. The first file contains the definition of the `Figure` class, which includes methods such as `__init__`, `__setstate__`, and `add_axobserver`. The `__setstate__` method is of particular interest as it is responsible for restoring the state of the figure upon unpickling and matches the location indicated in the traceback. Key aspects of this method involve setting up the figure canvas and restoring the figure's internal state to an active state. Additionally, the `__init__` method initializes figure properties, including `dpi`, which is set according to the `matplotlib`'s configuration parameters.\n\nThere is also a section in the `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` file defining the `FigureCanvasMac` class and associated methods. This file is pertinent because it handles the backend-specific interactions with the Mac OS X interface, indicating potential DPI handling and display issues unique to M1 Macs. The `__init__` method of this class sets up properties related to drawing and idle states.\n\nGiven these elements, the most relevant code spans are those in the `Figure` class' `__init__` and `__setstate__` methods within `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, as they directly handle DPI and unpickling processes. It is worth noting that the `FigureCanvasMac` class in `backend_macosx.py` should be carefully reviewed or expanded search could reveal more context on how DPI is managed during canvas operations specific to Mac OS X.",
