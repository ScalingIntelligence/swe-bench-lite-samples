            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the unintended doubling of the DPI of a figure after unpickling on M1 Macs, which leads to an `OverflowError` due to the exponential increase in DPI values over multiple iterations. The investigation of the code spans provided in <search_results> focuses on identifying sections of the codebase that handle figure initialization, DPI setting, and the unpickling process. Specifically, the code related to the `Figure.__init__` and `Figure.__setstate__` methods in the `matplotlib/figure.py` file is relevant. The `__init__` method initializes the figure with specified or default DPI values, which is fundamental to understanding how DPI might be manipulated or incorrectly set during the pickle and unpickle cycle. The `__setstate__` method is directly involved in the unpickling process when figures are restored, and any anomalies in this method could explain the observed doubling of DPI values. Furthermore, understanding how the backend handles new figure managers with a given figure, as seen in the `_Backend.new_figure_manager_given_figure` method in `matplotlib/backend_bases.py`, is crucial, as the backend plays a significant role in managing the display parameters of the figure, potentially including DPI settings. These sections of the code direct attention to the precise locations where the DPI doubling issue might originate and where potential fixes could be applied to ensure that DPI values remain consistent after unpickling. This analysis involves detailed scrutiny of how DPI is handled from initialization through to the restoration process in the unpickling sequence, targeting the specific components of the codebase that orchestrate these functionalities.",

The provided code demonstrates a loop where the figure is repeatedly pickled and unpickled, showing the DPI incrementing exponentially. The key elements to focus on would be the pickle and unpickle operations, the handling of the DPI in the `Figure` class, and any specific backend processing related to figures on macOS. From the current file context, we have relevant code spans in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` including the `Figure.__init__`, `Figure._set_dpi`, `Figure.get_dpi`, `Figure.set_dpi`, and `Figure.__setstate__` methods. These handle setting the DPI, modifying it, and restoring the figure's state, including DPI during unpickling. The additional file context from `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py` includes the `_Backend.new_figure_manager_given_figure` method which is involved in managing figures. In the new search results, the file `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` contains several relevant sections, particularly the `FigureCanvasMac.__init__`, `FigureCanvasMac.draw`, `FigureCanvasMac.draw_idle`, and `FigureCanvasMac.resize` methods. These sections handle drawing, managing idle state, and resizing figure elements, which could impact how the DPI is handled or altered post-unpickling on macOS. It appears that the increased DPI might be related to how the figure's state is managed during these complex drawing or resizing operations specific to the macOS backend. More analysis of these interactions would be beneficial in determining a root cause.",

Looking closely at the code, particularly the `__setstate__` method in the `Figure` class, there doesn't appear to be any obvious manipulation of the DPI that could cause it to double. However, the method does call `FigureCanvasBase(self)`, which might trigger some backend-specific handling of the DPI. Therefore, a deeper inspection of the interaction between the `__setstate__` method and the backend's handling of the DPI is necessary to identify the root cause of the DPI doubling.",
            "search_suggestions": "Additional code or context related to the backend-specific handling of the DPI in the `FigureCanvasBase` class and its subclasses might provide more insight into how the DPI is being manipulated during unpickling."
