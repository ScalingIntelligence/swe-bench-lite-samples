The key aspects to consider from the issue are the interaction between figure creation, pickling, and unpickling. The provided code snippet shows the creation of a figure, its pickling, and subsequent unpickling, which results in the DPI being doubled each time. This suggests a potential problem in the state handling or the unpickling process specifically on M1 Macs. Given this, the relevant code spans identified from the search results should include those related to the Figure class's initialization, DPI setting, and pickling/unpickling mechanisms to understand how DPI is being handled. The search results include the __init__ method of the Figure class where DPI is initially set and the _set_dpi method which adjusts the DPI. Additionally, the FigureCanvasMac class's resize method, while not directly related to DPI, interacts with the figure size and might be relevant in the context of DPI issues. These code spans are critical to grasp how DPI is managed throughout these processes.",
