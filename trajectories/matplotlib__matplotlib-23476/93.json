Key elements to focus on include the handling of the figure's DPI during initialization, unpickling, and the backend-specific behavior on macOS.\n\n1. Analyzing User Instructions:\n   - The user reports that after unpickling a figure, its DPI is doubled, causing an issue specifically on M1 Macs.\n\n2. Reviewing Current Context:\n   - The current file context provided is `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, which includes initializations and state management (getstate and setstate) of the `Figure` class. Specifically, it shows how DPI is set and how the figure is handled during unpickling.\n\n3. Processing New Search Results:\n   - The new search results include two files: `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` and an additional part of `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`.\n   - In `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py`, the `FigureCanvasMac` class and its methods such as `__init__`, `draw`, `draw_idle`, and `resize` are found. These methods are relevant as they might affect how figures are rendered and resized on macOS, potentially influencing DPI handling.\n   - Additional spans in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` (not part of the provided file context) also include methods like `_set_dpi`, `set_figwidth`, and `set_figheight`, which directly deal with DPI and figure size.\n\nBy examining these code spans, it can be inferred that the double DPI issue might be related to how DPI is managed during figure creation, specifically in the backend handling (macOS specific) and during the unpickling process in `Figure.__setstate__`. The key spans to focus on are those dealing directly with DPI settings and the unpickling process, as these are likely to contain the root cause of the issue.\n\nThus, based on the analysis, the relevant spans include code handling DPI in both the figure class and the macOS backend, suggesting that the issue might involve a combination of how DPI is interpreted in the macOS backend and how it is restored during unpickling.",

Reviewing the provided context, the 'Figure' class includes the '__setstate__' method where the figure is being reconstructed after unpickling. Despite the method setting the figure up for restoration, it doesn't explicitly alter the DPI value. The DPI is set during the figure's initialization in the '__init__' method and is managed through the '_set_dpi' method in relation to resizing the figure. None of these methods appear to directly cause a doubling of the DPI. Given the specifics of the issue, it seems critical to investigate further into how the state is being managed and how figure properties might be inconsistently reconstructed between machines with different architectures. Possible areas of concern include the '_set_dpi' method and the '__setstate__' method. I propose to modify the '__setstate__' method to ensure that the DPI value is explicitly set to a known good value before completing the figure initialization to prevent unintended side effects from influencing the DPI setting.",
