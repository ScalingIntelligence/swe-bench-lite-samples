We need to focus on the file where figure unpickling is handled and the function where the figure's DPI is set. The code provided in the issue points to the 'dump_load_get_dpi' function and shows a stack trace that leads to 'matplotlib/figure.py'. Therefore, 'figure.py' is likely the primary file of interest. Additionally, the 'OverflowError' occurs in 'backend_macosx.py', indicating that this file also needs examination, particularly around the handling of figure canvases and DPI. We should search for the '__setstate__' method in 'figure.py' and any related methods or functions that manipulate DPI or handle figure attributes during serialization/deserialization. Also, we should take note of the 'FigureCanvasMac' class and other related classes in 'backend_macosx.py' to understand how the backend interacts with the figure attributes on M1 Macs.",

After analyzing the provided search results, the most relevant code spans are those handling the unpickling process in the 'Figure' class: 'Figure.__setstate__'.

The key parts of the issue are the unpickling process and the handling of the figure's DPI during this process. The code provided for reproduction shows that the DPI is being doubled after each unpickling in a loop, leading to the overflow. The expected behavior is that the DPI should remain constant.\n\nExamining the current context and the search results, several relevant parts of the codebase are identified:\n1. The `Figure` class in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` is responsible for creating figures and includes the `__init__` and `__setstate__` methods. The `__init__` method initializes the figure with a given DPI, and the `__setstate__` method handles the unpickling of the figure.\n2. The `FigureCanvasMac` class in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` is responsible for the Mac-specific backend implementation and includes methods for drawing the figure and handling events.\n3. The `SubFigure` class in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` is a subclass of `FigureBase` and deals with subfigures.\n\nGiven the issue, the focus should be on the `Figure.__setstate__` method, which is the point where the unpickling process is handled. The search task is likely complete as the relevant code spans have been identified, including the initialization and unpickling mechanisms for the Figure class, which are directly related to the reported issue.",

There is a mention of '__setstate__' in the 'Figure' class, but it does not show the exact code causing the DPI to double.

The key elements to focus on are the `dpi` attribute of the figure and the unpickling process. Examining the provided search results, it's clear that the `Figure` class in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` is central to this issue as it handles figure initialization, DPI setting, and the unpickling process. We can see the lifecycle of DPI setting in the `__init__` method of the `Figure` class where `dpi` is initially set and manipulated. Furthermore, the `__setstate__` method is crucial as it is responsible for restoring the state of a figure after it has been unpickled. The specific concern seems to be the handling of the DPI attribute during this restoration process. Based on the annotations, it appears that the issue might be arising from some calculation or assumption made about the DPI when the figure is reconstructed within the `__setstate__` method. This method involves recreating the figure in its original context (possibly through a manager) which might not restore the DPI correctly, leading to the observed doubling effect. Given this analysis, the identified spans in `figure.py` is relevant as they directly touch on the areas of code involved in the DPI management and figure state restoration, which are central to resolving this DPI doubling issue.",
