This suggests a problem in the pickle handling or the DPI setting mechanism upon unpickling. Given that the error occurs in the `__setstate__` method of the `Figure` class in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, it is crucial to first examine this code. Additionally, the error traceback points to `backend_macosx.py`, indicating that the backend handling for Mac OS might also be relevant. Since the issue is specific to M1 Macs, focusing on these files will help identify where the DPI is being incorrectly adjusted or how the unpickling process might be failing.",

In `figure.py`, the `Figure` class handles figure initialization and state setting, including the `__setstate__` method that is critical for unpickling. This method is directly relevant to the issue as it manages the figure's state after unpickling. In `backend_macosx.py`, the `FigureCanvasMac` class, which is specific to the Mac backend, is also relevant as it handles the rendering and resizing of figures, possibly interacting with the DPI during these operations. The identified spans include the `Figure.__init__` and `Figure.__setstate__` methods, which are directly involved in the DPI setting and state restoration after unpickling. Additionally, the `FigureCanvasMac.__init__` and `FigureCanvasMac.resize` methods are relevant for understanding how the canvas and figure interact on MacOS.

Additionally, the `FigureCanvasMac` class in `backend_macosx.py` is relevant as it handles the canvas for the Mac OS backend, which is where the error is occurring. However, the `__setstate__` method seems to be missing the initialization of the `dpi_scale_trans` attribute, which might be causing the DPI to double during unpickling. This suggests that the actual code snippet setting up the DPI may be in another part of the codebase.

I recognized the need to focus on the `__setstate__` method in the `Figure` class as it is responsible for restoring the state of the figure, which is likely where the issue occurs when the figure is unpickled. Additionally, the need to identify any relevant code related to DPI setting or manipulation would be crucial to understand and rectify the issue. I then reviewed the provided file context and the new search results focusing on files such as `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` and `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` where I looked specifically at their `Figure` class definitions and their handling of DPI, specifically the `__setstate__` method in `Figure` which unpickles the figure state. I also examined the `FigureCanvasMac` class in `backend_macosx.py` which handles canvas creation and resizing, which should include the functionality responsible for scaling based on DPI, and thus indirectly related to the reported issue. The provided search results did not indicate any new or additional files that include relevant code related to the reported issue, so it appears we don't need to search further.",
