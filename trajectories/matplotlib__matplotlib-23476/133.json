            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the doubling of the DPI of a figure after unpickling on an M1 Mac, leading to an `OverflowError` due to the DPI growing exponentially. The main focus is on the `__setstate__` method in the `Figure` class within `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, which is responsible for restoring the state of the figure during unpickling. The provided context and search results do not directly address the specific problem of the DPI doubling. However, we can use the context to explore more deeply into how the DPI is handled during the unpickling process.\n\nFrom the `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` context, we see that the `Figure` class has an `__init__` method where the DPI is set and a `__setstate__` method that restores the state. The `__setstate__` method does not directly modify the DPI, but it sets up the figure canvas and potentially triggers a redraw, which could be where the issue arises. The provided search results include the `FigureCanvasBase` class from `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py`, which has a `print_figure` method that involves settings for DPI and could potentially be used during the unpickling process. Additionally, the `FigureCanvasMac` class from `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` could also be relevant since it focuses on Mac-specific behavior and could indicate any Mac-specific modifications to the DPI handling.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue, the most relevant sections revolve around the `__setstate__` method in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` and the initial DPI settings in the `__init__` method. The `print_figure` method in `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py` and the `resize` method in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py` might be related to how the figure is rendered and displayed on a Mac. These methods hint at the possibility of system-specific nuances that might not be captured by default settings or could inadvertently lead to the exponential increase in DPI if handled incorrectly in the unpickling process after setting up the figure canvas or rendering on a Mac.",
