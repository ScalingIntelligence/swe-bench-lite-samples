The key elements to focus on from the issue are the methods `pickle.dump` and `pickle.load`, which are critical for serializing and deserializing the figure, and potentially the `__setstate__` method which is involved in the unpickling process. The provided search results include `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, which contains the `Figure` class with methods `__init__` and `__setstate__`. The `__init__` method initializes various properties of the figure including `dpi`, which is set based on the parameters or defaults. The `__setstate__` method is responsible for restoring the state of the figure after it has been unpickled. Given the issue description, examining these methods within the context of unpickling could help identify the root cause of the DPI doubling. Therefore, the focus should be on the `Figure.__setstate__` method in the search results as it directly pertains to the unpickling process of the figure, which is central to the issue.",

The initial analysis indicates that the problem might be related to the `__setstate__` method in the `Figure` class, which is responsible for restoring the state of the figure after unpickling. The doubling of DPI might occur due to the way the DPI value is handled or reconstructed during this process. The search results include the relevant code spans in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, particularly focused on the `Figure` class and its methods `__init__`, `__setstate__`, and `__getstate__`. These methods are crucial for the initialization, state restoration, and state capture of the figure, respectively. Additionally, other related spans such as the `FigureCanvasBase` class in `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py` are also identified as potentially relevant, as they handle canvas-related operations that could involve the DPI of the figure. The search results suggest that the identified spans are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue, aligning well with the core functionalities impacted by the reported problem.",

The new search results provide additional context in `FigureCanvasMac` from `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py`, which handles the Mac OS backend.
