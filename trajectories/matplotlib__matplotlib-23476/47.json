These methods handle the initialization and restoration of figures, including setting the DPI.\n\nIn the new search results, the FigureCanvasMac class and its __init__ and resize methods are found.

While not directly showing a DPI issue, it sets a canvas-related context that might interact indirectly with DPI settings.\n- 'FigureCanvasMac.resize': This method could affect DPI as it handles resizing where DPI calculations might be implicated depending on how 'device_pixel_ratio' interacts with 'figure.dpi'.\n\nThus, the identified spans in 'figure.py' and 'backend_macosx.py' may contain relevant code to diagnose or modify in order to correct the DPI doubling issue associated with figure unpickling on M1 Macs.",
