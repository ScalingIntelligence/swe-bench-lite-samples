The code provided for reproduction involves pickling and unpickling a figure in a loop, which highlights the problem. The relevant part of the issue seems to be in the 'Figure.__setstate__' method in the 'matplotlib/figure.py' file, where the figure is being restored from a pickled state. The expected behavior is that the DPI should remain constant, but it's doubling each time the figure is unpickled. In the search results, there are two potentially relevant files: 'backend_macosx.py' and 'backend_bases.py'. The 'FigureCanvasMac' class in 'backend_macosx.py' could be relevant as it deals with the Mac-specific backend and includes a 'resize' method that interacts with the figure's DPI. The 'FigureCanvasBase' class in 'backend_bases.py' is a base class for all canvas implementations and could also be relevant, especially its '__init__' method where the figure is set up. To address the issue, it's important to understand how the DPI value is being handled during the unpickling process and ensure that it doesn't get modified unintentionally. Further investigation might be needed to fully understand the interaction between these classes and the DPI setting.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the doubling of DPI (dots per inch) in a figure after unpickling on an M1 Mac, which eventually leads to an `OverflowError`. The issue seems to be related to the `Figure` class and its interaction with the `FigureCanvasMac` class, particularly during the unpickling process and resizing events. I will analyze the search results to determine if the identified code spans are relevant to the issue at hand.Relevance of code spans:\n\n- Analyzing the code associated with the `FigureCanvasMac` class initialization (span 'FigureCanvasMac.__init__' in lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py): This span contains setup code relevant to initializing a figure canvas, which is crucial for understanding how the figure interacts with its canvas. However, it does not directly address the issue of DPI doubling after unpickling.\n\n- The `FigureCanvasMac.resize` method (span 'FigureCanvasMac.resize' in lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py): This method handles resizing events, which could be related to the issue if the resizing process involves incorrect scaling or handling of DPI values. The section calculates the scaling factor using the figure's DPI and then adjusts the figure's size in inches. This section is relevant as it involves directly the manipulation of DPI during the resizing process of a figure.\n\n- 'FigureCanvasBase.resize_event' (in lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py): This method is deprecated but is involved in handling resize events, which are crucial in the context of the DPI issue. Though deprecated, this method can still be relevant to understand past or current resize event handling during which the DPI doubling issue might occur.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most relevant spans appear to be 'FigureCanvasMac.resize', which directly handles resizing and involves manipulation of the figure's DPI during this process, and potentially 'FigureCanvasBase.resize_event' even though it is deprecated, it helps understand how resize events were handled which is part of the context of the reported issue.",
