The traceback provides a clue that the problem might be in the '__setstate__' method of the 'Figure' class in matplotlib. Figure.py. This method is responsible for restoring the state of the figure after unpickling. By examining the related code spans in the search results, we can identify potential areas where the DPI might be incorrectly handled during the state restoration process. The '__setstate__' method shown in the search results reinitializes the figure canvas and restores the state without explicitly checking or resetting the DPI value. This could potentially lead to the DPI being incorrectly applied or doubled. The provided code spans include the '__setstate__' method, which is the key method involved in the state restoration post-unpickling. Given this, the identified code spans seem relevant to investigating and potentially fixing the issue reported.",

The relevant code spans should focus on the methods related to DPI handling, pickling, and unpickling. Given the context provided in the `file_context` and new `search_results`, relevant spans include those where DPI is set, accessed, or modified, as well as the `__setstate__` method which handles the unpickling process. These sections are crucial to understand and potentially modify to resolve the issue.\n\nThe `Figure.__init__` and `Figure.__setstate__` methods are already identified as relevant, particularly where the DPI attribute is processed or set up. Additionally, the `Figure._set_dpi` and `Figure.set_dpi` methods, along with the property definition for `dpi`, are key for understanding how DPI values are interacted with. These segments need thorough examination, especially how they interact when figures are reconstructed from pickled states on M1 Macs.\n\nFurther, though not directly listed in the context, the actual pickling process and backend interactions during figure creation and display might also need investigation, especially if they influence the DPI settings post-unpickling. The codebase might need a deeper inspection outside the provided spans to fully resolve this issue.",
