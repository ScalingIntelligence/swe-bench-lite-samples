The current EnumSerializer in the Django migration framework only handles single Enum values and fails when dealing with combined flags, resulting in an inappropriate default value of `re.RegexFlag[None]`. To address this, the issue suggests using `enum._decompose` to handle combinations of Enum flags for serialization.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant portions of the Django codebase. In `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`, the `EnumSerializer` class is defined, which currently serializes Enum values by their `.name`. This is the primary area of focus because it is directly related to the serialization of Enum values, which the issue aims to improve.\n\nIn `django/db/models/enums.py`, there are definitions related to Django model choices using Enum, but these are not directly involved in the serialization process addressed by the issue.\n\nIn `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, there are various field definitions for Django models, including the `Field` class and subclasses such as `FilePathField`. While these are integral to Django's model system, they do not directly relate to the serialization of Enum flags in migrations.\n\nGiven the initial context of the issue and the areas where the codebase intersects with Enum handling and serialization, the most relevant file is `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`, specifically the `EnumSerializer` class and its `serialize` method. This is where the current limitation is observed and where the solution should be integrated to support the serialization of combined Enum flags.",

Specifically, it mentions that when working with a field like `regex_flags = models.IntegerField(default=re.UNICODE | re.IGNORECASE)`, it gets turned into a migration with `default=re.RegexFlag[None]`. This is because the current `EnumSerializer` tries to work with the `.name` of the item, but if the value is a combination of flags, there is no single name. The solution suggested is to use `enum._decompose` to obtain a list of names and create an expression to create the enum value by 'ORing' the items together.\n\nStarting from the current file context, there is already `EnumSerializer` defined in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`. This class has a `serialize` method that needs to be modified to support the serialization of combined Enum flags.\n\nIn the new search results, there are relevant code spans in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` under `EnumSerializer.serialize` method, which is already identified as part of the current context. There are also related Enum handling in `django/db/models/enums.py` under `ChoicesMeta` class and its `__new__` and `names` methods. These are relevant because they deal with Enum creation and properties, which might be useful for implementing the decomposition and combination of Enum flags.\n\nOverall, the identified spans in both `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` and `django/db/models/enums.py` are relevant to the reported issue and should help in implementing the required changes to support the serialization of combined Enum flags.",

The EnumSerializer class currently serializes enum values by using their 'name' attribute, which is problematic for combination of Enum flags. The suggestion to integrate 'enum._decompose' to handle this is relevant but not yet implemented in the provided code. There are other helper functions and classes in the context (like ChoicesMeta and other serializers) that might be indirectly involved in this issue by handling different aspects of Django's model and field serialization, but direct modifications to these would require further investigation beyond the scope of the reported issue. Nevertheless, the direct relevance of EnumSerializer allows for a basis to start addressing the issue.",
