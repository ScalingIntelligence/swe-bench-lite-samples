The specific problem is that when dealing with combined flags, the current EnumSerializer fails to correctly serialize the value because it relies on the .name attribute, which doesn't exist for combined flags. This leads to a default value of re.RegexFlag[None] in migrations, which is incorrect. To address this, the suggested solution involves using enum._decompose to get a list of names and then creating an expression to OR the items together. \n\nThe search results reveal the presence of an `EnumSerializer` class within the `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file, which is relevant to the issue. The `EnumSerializer` class currently has a `serialize` method that attempts to serialize Enum values by referencing the .name attribute. This directly aligns with the issue described, as it indicates the code's current approach to Enum serialization and where an improvement is needed to support combined Enum flags. \n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those that define the `EnumSerializer` class and its `serialize` method, as these are responsible for the current serialization logic that needs adjustment to support combined Enum flags.",
