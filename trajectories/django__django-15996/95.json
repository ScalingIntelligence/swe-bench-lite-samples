The problem lies in the EnumSerializer class, which currently works based on the .name attribute of the Enum item. When an integer value corresponds to a combination of Enum flags rather than a single Enum item, there is no corresponding name, leading to the issue. The solution proposed involves using enum._decompose to obtain a list of names and constructing the Enum value by 'ORing' these items together. Thus, the focus should be on the EnumSerializer class within the django/db/migrations/serializer.py file and possibly other related parts handling Enum serialization or decomposing Enum values.",
