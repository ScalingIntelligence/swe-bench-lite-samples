The search results reveal key parts of the UniqueConstraint class in 'django/db/models/constraints.py' which is responsible for defining unique constraints in Django models. Notably, the `__init__` method of UniqueConstraint currently raises a ValueError if no fields are provided, and it validates the condition and deferrable attributes. However, it does not explicitly check if the fields exist in the model. This gap can be addressed by adding a check in the `UniqueConstraint` class or in the model validation process in 'django/db/models/base.py'. Additionally, the 'check_all_models' function in 'django/core/checks/model_checks.py' is responsible for checking all models, which should be extended to include checks for UniqueConstraints.\n\nOf particular interest in 'django/db/models/constraints.py' are the `__init__` method of UniqueConstraint, which is responsible for initializing the constraint with fields, and various other methods like `_get_condition_sql`, `constraint_sql`, `create_sql`, and `remove_sql` which handle different aspects of the constraint.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/base.py', the `Model` class and its `_check_unique_together` method are relevant, as they handle model-level checks, including existing checks for unique_together constraints. This methodology can potentially be extended to include checks for UniqueConstraints.\n\nFinally, the 'check_all_models' function in 'django/core/checks/model_checks.py' manages the overall model checks and should be updated to include validation for fields in UniqueConstraints. This function iterates through all models and their constraints, making it a suitable location to add such checks.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans are from the 'UniqueConstraint' class in 'django/db/models/constraints.py' and the 'Model' class in 'django/db/models/base.py'.

Django's current functionality does not check for the existence of fields within a UniqueConstraint, unlike the older unique_together syntax which raises an error (models.E012) if the fields do not exist. The task involves identifying the relevant code spans that deal with UniqueConstraints and checking for the existence of fields. In the provided search results, there are several relevant code spans: 1. In django/db/models/base.py, the 'Model._check_constraints' method checks for unsupported constraints like CheckConstraints, UniqueConstraints with conditions, and deferrable unique constraints. This is relevant because it indicates where Django currently handles constraint checks, albeit for different aspects. 2. In django/core/checks/model_checks.py, the 'check_all_models' function iterates over all models and their constraints, appending errors if there are issues like non-unique constraint names or overridden check methods. This is useful for understanding how Django goes about checking models and constraints across the application. 3. Throughout these files, there are mentions of UniqueConstraint and the methods associated with it (like __init__, _get_condition_sql, constraint_sql, create_sql, and remove_sql), which are crucial for understanding how UniqueConstraints are initialized and managed. Given the context and the search results, I will identify the specific spans in the provided files that are most relevant to the issue of checking the existence of fields in UniqueConstraints.",
