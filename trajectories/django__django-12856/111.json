This contrasts with the previous `unique_together` syntax, which would raise an error if the fields did not exist. To address this, we need to identify where the checks for field existence are performed for `UniqueConstraint` in Django's models and constraints code. Given the file context, focusing on `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/db/models/constraints.py`, and potentially `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` would be a good starting point to investigate the necessary checks and constraints.",

The search results include several relevant sections from Django's model and constraint handling code, particularly in `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/constraints.py`. The key areas to focus on are the `UniqueConstraint` class and its methods in `constraints.py`, and the `Model` class methods related to unique checks and constraints in `base.py`. These sections already handle various aspects of unique constraints and their checks, but lack explicit validation for the existence of the fields specified in `UniqueConstraint`. Integrating such a check into the current methods, especially in the `Model._check_constraints` or a new method in `Model`, would align with the requirement. Further, the `Model._check_unique_together` method demonstrates how such checks could be structured, providing a reference for implementing a similar validation for `UniqueConstraint`.",
