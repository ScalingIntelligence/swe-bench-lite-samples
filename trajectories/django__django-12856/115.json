The focus should be on the Django ORM's handling of UniqueConstraints and the models' checks to ensure that the fields mentioned in UniqueConstraints actually exist. The relevant files and methods to look into are those related to model checking, particularly in `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, and `django/db/models/constraints.py`. Additionally, `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` is a crucial file for registering model checks.

The initial search results provide several relevant code spans, particularly in the 'constraints.py' and 'base.py' files. The 'UniqueConstraint' class in 'constraints.py' defines the initialization and validation of unique constraint parameters, which is a crucial starting point. Additionally, the 'Model.check' method in 'base.py' is responsible for various model checks, including field-related and constraint checks. This method should be examined to ensure it includes validation for fields within UniqueConstraints. The 'Field.check' methods in various fields also provide a basis for field-specific checks, which could be relevant if extending checks to individual fields. However, the primary focus should be on enhancing the UniqueConstraint class and Model.check to ensure missing fields in UniqueConstraints are detected.",
