This is to address the discrepancy with the older unique_together syntax, which raises an error if the fields don't exist. The relevant code spans should include the initialization and definition of UniqueConstraint class to identify where the fields are specified and where validation or checking might be added. Additionally, the checks should be integrated into the migration process. From the search results, the `django/db/models/constraints.py` file contains the `UniqueConstraint` class definition and its methods, which manage the fields, conditions, and deferrability of the constraint. This is the primary area where the check for field existence could be implemented. The `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` file contains a function (`check_all_models`) that iterates over models and their constraints, indicating a possible place to add a check specifically for UniqueConstraints. Lastly, `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` has methods related to adding and removing constraints during the migration process, suggesting it's involved in the migration life cycle and could be relevant for ensuring checks are enforced at the right stage of the process. All these sections appear relevant as they either directly involve the definition and handling of UniqueConstraints or participate in the process where such constraints are managed and applied.",

Specifically, it mentions that when a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations doesn't check if the fields named therein actually exist, unlike the older unique_together syntax which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist.\n\nFrom the file context provided, we have three files:\n1. django/db/models/constraints.py: This file contains the definition of the UniqueConstraint class and its methods, including the __init__ method where fields are validated.\n2. django/core/checks/model_checks.py: This file contains functions for checking models, but does not specifically check for the existence of fields in UniqueConstraints.\n3. django/db/migrations/autodetector.py: This file contains the MigrationAutodetector class which is responsible for detecting changes in the models and generating migrations.\n\nThe search results provide additional insight:\n1. django/db/migrations/operations/models.py: This file contains various operations that can be performed on models during migrations, including AddConstraint and RemoveConstraint operations.\n2. django/db/migrations/autodetector.py: This file contains the MigrationAutodetector class, which is responsible for detecting changes in models and generating migrations. Specifically, the generate_added_constraints method generates operations for adding constraints.\n\nBased on the issue at hand, the relevant parts of the search results are in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py, specifically the AddConstraint and RemoveConstraint classes. These classes handle the addition and removal of constraints during migrations, which is directly related to the issue of checking for the existence of fields in constraints.\n\nThe identified spans are:\n1. AddConstraint.__init__: Initializes the AddConstraint operation with the model_name and constraint.\n2. AddConstraint.state_forwards: Updates the state of the model to include the new constraint.\n3. AddConstraint.deconstruct: Deconstructs the AddConstraint operation for migration serialization.\n4. RemoveConstraint.__init__: Initializes the RemoveConstraint operation with the model_name and constraint name.\n5. RemoveConstraint.state_forwards: Updates the state of the model to remove the specified constraint.\n6. RemoveConstraint.deconstruct: Deconstructs the RemoveConstraint operation for migration serialization.\n\nThese spans are relevant because they directly deal with the addition and removal of constraints as part of the migration process, which is where the check for field existence within a UniqueConstraint should be implemented to address the reported issue.",

The key steps involve: 1. Identifying the point in the makemigrations process where UniqueConstraint instances are evaluated. 2. Adding a validation step to ensure that all fields specified in a UniqueConstraint actually exist in the model. 3. Modifying the relevant migration operations to include this validation. Given the context provided, the relevant files are 'django/db/models/constraints.py', 'django/core/checks/model_checks.py', 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py', and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. We need to concentrate on methods such as 'UniqueConstraint.constraint_sql', 'check_all_models', 'generate_added_constraints', 'generate_removed_constraints', 'AddConstraint.state_forwards', and 'RemoveConstraint.state_forwards' to ensure that these methods correctly handle and validate the field existence for UniqueConstraints.",

Analyzed the reported issue: The issue is related to adding a check for fields of UniqueConstraints in Django models, specifically to ensure that the fields named in the UniqueConstraint actually exist during the migration process. This contrasts with `unique_together`, which raises an error if the fields don't exist.\n\n2. Reviewed the current file context: The context provided shows existing implementations of `UniqueConstraint`, including its methods for initialization, SQL generation, and state management. These are relevant as they provide the foundation for any additional checks needed for the fields.\n\n3. Processed new search results:\n   - Re-examined the `UniqueConstraint` class and its methods in `django/db/models/constraints.py` to ensure alignment with the reported issue.\n   - Reviewed `check_all_models` in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`, which is responsible for model validation, including checks like uniqueness checks that are relevant to the issue.\n   - Scanned `MigrationAutodetector` and related operations in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` to understand how add and remove constraint operations are handled.\n\n4. Decision on identified spans: Decided that the following spans are relevant to the reported issue as they pertain to the handling of `UniqueConstraint` and the related migration operations.\n",
