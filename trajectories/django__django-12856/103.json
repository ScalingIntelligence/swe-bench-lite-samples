To address this, we need to look for the relevant parts in the Django codebase that deal with UniqueConstraints and possibly _check_unique_together methods. In the provided search results, we find several potentially relevant code spans:\n1. In django/db/models/base.py, there's an _check_unique_together method that checks the unique_together settings but does not seem to directly address the issue of field existence within UniqueConstraints.\n2. In django/db/models/constraints.py, the UniqueConstraint class and its __init__ method define the behavior of UniqueConstraints, including the fields it references. This is directly related to the issue as it deals with the fields included in a UniqueConstraint.\n3. In django/db/migrations/operations/models.py, the AddConstraint class and its methods involve adding constraints, including UniqueConstraints, to models. This is relevant because it's part of the process during which the issue might occur.\n\nGiven these findings, we need to focus on the UniqueConstraint class in constraints.py and possibly enhance the checks within _check_unique_together in base.py to include checks for field existence specifically for UniqueConstraints. The AddConstraint class in models.py may also be relevant for understanding the migration process in which constraints are added.",

This is similar to the existing checks for the unique_together syntax. The existing codebase already has checks and methods related to unique_together, which should be used as a reference. Examining the search results, several relevant code spans are found in `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/constraints.py`. These spans involve checking unique_together, handling UniqueConstraints, and managing constraints in models. For example, `Model._check_unique_together` in `django/db/models/base.py` checks for the proper setup of unique_together and might need an analogous check added for UniqueConstraints. Also, `UniqueConstraint.__init__` in `django/db/models/constraints.py` should be reviewed to ensure proper field checks during UniqueConstraint initialization. Additional methods like `AddConstraint` in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` are related to adding constraints during migrations, providing a broader context for how UniqueConstraints are implemented and managed in Django. Overall, these relevant code spans provide a foundation to identify where the new field check for UniqueConstraints should be implemented in the codebase.",

Specifically, the 'Model' class and its subclass methods such as '_check_unique_together' and 'check' are relevant for ensuring model uniqueness constraints are validated. Given this information, the next logical step is to investigate whether the '_check_constraints' method in 'django/db/models/base.py' specifically handles the validation of fields in UniqueConstraint during model checks. Additionally, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' should be examined for the 'AddConstraint' class which is responsible for adding constraints during migrations, potentially including a check for field existence. Expanding the search to include these specific methods and class will help identify where and how the field check for UniqueConstraints is implemented or needs to be added.",

The current context shows relevant parts of the Django codebase related to models and constraints, including the base model class, UniqueConstraint class, and migration operations for adding constraints. The new search results further confirm the presence of code spans related to model operations, constraint handling, and migration operations. Specifically, the '_check_constraints' method in the Model class and the 'AddConstraint' class in the migration operations library seem most relevant to addressing the issue of checking for the existence of fields when adding constraints.
