In the provided search results, two main files are relevant: 'django/db/models/constraints.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'. \n\nIn 'constraints.py', the 'UniqueConstraint' class and its '__init__' method are critical. This class is responsible for defining unique constraints on models, but currently lacks a check for field existence. The existing implementation raises ValueError if certain conditions are not met, such as no fields being provided, but does not check if the fields actually exist in the model. \n\nIn 'base.py', the 'Model' class and its methods '_check_unique_together' are relevant. This method currently checks the structure of 'unique_together' but does not verify the existence of the fields named in UniqueConstraints. However, this method serves as a good reference for how to implement field existence checks, as it already raises specific errors when the 'unique_together' format is incorrect. \n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans are those defining the UniqueConstraint initialization and the method for checking 'unique_together'.

From the context, we see code related to UniqueConstraint initialization and model initialization and checks for unique_together. The search results duplicate some of these, indicating the importance of understanding if the current implementation covers the issue or if new checks are necessary. Reviewing these code spans, particularly the UniqueConstraint.__init__ and Model._check_unique_together methods, it's evident that the existing checks in UniqueConstraint validation focus more on the types and combinations of parameters rather than the existence of fields within the model. Specifically, we don't detect an immediate check within UniqueConstraint for ensuring the field names exist in the model class definition, which is crucial for this issue. This suggests adding a new validation step in the UniqueConstraint class or enhancing model validation to include checking fields in constraints.",

The current file context shows the implementation of UniqueConstraint in django/db/models/constraints.py and parts of the Model class in django/db/models/base.py. The UniqueConstraint class itself does not currently check if the fields exist within the model, which is the gap that needs to be filled. The model's _check_unique_together method provides a good example of how field existence checks are performed for unique_together. This method should be adapted or extended to apply similar checks for UniqueConstraint instances as well.",
