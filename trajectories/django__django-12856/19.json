Specifically, makemigrations does not check if the fields specified in UniqueConstraints exist, unlike with the older unique_together syntax which raises an error. The focus should be on identifying the relevant parts of the Django codebase responsible for handling UniqueConstraints and model checks. Given the provided context, we should target the files and functions associated with model checks and UniqueConstraints, potentially focusing on the `Model` class methods and the `UniqueConstraint` class in `django/db/models/constraints.py`. Additionally, the `check_all_models` function in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` might play a role in this issue, as well as any migration operations related to UniqueConstraints.",
