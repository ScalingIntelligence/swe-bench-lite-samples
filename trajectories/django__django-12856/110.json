Specifically, the problem is that makemigrations does not check the existence of fields named in a UniqueConstraint, unlike the unique_together syntax which raises an error if the fields do not exist. To address this, we need to investigate the relevant parts of Django's codebase that handle model checks and constraints, particularly focusing on UniqueConstraint handling and any related checks. The primary focus should be on models.base, constraints.py, and model_checks.py, as these files contain functions and classes related to model checking and constraints. Specifically, we should look for functions or methods that handle unique constraint checks and ensure they cover field existence checks.",

From the provided context, the UniqueConstraint class in 'django/db/models/constraints.py' already has an initial check that raises a ValueError if no fields are provided, but it does not currently check if the fields actually exist on the model. The search results provided in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' include operations related to models and fields, such as AddConstraint, RemoveConstraint, and AlterTogetherOptionOperation, which handle the addition and removal of constraints and operations affecting model options. These operations are relevant to understanding how constraints are managed in Django migrations but do not directly address the check for field existence within UniqueConstraint. The existing context in 'django/db/models/base.py' contains a model check method (Model.check) that evaluates various aspects of a model, including constraints, but it does not specifically check for the existence of fields within UniqueConstraints. The search results do not provide specific code spans that directly address the reported issue of checking for field existence within UniqueConstraints, as the relevant checks mentioned in the issue are not present in the code spans provided.",

  "initial_message": "Add check for fields of UniqueConstraints.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Marnanel Thurman)\n\t \nWhen a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations doesn't check that the fields named therein actually exist.\nThis is in contrast to the older unique_together syntax, which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist.\nIn the attached demonstration, you'll need to uncomment \"with_unique_together\" in settings.py in order to show that unique_together raises E012.\n"
