To address this, we need to locate the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with UniqueConstraint checks and potentially the unique_together checks for comparison. Key files to focus on include those from the `django/db/models` directory, specifically `base.py`, `fields/related.py`, and `constraints.py`, as they contain classes and methods related to model constraints and fields. Additionally, `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` is relevant as it contains the function `check_all_models`, which likely includes checks for model constraints. Since the issue asks for a comparison with how unique_together handles missing fields, we should also look at how unique_together is treated in `base.py` and related files. The aim is to find where the check for field existence in UniqueConstraint is missing and to ensure a comparison can be made with the unique_together handling.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to ensuring that when a model gains a UniqueConstraint, the fields named therein are checked for existence, similar to the older unique_together syntax which raises an error if the fields don't exist. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals that the current implementation checks for the existence of fields in the context of unique_together but does not explicitly extend this check to UniqueConstraint. The relevant code spans identified include the '_check_unique_together' method which performs field existence checks for the 'unique_together' constraint. However, there is no analogous method for 'UniqueConstraint'. This indicates a clear gap where a new method similar to '_check_unique_together' could be implemented to handle the checking of fields in UniqueConstraint.\n\nThe search results presented contain several key areas of interest. First, the imports section in 'django/db/models/base.py' brings in UniqueConstraint from 'django.db.models.constraints', which is directly related to the issue at hand. Next, the '_check_unique_together' method within the Model class in 'django/db/models/base.py' provides a template for how field checks are currently implemented for the 'unique_together' feature. This method iterates over fields named in the 'unique_together' constraint and checks their existence. This existing logic can serve as a guide for implementing a similar check for 'UniqueConstraint'.\n\nGiven these observations, the task of implementing a check for the existence of fields in UniqueConstraint can be approached by developing a new method '_check_unique_constraint' within the Model class that mirrors the logic used in '_check_unique_together'. This new method should iterate over the fields defined in each UniqueConstraint and ensure they exist in the model. The identified code spans provide a solid foundation for this implementation and indicate that the search results are relevant and sufficient to commence the development of this feature.",
