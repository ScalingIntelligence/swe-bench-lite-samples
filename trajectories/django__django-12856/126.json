This is to mimic the behavior of the older unique_together syntax which raises an error if the fields do not exist. The current implementation of UniqueConstraint in django/db/models/constraints.py does not seem to perform such a check. The relevant code spans are located within the UniqueConstraint class in this file, notably the __init__ method which defines the UniqueConstraint object but does not check for the existence of the fields prior to their use. Additionally, in django/db/models/base.py, the Model.check method is where various checks for the model are performed, including checks for unique_together but it does not extend these checks to UniqueConstraint. No existing code directly addresses the requirement described in the issue, hence a new check needs to be implemented.",

The Model.check method in django/db/models/base.py is responsible for validating models and can be extended or modified to include the desired validation logic for UniqueConstraint. It already checks various aspects of the model, including fields, indexes, unique_together, and constraints. The relevant code spans include the Model.check method and the import statements for UniqueConstraint. These are critical as they set the stage for adding new checks specific to UniqueConstraint fields. The UniqueConstraint class in django/db/models/constraints.py is also examined, particularly the __init__ method that defines the fields for the constraint. It is essential to ensure that the check mechanism in Model.check extends to this class to validate the existence of fields as required.",

This is similar to the behavior of unique_together, which raises an error if the fields don't exist. The issue suggests that this check is missing for UniqueConstraints. The primary focus is to identify where this check should be added and how it can be implemented. The code provided in django/db/models/constraints.py already includes the UniqueConstraint class, which defines the fields and other parameters for a unique constraint but does not currently check if the fields exist. To implement this feature, we need to add a check within the UniqueConstraint class or its methods to verify that all fields provided in the 'fields' parameter exist within the model. Additionally, we should look for the check method in the Model class in django/db/models/base.py to potentially add a check for UniqueConstraints. In the search results, the Model class's 'check' method is present and likely a suitable place to add the necessary checks for UniqueConstraints. Steps needed include: 1. Adding a field existence check when initializing a UniqueConstraint. 2. Modifying the Model.check method to include checks for valid fields in UniqueConstraints.",
