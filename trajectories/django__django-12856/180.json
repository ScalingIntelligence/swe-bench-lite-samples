This is similar to the older unique_together syntax, which raises an error if the fields don't exist. Based on the issue description and the relevant files provided, we should focus on the classes and methods related to model checks, constraints, and migrations. Specifically, we should look into the Model class in django/db/models/base.py for checks related to unique constraints, and also in django/db/models/constraints.py for the UniqueConstraint class and its methods. Additionally, we should inspect methods in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py related to altering model options and adding constraints to ensure they handle missing fields appropriately.",

The search results from django/db/models/base.py provide insights into how UniqueConstraints are managed within the Model class, including how they are checked and validated. The relevant spans involve '_get_unique_checks', '_perform_unique_checks', and 'unique_error_message' methods which handle the logic for checking uniqueness and reporting errors. Additionally, the django/db/models/constraints.py file provides the implementation of the UniqueConstraint class, detailing how constraints are initialized, how their SQL is generated, and how they are compared and deconstructed. Finally, the django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file shows operations related to adding and removing constraints during migrations, which is crucial for understanding the migration process concerning UniqueConstraints.
