Unlike the older unique_together syntax, which raises an error if the fields don't exist, UniqueConstraints do not perform this check. This could lead to issues where the fields specified in UniqueConstraints do not actually exist in the model. The task is to locate the relevant code in Django's ORM that deals with UniqueConstraints and ensure that a check for field existence is added. From the provided context, it appears that the code related to UniqueConstraints is primarily located in the `django/db/models/constraints.py` and `django/db/models/base.py` files. Additional checks might be required in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` and `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. Focusing on these files will help in identifying where the check for field existence needs to be implemented.",
