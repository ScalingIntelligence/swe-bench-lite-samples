The reported issue highlights the need to ensure that fields specified in UniqueConstraints actually exist, similar to the behavior of 'unique_together' which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist.\n\nFirst, we examine the 'django/db/models/base.py' file, which contains the 'Model' class with various methods related to model checks and unique constraints. Specifically, we look at the '_check_unique_together' method, which currently checks the format of 'unique_together' but does not verify the existence of fields. This is a relevant starting point for adding the desired check.\n\nNext, we look at the 'django/db/models/constraints.py' file, which contains the 'UniqueConstraint' class. This class is where UniqueConstraints are defined and managed. The '__init__' method of 'UniqueConstraint' ensures that at least one field is provided but does not check if these fields exist in the model before creating the constraint. This is another key area to focus on for implementing the field existence check.\n\nFinally, the 'django/core/checks/model_checks.py' file includes the 'check_all_models' function, which runs various checks on all models. This function is where checks for issues like duplicated db_table names, index names, and constraint names are performed. Integrating a check for field existence in UniqueConstraints here would ensure it is applied to all models as part of the regular checks process.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are identified to start implementing the new check for field existence in UniqueConstraints.",

From the search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are those that handle the UniqueConstraint functionality and the checks related to it in Django's Model class. Specifically, examining the Model class's _check_constraints method and the UniqueConstraint class's __init__ and _get_condition_sql methods reveal parts of the code that need to be modified or augmented to implement the missing check. The existing _check_constraints method in the Model class contains checks for various constraints but does not specifically check if the fields in a UniqueConstraint exist. The UniqueConstraint's __init__ method initializes the constraint and does not currently validate the fields' existence. Adding a check in the _check_constraints method or a validation step in the UniqueConstraint's __init__ method to verify if the fields exist would address the issue. Additionally, the check_all_models function in model_checks.py could also be a candidate for integrating this new validation, ensuring that all models are checked for the proper implementation of UniqueConstraints.",

Additionally, the span 'check_all_models' in django/core/checks/model_checks.py is relevant as it encompasses checks for all models and their constraints, which can be leveraged to implement the new check for UniqueConstraints.
