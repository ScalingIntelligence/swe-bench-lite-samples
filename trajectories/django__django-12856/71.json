This check should ensure that the fields specified in a UniqueConstraint actually exist in the model, similar to how the older 'unique_together' syntax raises an error if the fields don't exist. The relevant files and methods to investigate are primarily in the 'django/db/models/' directory, with a focus on 'base.py', 'fields/related.py', and 'constraints.py'. Additionally, 'model_checks.py' and 'schema.py' are relevant for the checking mechanism and schema operations. The goal is to identify where the check for field existence in UniqueConstraints should be added and ensure it aligns with the existing checking framework.",

            "scratch_pad": "The problem at hand is ensuring that when a model gains a UniqueConstraint, the fields specified within the constraint are checked for existence, similar to how the older unique_together syntax raises an error if the fields do not exist. Upon reviewing the existing file context and the new search results, it is clear that the current implementation of UniqueConstraint does initialize by checking if there are no fields presented. However, no explicit checks are performed to ensure that the fields exist within the model, particularly during the process of making migrations. Thus, the task is to add such checks to the UniqueConstraint class to extend its functionality to also look up if the fields provided exist before allowing the creation of the constraint. The emphasis should also be made on how the findings integrate with the existing functionalities and do not fundamentally alter the existing design goals.\n\nThe search results provided include the `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` file where there are various model checks being conducted, although none directly for UniqueConstraints field existence. Given the provided context, it demonstrates a clear case for enhancement, albeit with regards to database table usage by multiple models, constraint names, and index names. Seizing upon such enhancement nature within this file appears to be a likely vector for introducing the necessary field existence checks in relation to UniqueConstraints.\n\nConsidering the existing infrastructure for checks, incorporating a similar approach within the existing 'check_all_models' function, or possibly creating a dedicated function for it, is likely to be beneficial for consistency in code style and to maintain a robust system of checks and validation.",
