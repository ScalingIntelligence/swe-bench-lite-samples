The imports section at the top of the file introduces UniqueConstraint from django.db.models.constraints, which is directly related to the issue at hand.\n\n2. The Model class contains several methods that are pertinent to the issue:\n   - _get_unique_checks: This method is responsible for retrieving unique checks, including those from UniqueConstraints.\n   - _perform_unique_checks: This method performs unique checks, verifying if objects violate any UniqueConstraints.\n   - check: This class method runs various checks on the model, including those related to UniqueConstraints.\n   - _check_unique_together: This method specifically checks the integrity of the unique_together setting, but since the issue involves UniqueConstraint, this method, while relevant for context, may not be directly targeted by the fix.\n\n3. The Model.__init__ method is also included, likely for completeness since it initializes model instances and their fields. However, for the issue of checking fields in UniqueConstraint, this method is not as directly relevant as those methods involved in validation and constraint enforcement.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are those involved in the validation and constraint enforcement mechanisms of UniqueConstraints.",

Spans like '_check_constraints' and '_check_fields' are relevant as they involve field and constraint validation.\n3. **Current gaps**: The current implementation in '_check_constraints' does not explicitly check if the fields in UniqueConstraints exist. This is a gap that needs addressing.\n4. **Conclusion**: The spans identified provide a base for implementing the new check for UniqueConstraints fields.
