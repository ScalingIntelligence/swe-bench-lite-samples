This contrasts with the unique_together syntax that raises an error if the fields don't exist. Focusing on the areas where UniqueConstraints are processed and verified, especially in the context of model checks and schema editor, would be crucial. The relevant files and methods identified in the context suggest that the _check_unique_together method and the UniqueConstraint class are critical. However, UniqueConstraint does not seem to have explicit field existence checks like unique_together does. The search should concentrate on where and how to integrate such a check for UniqueConstraint fields.",

From the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `django/db/models/constraints.py` and `django/db/models/base.py` files. In `constraints.py`, the `UniqueConstraint` class is defined with methods that handle the fields, condition, and deferrable attributes. The `__init__` method ensures that at least one field is provided and performs type checks on the condition and deferrable parameters. The `_get_condition_sql`, `constraint_sql`, `create_sql`, and `remove_sql` methods involve processing the fields and condition for SQL operations. In `base.py`, the `Model` class has a `check` method that performs various checks on the model, including field and constraint checks. The `_check_fields` and `_check_constraints` methods are particularly relevant for ensuring that fields and constraints are correctly defined and do not clash. Specifically, the `_check_constraints` method should be reviewed to ensure it checks the fields of UniqueConstraints for existence and possibly extend it to raise an error similar to models.E012 if a field does not exist.

However, it is clear from the code that there is no explicit check for the existence of the fields mentioned in the UniqueConstraint when the constraint is initialized or during the validation checks performed by the Model class. Since the issue specifically asks for an addition to check for the field's existence on the model, the current file context does not include these specific checks, suggesting that a new check or an enhancement of the existing validation logic is needed.

The current implementation of UniqueConstraint in django/db/models/constraints.py does not currently check for the existence of fields, which is the gap the issue is addressing.\n\nRelevant sections of the code have been identified in django/db/models/constraints.py, particularly the UniqueConstraint class and its methods (e.g., __init__, _get_condition_sql, constraint_sql, create_sql, remove_sql). These sections are critical as they define how UniqueConstraint instances are initialized and how their constraints are managed in the database.\n\nThe new search results in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py and django/db/migrations/autodetector.py provide additional context on how constraints like UniqueConstraint are handled during migrations. Specifically, the AddConstraint class in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py is relevant as it manages the addition of constraints to models during migration, while the MigrationAutodetector methods in django/db/migrations/autodetector.py oversee the detection of changes requiring migrations, including added or removed constraints.\n\nGiven these insights, it is clear that the implementation of field existence checks for UniqueConstraint should involve modifications to both django/db/models/constraints.py and possibly the migration operations in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py to ensure consistency during the migration process. The checks should ensure that when a UniqueConstraint is defined, all its specified fields exist in the model's schema.",
