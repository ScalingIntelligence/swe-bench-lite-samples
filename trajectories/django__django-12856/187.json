This check should ensure that the fields named in UniqueConstraint actually exist, similar to how unique_together raises models.E012 when the fields don't exist. The relevant parts of the Django codebase that need to be inspected include the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py`, `UniqueConstraint` in `django/db/models/constraints.py`, and the model checks in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`. Additionally, the schema editor in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` might also be relevant for understanding how unique constraints are handled and altered. The focus should be on ensuring that the fields defined in UniqueConstraint are validated for existence.",

The reported issue highlights the need for an enhancement in the model validation process to ensure that fields specified in UniqueConstraints exist before migration. This involves understanding where UniqueConstraints are processed and where model validation checks occur.\n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant sections of the code are found:\n- In `django/db/models/base.py`, we see the `Model._get_unique_checks`, `Model._perform_unique_checks`, and `Model.unique_error_message` methods, which are crucial for managing unique constraints and generating error messages when uniqueness is violated.\n- In `django/db/models/constraints.py`, the `UniqueConstraint` class and its methods such as `__init__`, `constraint_sql`, `create_sql`, and `remove_sql` are defined, which are central to how unique constraints are handled at the database schema level.\n- In `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`, we find the `check_all_models` function, which is responsible for performing model checks across all models, including verifying unique constraints.\n- In `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._unique_sql` method is found, which is responsible for generating SQL for unique constraints.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they cover the lifecycle of UniqueConstraints from their definition in models to their enforcement during migrations and database operations. However, the specific check for ensuring that the fields in a UniqueConstraint exist before migration is not explicitly present in these spans, indicating a potential gap that needs to be addressed. This suggests that although necessary parts of the system for managing and validating UniqueConstraints are found, the actual check required by the issue is not yet implemented.",

The methods `_get_unique_checks`, `_perform_unique_checks`, and `unique_error_message` in the `Model` class of `django/db/models/base.py` are responsible for handling unique constraints and generating appropriate error messages. However, there doesn't appear to be a direct field existence check within these methods for UniqueConstraints, similar to the check in unique_together which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist. The `UniqueConstraint` class in `django/db/models/constraints.py` defines the `UniqueConstraint` object and contains methods to create and remove unique constraints. Despite this, there's no explicit validation within the `UniqueConstraint` class to ensure the existence of the fields before creating the constraint. The `check_all_models` function in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` is used for model validation but it focuses on model integrity rather than specific field existence checks for UniqueConstraints. Therefore, the current implementation lacks a direct check for the fields of UniqueConstraints to ensure they exist before applying the constraint, which is a gap that needs to be addressed.",
