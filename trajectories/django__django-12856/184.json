This is similar to the behavior of 'unique_together' which raises an error if the fields do not exist. The goal is to identify the relevant code segments responsible for these checks and potentially modify them to include checks for UniqueConstraints as well. The initial focus should be on the Model class in 'django/db/models/base.py' and the UniqueConstraint class in 'django/db/models/constraints.py', as these are likely places where checks can be added or modified. Additionally, exploring the migration operations and schema editor code in 'django/db/migrations/' and 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' might help in understanding how these constraints are handled during migrations. Model checking functions in 'django/core/checks/model_checks.py' should also be inspected to see how they handle field existence for other constraint types.",

The search results provide several key sections from Django's model and constraint handling, as well as migration-related files. Specifically, the UniqueConstraint class in django/db/models/constraints.py is relevant, as it defines the UniqueConstraint itself and how it interacts with fields. Additionally, the _get_unique_checks method in django/db/models/base.py which is responsible for retrieving unique checks might need enhancement to include field existence checks. The MigrationAutodetector class in django/db/migrations/autodetector.py is also relevant as it detects changes for migrations, though it currently seems focused on managing added or removed constraints without explicit checks on field existence. The BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor in django/db/backends/base/schema.py, particularly the methods handling unique constraints (like _unique_sql and alter_unique_together), are also relevant as they manage how these constraints are SQL-represented and altered during migrations. These sections should be reviewed and possibly modified to include checks for field existence as part of the UniqueConstraint handling and migration process.",
