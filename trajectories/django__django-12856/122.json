This is relevant because UniqueConstraint should behave similarly to unique_together in terms of checks. The search results include relevant code spans from Django's models and constraints modules that are used to define and check unique constraints within models. Specifically:\n\n- The 'Model._perform_unique_checks' span from 'django/db/models/base.py' handles unique checks but does not currently check for field existence.\n- The 'Model._check_fields' span checks fields but does not specifically address uniqueness.\n- The 'Model._check_unique_together' span currently handles checking the existence of fields in unique_together constraints, which should serve as a reference.\n- The 'UniqueConstraint' class and its '__init__' method from 'django/db/models/constraints.py' define how unique constraints are created, which is crucial for any additional checks regarding their field existence.\n\nBased on these findings, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.

However, the specific check for field existence within `UniqueConstraint` is not directly implemented in the provided context. While the groundwork for such a check is present, particularly through the `_check_fields` method in `Model`, a direct and explicit method to validate the fields within a `UniqueConstraint` after its instantiation is lacking.

We can extend this by adding checks to ensure that all fields specified in `UniqueConstraint` exist within the model.

The `UniqueConstraint` class already ensures that `fields` are provided and are a tuple, and validates the `condition` attribute to be either `None` or a `Q` instance. However, these validations do not check whether each field exists within the model's field list. To resolve the reported issue, we need to enhance the `UniqueConstraint` class to include a check that verifies the existence of each field against the model's `_meta.fields`. This could be achieved by passing the model to the `UniqueConstraint` and iterating over each field to ensure it exists in the model's fields list before further processing.",

The current context shows portions of the Model class and the UniqueConstraint class from Django's model base and constraints modules, respectively. The search results reveal the __init__ method of the UniqueConstraint class, which validates the fields parameter. However, there is no explicit check to ensure that the fields exist within the model (as done by unique_together). Additionally, the Model class's _check_fields method in the search results could be a potential location to add such a check, as it currently iterates through local fields and many-to-many fields to perform checks. These observations suggest that the most relevant code spans are the UniqueConstraint.__init__ and Model._check_fields methods, as they are closely tied to the functionality of unique constraints and field validation.",

To resolve this, we need to modify the `UniqueConstraint`'s `__init__` method to verify that all specified fields exist within the model's field list before allowing the constraint to be created. Additionally, we should enhance the `_check_fields` method in the `Model` class to also check for the existence of fields in any active `UniqueConstraint` instances associated with the model.",
