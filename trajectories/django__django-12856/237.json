The search results confirm the presence of the UniqueConstraint class and its methods, which are consistent with the context provided. Based on this analysis, the provided code spans in the search results are relevant to the reported issue as they directly involve the UniqueConstraint class and its methods which would need to be modified or extended to include the desired check for field existence.
