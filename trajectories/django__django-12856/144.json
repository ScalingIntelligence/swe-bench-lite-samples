This issue is crucial because it contrasts with the behavior of the older unique_together syntax, which raises an error if the fields don't exist. It is necessary to investigate the models module to identify how UniqueConstraint is implemented and managed. The files and class methods related to UniqueConstraint, Model checking, and database schema operations provide a good starting point to locate the relevant code snippets and understand the behavior.",

The identified code spans include the initialization of UniqueConstraint, methods to handle SQL for unique constraints, and checks for all models. These spans are relevant because they either directly involve the application or enforcement of unique constraints or provide the framework to add such checks. The issue can be addressed by extending the model checks to include validation of fields in UniqueConstraint. The identified spans provide the necessary context to implement this enhancement.",

The code provided in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` does not currently include a check to ensure that fields listed in a UniqueConstraint actually exist in the model's field list. This is indicated by the absence of any checks in the `check_all_models` function that inspect for missing fields in the UniqueConstraints. The suggestion to implement or enhance validation within this function to include a check for the existence of fields in UniqueConstraints is in line with addressing the issue reported. Therefore, based on the analysis, the relevant part of the codebase for this enhancement has been identified in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`, suggesting that the file context does cover the area where additional checks need to be added or existing checks need to be extended. Thus, it is concluded that the relevant file context has been provided to address the issue.",
