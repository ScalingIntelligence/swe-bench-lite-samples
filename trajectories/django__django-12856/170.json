This is unlike the older unique_together syntax which raises an error if the fields don't exist. To address this, we need to identify where the UniqueConstraint is defined and used, and where the check for field existence is supposed to occur. The relevant files and classes are models.Model, UniqueConstraint, and possibly AlterTogetherOptionOperation as it handles model-related operations. We should look into these to ensure that a check exists for field existence in UniqueConstraints, and if not, introduce it.",

The provided search results include several key sections in the Django codebase: 1. 'Model.check' method in 'django/db/models/base.py', which performs various model checks including constraints. 2. 'Model._check_constraints' method in 'django/db/models/base.py', which specifically checks constraints. 3. 'UniqueConstraint' class in 'django/db/models/constraints.py', which defines the UniqueConstraint and handles its initialization and SQL creation. 4. 'AddConstraint' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', which handles adding constraints during migrations. The 'Model._check_constraints' method is particularly relevant as it currently checks for support of constraints based on database features but does not explicitly check if the fields within a UniqueConstraint exist on the model. This is the gap that needs to be addressed to match the functionality of 'unique_together' that raises E012 if the fields do not exist.",

The code provides a thorough definition of UniqueConstraint and its properties, including fields, name, condition, and deferrable. It also includes methods for creating SQL and handling constraints. However, there is no explicit check for the existence of fields within UniqueConstraints in the provided context. The Model class includes a method 'check' that calls '_check_constraints', but this appears to focus on database support for different types of constraints rather than checking the existence of fields within the UniqueConstraint itself. This suggests that a relevant check may be missing. To fully address the issue, a new check function or enhancement to the existing 'check' method should be considered. Thus, while the provided context indicates where a check may be needed, it doesn't explicitly include a check function within UniqueConstraints. Therefore, searching for or implementing such a function would be the next logical step.",

The current file context and search results focus on the `Model` class, specifically its `check` method, and the `UniqueConstraint` class. The `Model.check` method is responsible for validating the model and its constraints, including `UniqueConstraint`. However, it currently does not check if the fields specified in `UniqueConstraint` exist. The search results show the `UniqueConstraint` class with its `__init__` method, but there is no explicit check for field existence within this method. To address the issue, we need to identify where and how we can add a check to ensure that the fields specified in `UniqueConstraint` exist in the model. This could be done within the `Model.check` method or possibly within the `UniqueConstraint` class itself, by adding a method that verifies field existence. Given the current context and search results, we need to determine the most appropriate place to add this check.",
