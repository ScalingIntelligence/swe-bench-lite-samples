The search results primarily contain code related to model operations, checks, and constraints in Django.

The `Model.check` method also orchestrates various checks on the model, which could be extended to include a new check for the existence of fields within UniqueConstraints. Additionally, the `AddConstraint` operation in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` demonstrates how constraints are added to models, which could guide in implementing the new check for UniqueConstraints fields.

The issue is about adding a check for fields of UniqueConstraints in Django, specifically ensuring that when a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations checks if the fields named in the constraint exist. 2. Review <file_context> to see if there are any initial files and spans already identified related to the issue. In the provided context, we see relevant code in `django/db/models/base.py`, especially the `Model` class and its method `_check_unique_together`. 3. Analyze <search_results> to find new relevant spans of code. The new results include additional methods in `Model`, namely `unique_error_message` and `_check_constraints`, as well as methods related to `AddConstraint` in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, which manage database schema changes during migrations. 4. Match the relevant code spans against the key aspects mentioned in the issue, such as presence and handling of UniqueConstraints and field existence checks. Functions like `_check_constraints` and `AddConstraint.__init__` seem particularly pertinent to the issue as they deal directly with adding constraints in models and fields respectively. The absence of explicit field check in current `_check_constraints` implies a possible place to address the issue.",

The current context shows code spans related to model initialization, unique error messages, and constraint checks. The search results continue to focus on the Model class and its constraints handling. The _check_constraints method in the Model class is particularly relevant as it currently handles checking support for various constraint features across different databases but does not explicitly check if the fields in UniqueConstraints exist. The AddConstraint class in the migrations operations is also relevant as it deals with adding constraints, including UniqueConstraints, but doesn't include a validation step for the existence of fields. To address the issue, the _check_constraints method should be expanded to include a check for the existence of fields in UniqueConstraints and possibly within the AddConstraint class a validation step for the fields' existence prior to their addition.",

  "initial_message": "Add check for fields of UniqueConstraints.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Marnanel Thurman)\n\t \nWhen a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations doesn't check that the fields named therein actually exist.\nThis is in contrast to the older unique_together syntax, which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist.\nIn the attached demonstration, you'll need to uncomment \"with_unique_together\" in settings.py in order to show that unique_together raises E012.\n"
