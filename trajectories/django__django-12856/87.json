The search results provided include code spans from two files: `django/db/models/constraints.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`.\n\nIn `django/db/models/constraints.py`, there is a definition of the `UniqueConstraint` class and its `__init__` method. This class is relevant because it pertains to the unique constraints specified in Django models. The `__init__` method sets up the unique constraint but does not currently check if the fields provided actually exist in the model. This is the part of the code that needs to be enhanced to address the reported issue.\n\nIn `django/db/models/base.py`, there is a `Model` class definition, which includes a method `_check_unique_together`. This method checks if the `unique_together` setting is correctly formatted and if the fields specified in `unique_together` exist in the model. This is similar to what needs to be done for `UniqueConstraint`. The logic used in `_check_unique_together` could be adapted to create a similar check for `UniqueConstraint` in the `constraints.py` file.\n\nGiven these observations, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue are those that involve the `UniqueConstraint` class and its `__init__` method, as well as the `_check_unique_together` method in the `Model` class. These spans should be identified for potential enhancements to address the lack of field existence checks in `UniqueConstraint` settings.",

The current implementation in 'django/db/models/constraints.py' checks if fields are provided and validates conditions and deferred states, but does not explicitly check the existence of these fields in the model's field list. The '_check_unique_together' method in the 'Model' class ('django/db/models/base.py') appears to validate the structure of unique_together entries but does not explicitly mention field existence in the primary context. Therefore, an appropriate step would be to extend these checks to ensure that each field specified in a UniqueConstraint is indeed a valid field of the model. This could involve adding a check in the UniqueConstraint class that iterates over the fields and ensures each corresponds to a field in the model's Meta options. Additionally, examining the migration files in 'django/db/migrations/' will help understand how changes in model fields are handled over time, and how the UniqueConstraint should interact with this process.",

The current context includes mentions of UniqueConstraint and its methods, such as __init__, _get_condition_sql, and constraint_sql, but lacks a specific check for field existence in the UniqueConstraint class. The new search results show additional methods in the UniqueConstraint class, notably _get_condition_sql, which could indirectly relate to field verification but do not directly address the field existence check. Additionally, there's relevant code in MigrationAutodetector, particularly in methods like generate_added_constraints and generate_removed_constraints, which handle the addition and removal of constraints, suggesting potential points for integration if a field check is added.
