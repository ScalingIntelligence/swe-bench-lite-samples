This contrasts with the older unique_together syntax which raises an error if the fields do not exist. The search results show relevant pieces of code from 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/constraints.py' that handle the creation and management of UniqueConstraints. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the '_check_constraints' method could be extended to include a check for the existence of the fields specified in a UniqueConstraint. This method currently checks for database feature support for certain types of constraints but does not explicitly check if the fields exist. The 'UniqueConstraint' class in 'django/db/models/constraints.py' is crucial as it defines how unique constraints are initialized and managed. The '__init__' method of 'UniqueConstraint' validates the fields and conditions but does not check if these fields already exist within the model. Both these segments of code are highly relevant to the reported issue as they involve the core functionality related to UniqueConstraints in Django models. Extending these checks to ensure the fields specified in a UniqueConstraint exist within the model could address the issue. Additionally, the 'unique_error_message' method in the 'Model' class could be leveraged to provide a meaningful error message if a field does not exist, aligning with Django's approach of using ValidationError for such cases.",
