The concern is that when a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations does not check if the fields named therein actually exist, unlike the older unique_together syntax which raises a specific error (models.E012) if the fields do not exist. Relevant files and methods include those in django/db/models/base.py that deal with unique checks and model validation, and django/db/models/constraints.py which defines UniqueConstraint. Additionally, checks related to models and fields in django/core/checks/model_checks.py and schema operations in django/db/backends/base/schema.py are likely to be involved. Searching for these specific methods and classes will help identify where the checks for UniqueConstraint fields are performed or need to be added.",

The '__init__' method in this class involves fields and their existence during initialization. The 'create_sql' and 'remove_sql' methods might also be relevant as they involve the actual SQL execution for creating and removing unique constraints.Given the issue, the relevant parts of the code are found in the methods of checking unique_together constraints and the definition and implementation of UniqueConstraints in the Model class and UniqueConstraint class respectively.",
