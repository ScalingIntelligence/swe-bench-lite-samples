The current behavior does not raise an error when fields in UniqueConstraints do not exist, unlike the 'unique_together' syntax which raises models.E012. To address this, we need to focus on the UniqueConstraint implementation in Django's ORM and model checking mechanisms. We should look into the '_check_unique_together' method in django/db/models/base.py as a starting point, as well as the UniqueConstraint class in django/db/models/constraints.py. Additionally, we should examine the checks related to models, specifically how UniqueConstraints are validated in comparison to unique_together. This will require a detailed investigation of model validation and constraint handling.",

The reported issue indicates a desire for Django's makemigrations to check that the fields named in UniqueConstraints actually exist, similar to how unique_together checks for field existence. The analysis of the provided code reveals that the initialization of UniqueConstraint is handled in django/db/models/constraints.py, specifically in the __init__ method of the UniqueConstraint class. This method currently ensures that the fields provided are not empty and that the condition is either None or a Q object. However, it does not check whether the fields exist within the model's field list. Additionally, the code for the Model class in django/db/models/base.py includes a method _check_unique_together that performs similar checks for unique_together settings, suggesting a potential model for implementing a similar check for UniqueConstraint. The file django/core/checks/model_checks.py contains a function check_all_models that registers and checks models, which could be a place to integrate the new check for UniqueConstraints. Based on this analysis, the identified relevant code spans should include the __init__ method of UniqueConstraint for potential modifications, the _check_unique_together method for understanding how field checks are implemented, and possibly the check_all_models function as an integration point for a new check. This approach ensures that all relevant sections of the code are examined to align with the reported issue.",
