This is similar to the `unique_together` check which raises `models.E012` if the fields don't exist. From the search results, there are several relevant code spans that could be useful for addressing this issue:\n\n1. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model` class has methods that deal with field initialization and checks. Specifically, `Model._check_unique_together` method currently checks the structure of `unique_together` but does not check for the existence of fields.\n2. In `django/db/models/constraints.py`, the `UniqueConstraint` class is defined, which is relevant for the issue since the task involves checking fields in `UniqueConstraint`.\n3. In `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`, the `check_all_models` function performs various checks on models and could be extended to include checks for `UniqueConstraint` fields. This function iterates over all models and their constraints, making it a suitable place to add a check if fields in `UniqueConstraint` exist.\n\nThese code spans provide a basis for where to look to add the new functionality to check for the existence of fields in `UniqueConstraint`.",
