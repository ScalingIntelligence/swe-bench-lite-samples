Relevant files and methods have been identified in the context, primarily focusing on the django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/constraints.py files. The relevant methods in the base.py file involve checking unique constraints, fields, and models, while the constraints.py file specifically deals with UniqueConstraint. The search should focus on these files and methods to find the exact location where the check needs to be added or modified.",

Similarly, in 'UniqueConstraint', the '__init__' method and the 'deconstruct' method are essential for defining and reconstructing the constraints, making them prime locations for adding necessary checks to ensure all field names in the constraints are valid.\n\nKey spans to focus on from 'django/db/models/base.py' include 'Model._get_unique_checks' and 'Model._perform_unique_checks', where the logic to handle checks for unique constraints already exists but lacks the specific check for field existence as required by the issue. From 'django/db/models/constraints.py', 'UniqueConstraint.__init__' and 'UniqueConstraint.deconstruct' are relevant as they are responsible for initial setup and serialization of the UniqueConstraint object, which makes them suitable for adding checks to ensure all fields listed in a UniqueConstraint exist within the model.\n\nThese spans are chosen based on their direct relevance to the issue of ensuring that all fields specified in a UniqueConstraint exist within a model, which aligns with the reported issue's requirements.",
