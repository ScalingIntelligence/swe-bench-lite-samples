            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about adding a check for fields of UniqueConstraints in Django models, similar to the behaviour of unique_together which raises an error if the fields don't exist. Analyzing the search results, there are several relevant areas: \n1. The 'imports' span shows the necessary imports, including 'UniqueConstraint' from 'django.db.models.constraints'. This indicates that further down in the code, UniqueConstraint is likely being used or interacted with.\n2. The 'Model' class contains multiple methods and class methods that deal with constraints and uniqueness checks. Specifically:\n   - 'Model._check_unique_together' is a class method that checks if the 'unique_together' attribute is correctly set. This is relevant because it shows how Django currently handles unique_together validations.\n   - 'Model._check_constraints' is a class method that checks various types of constraints, including UniqueConstraint, and issues warnings if certain constraints are not supported by the database. This method is particularly relevant as it shows how Django currently handles checks for constraints in general, implying that a similar check for UniqueConstraint fields could be implemented here.\n\nGiven these findings, the most relevant spans of code are those that deal directly with constraint checks and specifically those that handle the UniqueConstraint class. The 'Model._check_unique_together' method serves as a good example of how field existence checks are currently implemented for 'unique_together', and the 'Model._check_constraints' method shows where a similar check for UniqueConstraint could be added to address the issue. Identifying these spans of code will help in understanding where new functionality to check for the existence of fields in UniqueConstraints should be added.",

Furthermore, examining how `UniqueConstraints` are parsed and utilized during model initialization and migration could provide more insights.

The current context includes relevant code spans from `django/db/models/base.py` related to the `Model` class and its methods dealing with unique constraints. The search results provide additional code spans from `django/db/models/constraints.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`. These additional code spans include the `UniqueConstraint` class and its initialization, methods in the `Model` class related to constraints, and methods in the `MigrationAutodetector` class related to generating added and removed constraints. These code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly involve the handling and detection of unique constraints in Django models and migrations.",

Specifically, the `django/db/models/base.py` file contains the `_check_constraints` method which currently only checks for database support but does not verify the existence of fields within a `UniqueConstraint`. This suggests that an additional check needs to be implemented here or in a new method. The `django/db/models/constraints.py` file includes the `UniqueConstraint` class where the fields and conditions are defined. Finally, the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file handles migration operations which might affect how `UniqueConstraints` are managed and validated. Although more detailed method implementations are not fully provided, the file context suggests clear areas for modification or addition of checks.
