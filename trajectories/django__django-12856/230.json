            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about adding a check for fields in UniqueConstraints to ensure they exist, similar to the older unique_together syntax which raises models.E012 if fields don't exist. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the search results that deal with UniqueConstraints, model validation, and error checking. Looking through the search results, we find important sections in both `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/constraints.py`:\n\n1. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.validate_unique` and `Model._get_unique_checks` methods are crucial as they ensure the uniqueness of fields and constraints. Special attention should be paid to how unique constraints are gathered and validated.\n\n2. Similarly, `django/db/models/constraints.py` contains the `UniqueConstraint` class which is directly related to the issue. Specifically, the `UniqueConstraint.__init__` and `UniqueConstraint.constraint_sql` methods are relevant, as they define how unique constraints are initialized and translated into SQL.\n\nThese sections will help in understanding how UniqueConstraints currently work and where to implement the new check for field existence. By focusing on these areas, we can ensure that any new functionality adheres closely to the existing codebase while solving the reported issue.",
