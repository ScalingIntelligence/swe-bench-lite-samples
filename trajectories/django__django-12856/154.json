The search results include relevant files like 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/constraints.py'. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the `_check_unique_together` class method seems to already check if fields listed in `unique_together` exist. We can extend this logic to also check for fields in `UniqueConstraint`. The `UniqueConstraint` class in 'django/db/models/constraints.py' initializes with fields and has methods to create and remove SQL constraints. The 'django/core/checks/model_checks.py' file also involves checking models, and might need an update to include checks for UniqueConstraint fields. Finally, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' involves adding constraints, which is relevant for the migration process related to UniqueConstraint. Based on these findings, the task seems to involve improving the existing check mechanisms to include UniqueConstraint and potentially updating model checks to ensure fields in UniqueConstraint exist.",

Specifically, the `Model` class contains methods related to unique checks and constraints, such as `_get_unique_checks`, `_perform_unique_checks`, and `_check_unique_together`. The `UniqueConstraint` class in `constraints.py` defines the behavior of unique constraints, including field checks and SQL operations. The migration operation `AddConstraint` in `models.py` is responsible for adding constraints during migrations. Lastly, the `check_all_models` function in `model_checks.py` performs checks on all models, including those with constraints. This suggests that the relevant files and methods for addressing the issue of adding checks for fields in UniqueConstraints are likely covered. Further inspection of the `Model` and `UniqueConstraint` classes should confirm whether the specific checks for field existence in UniqueConstraints are present or are implemented in a comparable manner to the existing checks for unique_together. If it is found that the relevant parts of the code are similar in approach, then the file context provided is likely sufficient for understanding and addressing the issue.
