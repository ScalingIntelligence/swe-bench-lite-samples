            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about adding a check for fields of UniqueConstraints, specifically to ensure that the fields named in UniqueConstraint actually exist when running makemigrations. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing runtime errors. The main focus of the search should be on identifying the code responsible for defining, initializing, and validating UniqueConstraints, as well as the code that performs checks during migration operations.\n\nGiven the search results, the most relevant sections of the code are located in 'django/db/models/constraints.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'. In 'django/db/models/constraints.py', the 'UniqueConstraint' class and its methods are crucial, as they define how UniqueConstraints are initialized and handled. Specifically, the '__init__' method of 'UniqueConstraint' currently checks conditions related to 'condition' and 'deferrable' but does not explicitly check if the fields exist in the model. This is a potential gap that needs addressing. Additionally, the 'Model.check' method and related check methods in 'django/db/models/base.py' should be reviewed to ensure they include specific checks for UniqueConstraints.\n\nWhile the current code spans provided handle various aspects of UniqueConstraints, none directly address the missing check for field existence. Therefore, these spans would need to be integrated with a new check logic to verify that the fields specified in a UniqueConstraint indeed exist in the model. The task now involves implementing such a check within the appropriate initialization or validation methods of UniqueConstraint and ensuring it is integrated into the model validation checks.\n\nAfter analyzing the search results, the most relevant sections are identified in both 'django/db/models/constraints.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'. The next step would be to extend these with logic to check for the existence of fields in models when initializing or validating UniqueConstraints.",

The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` contains methods for checking fields (`_check_fields`) and unique together constraints (`_check_unique_together`). However, there is no equivalent method specifically for `UniqueConstraint` fields existence validation. This suggests that while the system checks for basic integrity in the definition of constraints, it might lack a thorough existence check of fields across all constraint types.
