Here's how the analysis of the search results proceeds:\n\n1. **django/db/models/base.py**: This file contains several relevant spans. The import section (span id='imports') imports CheckConstraint and UniqueConstraint classes, which are directly related to the issue. The Model class (span id='Model') and its method __init__ (span id='Model.__init__') initialize the model attributes, but this span is less directly relevant to the issue at hand. The method _check_unique_together (span id='Model._check_unique_together') specifically checks unique_together constraints, which suggests it might be a good candidate for modifying to incorporate checks for UniqueConstraints.\n\n2. **django/db/migrations/autodetector.py**: This file includes MigrationAutodetector class with a method generate_added_constraints (span id='MigrationAutodetector.generate_added_constraints'). This method generates operations for added constraints, indicating that it should be reviewed to ensure it supports the proposed checks for UniqueConstraints.\n\n3. **django/db/backends/base/schema.py**: The BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class includes methods like alter_unique_together (span id='BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_unique_together') and _unique_sql (span id='BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._unique_sql'), which handle unique constraints at the database schema level. These could be relevant for integrating new checks into the migration process.\n\nGiven these observations, the most promising spans for implementing the requested feature are:\n- 'Model._check_unique_together' from django/db/models/base.py, which is likely where new checks for UniqueConstraints should be integrated.\n- 'MigrationAutodetector.generate_added_constraints' and potentially 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_unique_together' from their respective files, as they deal with unique constraints in the context of database migrations.",

This is a similar approach that could be used for UniqueConstraint if adapted. Additionally, the `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` is responsible for generating added constraints, which would include UniqueConstraint, suggesting that we might need to expand the logic in `generate_added_constraints` to include field existence checks.
