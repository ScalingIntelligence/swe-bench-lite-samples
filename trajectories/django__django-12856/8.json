The search results provided are predominantly focused on the implementation and details of the UniqueConstraint class within Django's model constraints. The UniqueConstraint class contains methods for initializing the constraint, generating SQL for constraints, and checking equality between constraints, among other functionalities. However, a key aspect lacking in the provided code spans is explicit validation of the existence of the fields specified in the UniqueConstraint against the fields actually present in the model. This validation is crucial to address the reported issue. In 'django/db/models/base.py', there is a method '_check_unique_together' which checks the format of unique_together but does not validate the existence of fields. Therefore, based on the current search results and the absence of explicit field existence checks in the UniqueConstraint initialization or validation methods, the relevant code spans to address the issue are either not fully represented or not present in the search results.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to adding a check for the fields of UniqueConstraints in Django's model system. Specifically, the issue notes that when a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations doesn't check that the fields named therein actually exist, which is a contrast to the older unique_together syntax that raises an error if the fields don't exist. Based on this, the relevant code spans should include the parts where UniqueConstraint is defined and where checks for field existence should be implemented or improved. \n\nThe initial file context provided includes part of the definition of UniqueConstraint in django/db/models/constraints.py, specifically the __init__ method, which is where the fields are initially processed. Additional methods like _get_condition_sql, constraint_sql, create_sql, remove_sql, __repr__, __eq__, and deconstruct are also part of UniqueConstraint's functionality, and considering the breadth of operations involving fields, these methods could potentially require additional checks for field existence.\n\nIn the context of django/db/models/base.py, there's a method _check_unique_together which seems to already contain some checks but might need enhancement to fit the requirements of the new issue. Notably, this method checks the format of unique_together but doesn't explicitly check for the existence of each field listed therein, suggesting a possible extension point for addressing the issue.\n\nGiven the new search results, which essentially reaffirm the presence of these relevant sections in the files, one approach to addressing the issue might involve enhancing the _check_unique_together method to iterate through the fields in unique_together and explicitly verify their existence, perhaps mirroring or extending the logic found in _check_local_fields. Additionally, considering the UniqueConstraint's methods (like _get_condition_sql, constraint_sql, etc.), it appears initial checks for field validity in the __init__ method suffice based on current code, but depending on how field validation is spread out across these methods, they might require deeper inspection or additional logic to ensure field checks are thorough and consistent. \n\nIn conclusion, it seems the main task to address the reported issue would be enhancing or possibly introducing new checks for field existence within the _check_unique_together method in the django/db/models/base.py file, ensuring that not only is the format correct but also that the fields themselves exist within the model. This approach aims to align the behavior of UniqueConstraint with that of the older unique_together, thereby preventing possible errors related to non-existent fields in migrations.",
