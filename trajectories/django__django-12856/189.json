The current file context and search results provide several relevant code spans, notably in the Model class within django/db/models/base.py and the UniqueConstraint class within django/db/models/constraints.py. The Model class's _check_constraints method is responsible for checking constraints, including UniqueConstraints, but it does not currently check if the fields in a UniqueConstraint exist. The UniqueConstraint class's __init__ method ensures the fields are provided and validates the condition and deferrable parameters, but does not check field existence. The new search results reveal additional methods in the Model class like _check_unique_together, _check_indexes, and _check_constraints that are crucial for performing various checks on the model's constraints, indexes, and fields. These methods, along with the UniqueConstraint's own validation, should be updated to include a check for the existence of fields specified in UniqueConstraints to resolve the reported issue. The identified spans from the new search results, especially _check_unique_together and _check_constraints, need to be updated to include a check for each field in the UniqueConstraints to ensure they exist in the model. This will align the behavior with the checks performed for unique_together, raising an appropriate error if a field does not exist.",
