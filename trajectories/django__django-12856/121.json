To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase where `UniqueConstraint` is handled and ensure there's a check for the existence of fields. We should focus on the `Model` class methods that handle unique checks, specifically `_check_unique_together`, and the `UniqueConstraint` class. We should also check the schema editor's handling of unique constraints and the model checks for unique constraints.",
