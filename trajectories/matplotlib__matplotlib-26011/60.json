This is due to the 'emit=False' setting in the 'set_xlim' method within the '_base.py' file when working with shared axes. This suppresses the callback triggering, which is problematic for any code that relies on these callbacks to react to changes in axis limits. The solution proposed by the user involves moving the callback call outside of the 'if emit:' statement, which would ensure that the 'xlim_changed' event is always emitted when the limits change, regardless of whether the change originated from a shared axis or not. Given this context, the search should focus on the '_base.py' file, specifically the 'set_xlim' method, and possibly other related methods or classes that interact with this behavior.",
