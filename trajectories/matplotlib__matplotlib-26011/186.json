This behavior is controlled by the 'emit' parameter in the 'set_xlim' method in 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py'. The current setting of 'emit=False' in the 'set_xlim' method for shared axes prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being triggered. A potential solution mentioned in the issue is to move the callback outside the 'if emit:' statement, which might address the issue without introducing recursion. To investigate this further, focus the search on 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' and look specifically for the 'set_xlim' function.",

This prevents the callbacks from being triggered. The user proposes a potential fix by moving the callback call outside the 'if emit' statement to ensure callbacks are triggered even when changes are propagated through shared axes.\n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant spans are found in the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` file.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
