The provided search results contain two files: '_base.py' and 'geo.py'. The '_base.py' file is particularly relevant as it contains the implementation of the `set_xlim` method in the `_AxesBase` class. This method includes logic for handling shared axes and the emission of 'xlim_changed' events. The 'geo.py' file, specifically the `GeoAxes` class, also has a `set_xlim` method, but it raises a TypeError and is not directly related to the issue at hand. The focus should therefore be on the `_AxesBase` class in '_base.py'.\n\nThe relevant code spans are:\n1. The `set_xlim` method within the `_AxesBase` class which includes the logic that sets the x-axis limits and handles the 'xlim_changed' callback. The method's logic regarding `emit=False` when calling `set_xlim` on shared axes is directly related to the issue described.\n\nGiven the context of the issue, the analysis of the 'xlim_changed' callback not being emitted for shared axes is specifically addressed in the `set_xlim` method of the `_AxesBase` class. This part of the codebase is crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of shared axes and the emission of 'xlim_changed' events.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
