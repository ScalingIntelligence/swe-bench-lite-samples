The primary location where this functionality is implemented is within the `set_xlim` method of the `_AxesBase` class in 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py'. It's observed that the call to `other.set_xlim` in the code snippet has `emit=False`, which prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being triggered. This behavior might have been intentional to avoid recursive calls or other potential issues when multiple axes are updated simultaneously. However, the user suggests moving the callback call outside the 'if emit:' statement to ensure that the callbacks are triggered regardless of whether the update is initiated from a shared axis. This implies a modification to the existing logic in the `set_xlim` method to address the issue directly.",

The provided code snippet from _base.py indicates that when changing the x-limits of a shared axis, the `emit` parameter is set to `False`, preventing the 'xlim_changed' callback from being processed. This behavior is a key focus of the issue. The search results include a number of spans from `lib/matplotlib/axis.py` that are related to axis management and shared axes. For instance, the `_get_shared_axes` method in the Axis class could be relevant for understanding how shared axes are managed. Additionally, the `_set_tick_locations` method sets tick locations and might interact with shared axes settings. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on methods that manage shared axes and their properties would be pertinent.\n\nHowever, despite the relevance of some methods, none of the provided spans directly address the issue of disabling the 'xlim_changed' event for shared axes when `emit=False`. Hence, while these results provide insights into axis management, they do not directly resolve the reported problem about callback emission.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
