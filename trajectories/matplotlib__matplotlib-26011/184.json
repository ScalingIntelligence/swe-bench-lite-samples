The problem is specifically related to the 'set_xlim' method in the '_AxesBase' class within '_base.py'. The provided context suggests that the 'emit=False' parameter when setting the x-limits for shared axes is likely the root cause. To resolve this, we need to investigate the exact location and how the 'set_xlim' method handles the 'emit' parameter, particularly when dealing with shared axes. Given the context, focusing on the '_base.py' file and the 'set_xlim' method should provide the necessary insights.",
