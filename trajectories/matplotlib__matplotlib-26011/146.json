Given the detailed methods within `_AxesBase`, particularly `sharex`, `sharey`, and the `set_xlim`, it's clear how axes are linked but not specifically how the callback mechanism works under shared conditions. The code snippet indeed shows `emit=False` in the `set_xlim` method when handling shared axes, which substantiates the initial concern.

The `CallbackRegistry` class is central to this process, managing registered callbacks and handling event propagation. This module's `process` method is particularly relevant as it directly manages the execution of callbacks in response to specific events, such as 'xlim_changed'. Despite its importance, the `process` method does not directly control whether a callback should be emitted when an axis limit is changed due to sharing. This responsibility lies within the methods setting these limits, like `set_xlim` in `_AxesBase`. As the code snippet from `_AxesBase.set_xlim` shows, when adjusting limits due to axis sharing, the `emit` parameter is explicitly set to `False`. This configuration prevents the emission of 'xlim_changed' events during shared axis adjustments, which matches the issue's description. The investigation into how callbacks work in shared axes confirms the specific behavior but does not directly address the issue of callback emission under shared conditions. To fully resolve the issue, modifications would likely involve adjusting the `emit` parameter handling in methods like `set_xlim` to ensure callbacks are correctly emitted even when changes originate from a shared axis.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
