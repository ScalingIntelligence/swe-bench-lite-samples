The primary focus is on the '_base.py' file where the 'set_xlim' method is implemented. The provided search results include multiple files and code spans, but the most relevant ones are from 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py'. The 'set_xlim' method in '_base.py' is directly linked to the issue, as it contains logic for handling the 'emit' parameter which controls whether the 'xlim_changed' event is triggered. Additionally, the 'Axis' class in 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py' is relevant as it initializes the callback registry for axis events, including 'xlim_changed'. The 'XAxis' and 'YAxis' classes also inherit from 'Axis', which is important for understanding how the axis sharing mechanism works. Based on the issue, the relevant code spans are primarily in the 'set_xlim' method and the initialization of the 'callbacks' registry in the 'Axis' class.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
