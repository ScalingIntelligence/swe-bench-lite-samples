The critical part of the issue describes that in the set_xlim method of _AxesBase in _base.py, the callback for shared x-axes is called with emit=False, which prevents the 'xlim_changed' event from being processed. This behavior seems to be intentional but causes the issue at hand by not propagating the change event to the subscribed callbacks. The provided search results include relevant sections of code from _base.py and parts of axis.py, which deal with axis management, including the set_xlim method. These sections are crucial for understanding how the x-axis limits are set and how the callbacks are managed. Specifically, the _AxesBase.set_xlim method is directly related to the issue, as it includes the logic that prevents the callback from being called for shared axes. Also, the Axis class and its subclasses XAxis and YAxis in axis.py provide additional context on how axes and their limits are managed. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans include the set_xlim method in _base.py and potentially any related methods or classes in axis.py that handle callbacks or axis sharing.",

This issue involves the 'set_xlim' method in '_AxesBase' class within 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py'. The issue suggests that the 'emit' parameter is set to 'False' when calling 'set_xlim' for sibling axes, which prevents the 'xlim_changed' callback from being triggered. The proposed solution is to move the callback call outside of the 'if emit:' statement to ensure the callback is always triggered on axis limit changes, regardless of the 'emit' parameter. The provided search results include the relevant parts of 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py', containing the 'set_xlim' method and the related 'Axis', 'XAxis', and 'YAxis' classes. Additionally, 'lib/matplotlib/projections/geo.py' is included, though it seems unrelated to the issue at hand.
