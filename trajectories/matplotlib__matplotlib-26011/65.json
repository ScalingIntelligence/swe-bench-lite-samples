The provided search results include relevant code spans from `matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` and `matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/cbook.py`. In `_base.py`, there is a `set_xlim` method that handles the setting of x-axis limits and includes conditional logic for emitting 'xlim_changed' events. The `emit=False` parameter in the method call for shared axes is directly related to the issue reported. In `cbook.py`, the `CallbackRegistry.process` method is responsible for processing callbacks, which includes the 'xlim_changed' event. Both of these code spans are highly relevant to diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue related to callback emission.",

The user identified the relevant code in '_base.py' where the 'set_xlim' method is defined. Specifically, the issue arises from the 'emit=False' parameter being passed when calling 'set_xlim' on sibling axes. This prevents the 'xlim_changed' event from being triggered, leading to callbacks not being called. I looked for the 'set_xlim' function and related code spans in the provided search results. The relevant spans include '_AxesBase.set_xlim', '_AxesBase.sharex', '_AxesBase.get_shared_x_axes', and '_AxesBase.apply_aspect'. These spans are central to understanding and potentially fixing the issue. Therefore, I mark them as relevant. There are example files that illustrate axis sharing, but they don't directly address the 'xlim_changed' callback issue and are thus not marked as relevant. Based on the analysis, I specify the 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' file with the spans identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
