The 'GeoAxes.set_xlim' method in both 'galleries/examples/misc/custom_projection.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/projections/geo.py' raise a TypeError when attempting to change the axes limits, indicating that they are not directly relevant to the callback issue but rather specify that changing limits is not supported for geographic projections.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
