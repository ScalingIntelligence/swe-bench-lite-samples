This prevents registered callbacks from being triggered when changes are induced by a shared axis. The issue suggests that moving the callback call outside of the 'if emit:' statement might resolve the problem. To address this, we should focus our search on the 'set_xlim' method within the '_AxesBase' class to identify and possibly modify the handling of shared axes and callbacks.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
