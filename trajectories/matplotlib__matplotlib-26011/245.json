The 'set_xlim' method is responsible for setting the x-axis limits and includes a parameter 'emit' that controls whether to trigger the 'xlim_changed' event. The 'sharex' method is used to share the x-axis with another Axes instance. By sharing the x-axis, the limits of the shared axes are set to be the same. However, the current implementation in the 'set_xlim' method does not emit the 'xlim_changed' event when setting limits for shared axes, which is the cause of the issue described. To address this, one potential solution could be to adjust the 'emit' parameter handling within the 'set_xlim' method to ensure that 'xlim_changed' events are emitted even for shared axes.",
