            "scratch_pad": "The issue describes a problem where the 'xlim_changed' event is not emitted for a shared axis when the limits are changed due to another shared axis. This seems to be due to the use of `emit=False` in the `set_xlim` method within the `_base.py` file. The goal is to identify and possibly modify this behavior to ensure the 'xlim_changed' event is correctly emitted for shared axes. Various files and methods related to axis and Axes management are provided in the context for a more targeted search. A focused search on the `set_xlim` method and its interactions within '_base.py' and related classes is likely to provide the necessary insights and potential fixes for this issue.",

Upon analyzing the provided search results, I found relevant code in 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py' within the '_set_lim' method of the 'Axis' class. This method handles the setting of axis limits and includes the logic for emitting the 'xlim_changed' event and propagating the limit changes to shared axes. The key part of the code where 'emit' is used to control whether to process the 'xlim_changed' callback and propagate the changes is specifically relevant to the issue. Additionally, the 'Axis' class initializes the 'callbacks' attribute, which is used to manage callbacks, including those for 'xlim_changed'. This code is directly related to the issue as it deals with the functionality of changing axis limits and handling related callbacks. No additional files are needed for this issue, as the 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py' file sufficiently contains the relevant code for axis limit changes and callbacks.",
