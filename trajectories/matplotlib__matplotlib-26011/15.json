The main concern is identified in the '_base.py' file where the 'set_xlim' method for sibling axes is called with 'emit=False', which prevents the callback from being triggered. To address this, it is suggested to move the callback call outside the 'if emit:' statement to ensure callbacks are triggered on any change in axis limits. Given the context, we should focus our search on the '_base.py' file for the 'set_xlim' method and its handling of the 'emit' parameter.",

The current behavior uses 'emit=False' when calling 'set_xlim' for shared axes, which prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being called. This matches the problem description provided in the issue. Additionally, the '_AxesBase' class definition and its '__init__' method are relevant for understanding the context in which 'set_xlim' is used, especially the setup involving shared axes.
