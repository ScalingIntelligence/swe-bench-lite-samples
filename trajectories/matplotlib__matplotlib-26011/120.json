The current implementation in '_AxesBase.set_xlim' includes calling 'other.set_xlim' with 'emit=False' for sibling axes, which prevents the callback from being triggered. The search results contain relevant code spans that show how axes sharing is implemented (with 'sharex' and 'set_xlim' methods). Notably, 'set_xlim' uses 'emit=False' when setting limits for sibling axes during sharing, which directly relates to the issue. Additionally, the 'Axis' class file is relevant as it contains methods related to axis scaling and limits which could indirectly impact the issue. These findings align with the issue and provide a clear starting point for addressing the 'xlim_changed' callback not being emitted on shared axes.",

This method is crucial as it directly involves the setting of x-axis limits and includes the handling of shared axes and callbacks registration. The provided code snippet indicates that when an x-axis limit is changed on a shared axis, the 'set_xlim' method is called with 'emit=False', which prevents the 'xlim_changed' callback from being triggered. This behavior is consistent with the user's issue report and suggests that the relevant code to address the issue is indeed included in the file context. However, the exact fix proposed by the user (moving the callback call outside the 'if emit:' condition) is not demonstrated in the provided context, although the context does highlight the problematic condition. Since the context includes all necessary components to understand and potentially solve the issue, I conclude that the relevant code is present and necessary to understand and address the reported issue.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
