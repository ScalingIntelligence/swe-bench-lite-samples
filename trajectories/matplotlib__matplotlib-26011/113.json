This is particularly problematic because it prevents callbacks from being triggered, which can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on these events. The issue specifically points to the 'set_xlim' method in '_base.py' where the 'emit' parameter is set to False when calling 'set_xlim' on sibling axes. This design choice suppresses the triggering of the 'xlim_changed' event, which is the core of the problem. \n\nIn the search results, the relevant code spans are found in 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' under the '_AxesBase' class, particularly the 'set_xlim' method. This is where the issue is directly observed, as the 'emit' parameter is used to control whether the 'xlim_changed' event is emitted or not. Additionally, the 'Axis', 'XAxis', and 'YAxis' classes in 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py' are relevant as they provide the foundational structure for axes in Matplotlib, indicating how axes manage their limits and events. Understanding these classes is crucial for grasping how 'xlim_changed' interacts with shared axes. \n\nGiven these findings, it seems appropriate to focus on the 'set_xlim' method in the '_AxesBase' class to resolve the issue. The potential solution suggested by the user involves moving the callback call outside the 'if emit' statement, which could prevent recursion and ensure that the 'xlim_changed' event is consistently emitted regardless of the 'emit' parameter's value. Addressing this in the '_AxesBase' class would likely be the most effective solution to the reported problem.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
