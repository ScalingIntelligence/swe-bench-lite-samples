The key part of the issue points to the `set_xlim` method in `_base.py`, where the `emit=False` parameter is used when calling `set_xlim` on sibling axes. This suppresses the triggering of the `xlim_changed` callbacks on those axes. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the management of shared axes and the emission of `xlim_changed` events. From the provided search results, the most relevant file appears to be `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`, specifically the `_AxesBase` class and its `set_xlim` method. This method directly handles the setting of x-axis limits and the management of shared axes with `emit=False`. Additionally, the `Axis` class and its subclasses (`XAxis`, `YAxis`) in `lib/matplotlib/axis.py` provide context on how axes and their limits are managed, which is relevant for understanding the broader context of the issue. However, the specific instance of `emit=False` and its implications are most directly found in the `_AxesBase.set_xlim` method. Therefore, the focus should be on this method for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior to ensure `xlim_changed` callbacks are correctly emitted when axes are shared.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
