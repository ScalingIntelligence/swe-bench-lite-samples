This issue is clearly related to the handling of shared axes and the `set_xlim` method in `_AxesBase`. From the provided search results, several relevant spans have been identified:\n\n1. '_AxesBase.set_xlim': This method is directly responsible for setting the x-axis limits and handling the 'xlim_changed' event. The implementation includes a parameter 'emit' which, if set to False, prevents the 'xlim_changed' callback from being triggered. This is likely where the core issue lies, especially when dealing with shared axes.\n\n2. '_AxesBase.__init__': The constructor of the `_AxesBase` class initializes shared axis properties like `sharex` and `sharey`, which are relevant to understanding how shared axes are managed in the context of the issue.\n\n3. '_AxesBase.sharex' and '_AxesBase.sharey': These methods are responsible for setting up the sharing of x and y axes between different Axes instances. Understanding how these methods work is crucial for resolving the issue, as they might affect how the 'xlim_changed' event should be handled across shared axes.\n\nThese spans provide a good starting point for resolving the issue reported about the 'xlim_changed' callback not being emitted on shared axes.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
