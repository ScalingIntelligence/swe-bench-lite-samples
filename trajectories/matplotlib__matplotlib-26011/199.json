This method is central to fixing the problem, as the user suggests moving the callback call to outside of the 'if emit:' statement to resolve the issue without introducing recursion. The file context here is relevant and seems to cover the necessary code for addressing the issue.

The main concern is that the set_xlim method for sibling axes is called with emit=False, which prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being triggered.The analysis involves identifying the relevant sections of code that deal with the setting of axis limits and the handling of shared axes. The initial file context includes the _AxesBase class and its methods for setting x and y limits, sharing axes, and the set_xlim method. The search results provide more context on the Axis class, specifically the _set_lim method in the Axis class, which is used by both XAxis and YAxis classes for setting limits. This method includes the logic for emitting change callbacks based on the 'emit' flag. Based on the issue description, the relevant code spans are those dealing with setting axis limits and handling shared axes, particularly where the 'emit' flag is set to False. These spans include the set_xlim method in the _AxesBase class and the _set_lim method in the Axis class, which are crucial for understanding how axis limit changes are propagated and how callbacks are managed. Additionally, the methods for sharing axes (sharex and sharey) are relevant as they dictate how changes in one axis are applied to shared axes. The identified code spans should provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue and potential areas for modification.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
