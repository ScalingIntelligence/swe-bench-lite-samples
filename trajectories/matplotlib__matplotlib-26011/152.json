The key concern is the use of `emit=False` in the `set_xlim` method within the `_AxesBase` class, which prevents the propagation of 'xlim_changed' events among shared axes. The analysis of the provided search results reveals that the issue is pertinent to the `_AxesBase` class in the `axes/_base.py` file, specifically the `set_xlim` method. This method includes a loop that updates the limits of sibling axes without emitting the 'xlim_changed' event, which aligns with the description provided in the issue. Additionally, the `Axis` and `XAxis` classes in the `axis.py` file are relevant for understanding the callback mechanism and the interaction between axes. Although the `GeoAxes` class in `geo.py` also contains a `set_xlim` method, it specifically raises a `TypeError` and thus is not directly relevant to the issue at hand.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
