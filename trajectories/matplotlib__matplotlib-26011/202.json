The analysis of the search results revealed a relevant code span in the 'set_xlim' method of the '_AxesBase' class. This method contains the logic for setting the x-axis limits and includes a parameter 'emit' which is set to False when calling 'set_xlim' for sibling axes. This behavior might be the reason why the 'xlim_changed' callback is not triggered as expected when changes are made to a shared axis. The issue suggests that calling the callback outside the 'if emit:' statement could resolve the problem by ensuring that the callback is triggered regardless of the 'emit' parameter. The identified code span directly addresses the issue by showing the current implementation of 'set_xlim' and the use of 'emit'.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
