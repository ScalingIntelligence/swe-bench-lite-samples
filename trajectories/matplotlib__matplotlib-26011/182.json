The core problem is identified in the _base.py file where the 'set_xlim' method calls 'set_xlim' on sibling axes with 'emit=False'. This prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being triggered. The solution proposed involves moving the callback call outside the 'if emit' statement to ensure callbacks are triggered. To pinpoint the exact location of the problem and potential solutions, the search should initially focus on the '_base.py' file, specifically around the 'set_xlim' method.",
