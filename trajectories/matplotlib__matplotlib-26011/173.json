The code provided in the search results includes the `_AxesBase` class where the `set_xlim` method is defined. This method is critical as it directly relates to setting the x-axis limits and potentially triggering the 'xlim_changed' callback. The method currently sets the x-axis limits and calls `self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)` only if `emit` is True. It also iterates over shared x-axes and calls `set_xlim` on each sibling with `emit=False`. This behavior aligns with the issue description, where the callback is not triggered because `emit` is set to False when propagating the limit change to shared axes. Therefore, the relevant code spans in the search results are those that define the `set_xlim` method and the `_AxesBase` class initialization where shared axes are set up.",
