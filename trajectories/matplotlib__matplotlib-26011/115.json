The search results include the set_xlim function, which directly relates to the issue described by the user. This function is the exact location where the emit parameter is set to False, preventing the callbacks from being triggered.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
