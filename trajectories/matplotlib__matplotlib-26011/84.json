To address this, one potential solution is to modify the set_xlim method to ensure that the callbacks are triggered even when the change is propagated through shared axes.

This method is critical as it directly relates to managing the x-axis limits and their propagation to shared axes. The method's logic matches the concern raised in the issue, where changes in limits of shared axes due to `sharex` do not trigger the `xlim_changed` callbacks. The key part of the method that needs attention is the `emit=False` parameter used when calling `other.set_xlim`, which prevents the propagation of change events through shared axes, leading to the callback being missed. This analysis confirms that the file context accurately captures the element under discussion and serves as a solid basis for addressing the issue.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
