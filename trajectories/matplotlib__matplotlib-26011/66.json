This is due to the 'set_xlim' method in '_base.py' using 'emit=False' when calling 'set_xlim' on sibling axes. This prevents the 'xlim_changed' callback from being processed for those axes. The fix suggested in the issue involves moving the callback call outside the 'if emit:' statement to ensure it's triggered regardless of the 'emit' flag's value. To address this, I should search for the 'set_xlim' method in the '_base.py' file of matplotlib to pinpoint the exact location of this behavior.",

First, the '_AxesBase' class and its '__init__' method are relevant because they handle the initialization of axes and sharing of axes. The 'set_xlim' method is particularly relevant as it directly deals with setting the x-axis limits and managing the 'xlim_changed' event. This method includes logic for calling sibling axes with 'emit=False', which is the core issue mentioned in the report. This part should be investigated further to understand why 'emit=False' is used and whether it could be changed to 'emit=True' to resolve the issue without introducing recursion. The other sections such as 'ArtistList' and general imports are less relevant to the immediate issue but could be useful for a broader understanding of the codebase.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
