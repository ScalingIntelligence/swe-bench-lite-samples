In the '_AxesBase.set_xlim' span, the 'set_xlim' method is defined, and it includes the logic to call 'other.set_xlim' with 'emit=False' for each sibling in '_shared_x_axes'. This is the exact point where the 'xlim_changed' event is suppressed.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
