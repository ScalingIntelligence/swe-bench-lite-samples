The 'set_xlim' method includes the logic for calling 'xlim_changed' callbacks and updating the shared axes with 'emit=False', which is the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the 'Axis', 'XAxis', and 'YAxis' classes in 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py' provide context on how axes are managed and callbacks are registered.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
