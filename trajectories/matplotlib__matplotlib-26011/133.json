The provided code snippet in the search results includes the set_xlim method from the '_AxesBase' class, which is directly related to the issue. The method sets the x-axis limits and includes a parameter 'emit' which controls whether the 'xlim_changed' callback is triggered. The implementation of set_xlim shows that when 'emit' is set to False (as it is when setting limits for sibling axes in a shared context), the callback is not processed. This behavior aligns with the issue description where the callback is not being triggered due to the emit=False setting. The code also includes the initialization of the '_AxesBase' class where shared axes are set up, further confirming the relevance of this code to the issue. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans are directly related to the reported issue and should be considered relevant.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
