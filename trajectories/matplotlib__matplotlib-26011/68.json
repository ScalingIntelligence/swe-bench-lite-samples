The relevant code spans should focus on the implementation of 'set_xlim' and how it handles shared axes and callback emissions. From the search results, we find two relevant files: 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/projections/geo.py'. In 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py', there is a detailed implementation of '_AxesBase.set_xlim', which aligns with the issue description. This method is crucial because it controls how the x-axis limits are set, including the handling of shared axes and the emission of 'xlim_changed' callbacks. By examining 'set_xlim', we can see the current handling of the 'emit' parameter and how callbacks are managed when axes are shared. This is exactly where the issue lies, as described by the user. The other file, 'lib/matplotlib/projections/geo.py', contains 'GeoAxes.set_xlim', but it throws a TypeError. This indicates that this method is not applicable for geographic projections, which is informative but not relevant to the main issue of shared axis callbacks. Therefore, the relevant code span is in 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py', specifically '_AxesBase.set_xlim'. The context provided by the user highlights the necessity to adjust the 'emit' parameter and callback handling in this method. This meets the criteria necessary to resolve the reported issue.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
