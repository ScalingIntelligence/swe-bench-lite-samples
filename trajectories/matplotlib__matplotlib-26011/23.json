The provided code snippet from '_base.py' shows that the set_xlim method for sibling axes is called with emit=False, which prevents the 'xlim_changed' callback from being processed for those sibling axes. This behavior seems to be intentional but is causing issues as described. To address this, we should focus our search on the set_xlim method in the 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' file and also look into the 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py' file to check if there are similar settings affecting the XAxis and YAxis classes.",

The relevant sections of the code are where the 'set_xlim' method is defined and the part where the method calls the 'set_xlim' of sibling axes with 'emit=False'. This behavior prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being triggered. Additionally, the search results include the 'XAxis' and 'YAxis' classes which are relevant as they deal with axis management, although the core issue is not primarily related to these classes.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
