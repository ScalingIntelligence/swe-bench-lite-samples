The provided search results contain the relevant code from the '_AxesBase' class in 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py', particularly the 'set_xlim' method where the issue seems to originate. In the current implementation, the 'set_xlim' method for sibling axes is called with 'emit=False', which prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being triggered. The issue proposes that 'xlim_changed' callbacks should at least be triggered for any change in axis limits, and suggests moving the callback call outside of the 'if emit:' statement. Commenting on why the callbacks might be inside the if-statement isn't straightforward without diving deeper into the entire codebase and the initial design decisions. However, based on the issue description and the provided code, it is reasonable to flag the identified code span as relevant to the reported issue.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
