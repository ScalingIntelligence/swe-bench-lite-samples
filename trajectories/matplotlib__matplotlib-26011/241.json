This prevents the callback from being triggered, which can be problematic for developers relying on these callbacks to react to changes in axis limits. To address this, a focused search on the set_xlim method within the _base.py file of the matplotlib library is necessary to identify the exact location and context of this method. Additionally, examining the _shared_x_axes functionality to understand how axis sharing influences the callback emission could provide deeper insight into potential fixes or improvements.",

The relevant code block is identified in the '_AxesBase.set_xlim' span where the 'set_xlim' method updates the x-axis limits, and for shared axes, it calls 'set_xlim' with 'emit=False'. This explicitly suppresses the 'xlim_changed' event. Thus, the key point in the code related to the issue is the use of 'emit=False' in the call to 'set_xlim' for other axes in the '_shared_x_axes' group. To address the issue as described, a potential change could involve moving or modifying the event emission mechanism within the 'set_xlim' method. This could be implemented by either removing 'emit=False' or restructuring the method to ensure the event is emitted when limits are changed via shared axes.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
