The user's proposal to move the callback call outside of the 'if emit:' statement is aimed at ensuring the 'xlim_changed' event is always triggered.\n\nThe identified code spans include the entire _AxesBase class and the specific method set_xlim, which directly addresses the issue reported.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
