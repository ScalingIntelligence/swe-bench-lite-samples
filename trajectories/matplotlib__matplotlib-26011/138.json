This behavior prevents the 'xlim_changed' callback from being triggered, which could be crucial for reacting to any change in axis limits. The user suggests moving the callback call outside of the 'if emit:' statement, which could solve the issue without introducing a recursion problem. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code sections in 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' related to 'set_xlim' and the handling of shared axes. Based on the search results provided, the relevant code sections are '_AxesBase' and '_AxesBase.set_xlim'. '_AxesBase.set_xlim' is particularly important as it contains the logic for setting the x-axis limits and handling the 'emit' parameter. This code section should be examined in detail to understand how 'emit=False' affects the 'xlim_changed' callback and to potentially apply the user's suggested solution.",
