The primary focus of the issue is within the set_xlim method of the _AxesBase class, where changes in the x-axis limits are propagated to sibling axes with emit=False. This suppresses the triggering of the 'xlim_changed' callbacks, which is the core problem described. In the provided search results, the relevant sections are the imports section and the definition of _AxesBase, particularly the set_xlim method. These sections provide the necessary context and the problematic code where emit=False is used when calling set_xlim on sibling axes. This ensures that not only do the callbacks not get triggered, but also the change does not propagate further through the sibling axes due to the emit=False setting. The additional context in the __init__ method helps in understanding how axes are shared and initialized, which is pertinent to grasp the scope and implications of the issue at hand.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
