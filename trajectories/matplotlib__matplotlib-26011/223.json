The key piece of information from the issue is the specific behavior of the 'set_xlim' method in the '_AxesBase' class where the 'emit' parameter is set to False when calling 'set_xlim' on sibling axes. This prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being triggered. The search results confirm the existence of the 'set_xlim' method in '_AxesBase' with the described behavior. Additionally, there are other related methods and classes such as 'XAxis' and 'YAxis' which are relevant as they extend the 'Axis' class and could potentially interact with the 'set_xlim' method. The 'GeoAxes' class is not relevant to the issue as it does not support changing axes limits in the context of geographic projections. The analysis shows that the 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' file contains the relevant code span that needs to be addressed to resolve the issue.
