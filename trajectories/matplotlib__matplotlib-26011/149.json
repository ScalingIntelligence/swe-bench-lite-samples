However, within the '_AxesBase' class in the 'matplotlib/axes/_base.py' file, there are instances where the 'set_xlim' method is called with 'emit=False' within the 'sharex' and 'sharey' methods. This confirms that the sharing of axes does indeed call 'set_xlim' and 'set_ylim' with 'emit=False', potentially preventing the 'xlim_changed' callback from being triggered. Therefore, these methods should be the focus for addressing the issue of the 'xlim_changed' callback not being triggered for shared axes.",
