The suggested fix involves moving the callback call outside the `if emit:` condition to ensure callbacks are always triggered.

The main focus is on the `set_xlim` method in the `_AxesBase` class within the 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' file. This method is responsible for setting the limits of the x-axis and has a parameter `emit` which, when set to False, prevents the 'xlim_changed' event from being triggered. The issue suggests that this behavior might be unintended and proposes a potential fix by moving the callback call outside the `if emit` condition to ensure the callback is always triggered. The provided search results include the relevant parts of the `_AxesBase` class, specifically the `__init__`, `sharex`, and `set_xlim` methods, which are directly related to axis sharing and limit setting. The `set_xlim` method in the search results matches the description given in the issue, indicating that it sets the x-axis limits and calls other shared axes with `emit=False`. This confirms the relevance of the search results to the reported issue. The search task can be considered complete as the relevant code spans have been identified.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
