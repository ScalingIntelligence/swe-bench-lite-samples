The relevant code spans in the search results include the initialization of the _AxesBase class, specifically the handling of shared axes through the parameters 'sharex' and 'sharey'. Additionally, the method 'set_xlim' is of particular interest as it directly handles the axis limits and the emission of the 'xlim_changed' event. The issue points out that the current implementation calls 'set_xlim' with 'emit=False' for sibling axes, which prevents the propagation of the 'xlim_changed' event across shared axes. This behavior aligns with the observed bug where callbacks are not triggered under these conditions. The proposed solution suggests moving the callback call outside of the 'if emit:' statement to address this issue, indicating that the callback should always be triggered regardless of the 'emit' flag.",
