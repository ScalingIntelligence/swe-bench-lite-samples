Specifically:\n- 'set_xlim' contains the logic for setting the x-axis limits and triggering the 'xlim_changed' event.\n- '_AxesBase.__init__' deals with the initialization of the axes, including shared axes setup.\n- 'sharex' method explicitly deals with sharing x-axis properties across different axes instances.\nHence, these code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",

The main focus is on the `set_xlim` method in the `_AxesBase` class and how changes in axis limits are propagated to sibling axes. The issue suggests that the callbacks should be triggered for any change in axis limits, even those induced by a shared axis. The current implementation of `set_xlim` uses `emit=False` when calling `set_xlim` on sibling axes, preventing the `xlim_changed` event from being emitted. The user proposes moving the callback call outside the `if emit:` condition to resolve the issue.\n\nFrom the provided search results, relevant code spans have been identified:\n1. `_AxesBase.set_xlim`: This method is central to the issue, as it handles the setting of x-axis limits and the propagation of changes to shared axes.\n2. `_AxesBase._set_lim`: This method is called by `set_xlim` and involves the actual setting of limits, which should also be considered.\n3. `_AxesBase._shared_x_axes`: This is used in `set_xlim` to get sibling axes that share the x-axis, indicating where changes might need to be propagated.\n4. `_AxesBase.callbacks.process`: This is where the 'xlim_changed' event would be processed and emitted if `emit=True`.\n\nThese sections of code are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of `xlim_changed` event emission in shared axes scenarios.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
