The relevant code snippet provided in the issue highlights that the `set_xlim` method in `_base.py` calls `set_xlim` with `emit=False` for sibling axes, which prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being triggered. This code snippet suggests that the callback should be triggered, even when the change is induced by a shared axis. The search results include the full implementation of the `set_xlim` method in `_base.py`, which confirms the presence of the `emit=False` logic. Additionally, there are definitions for `XAxis` and `YAxis` classes in `axis.py`, which might be relevant if further modifications are needed to ensure the 'xlim_changed' callback is correctly emitted for shared axes. The other search results, such as unrelated axis classes and the `GeoAxes` class, are not directly relevant to this specific issue.",
