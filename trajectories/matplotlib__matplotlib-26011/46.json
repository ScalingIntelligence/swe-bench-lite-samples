The relevant part of the code is found in the '_AxesBase.set_xlim' span, where the 'set_xlim' method is defined. This method is crucial because it controls the behavior of the x-axis limits and includes the logic for handling shared axes with 'emit=False'. The issue arises because the 'xlim_changed' callback is skipped due to the 'emit=False' parameter when the method is called for the sibling axes. This behavior prevents the callbacks from being triggered, which is the core problem described in the issue.
