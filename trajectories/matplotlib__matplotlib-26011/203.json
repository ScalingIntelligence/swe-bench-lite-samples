The user pointed out that in the '_base.py' file, the 'set_xlim' method for sibling axes is called with 'emit=False', which prevents the 'xlim_changed' event from being processed and stops the propagation of the event to other x-axes. The user also mentions that setting 'emit=True' introduces a recursion issue. The search results include relevant code spans from '_base.py' that contain the 'set_xlim' method within the '_AxesBase' class. These code spans directly relate to the manipulation of axis limits and the management of callbacks, which are central to the reported issue. There are also code spans from 'axis.py' showing the 'XAxis' and 'YAxis' classes, which are relevant as they handle the axis objects and could potentially be involved in the issue. The search results from 'geo.py' and 'custom_projection.py', which include different implementations of 'set_xlim', are less relevant to the reported issue as they do not pertain to the shared axis functionality in question. Given the provided context and search results, the primary focus should be on the '_base.py' file and the '_AxesBase' class's 'set_xlim' implementation, which is directly linked to the issue of 'xlim_changed' not being emitted for shared axes.",

The search results confirm the presence of the set_xlim method in the _AxesBase class, which aligns with the reported issue.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
