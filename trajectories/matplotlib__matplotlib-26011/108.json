            "scratch_pad": "The issue describes a problem where the 'xlim_changed' callbacks are not being emitted when an axis is shared. The problem seems to stem from the 'set_xlim' method in '_base.py' where the `emit=False` parameter is being used when calling the 'set_xlim' method of sibling axes. This prevents the callbacks from being triggered. To investigate further, it's important to look at the 'set_xlim' method in '_base.py', which is the main suspect for this behavior. Additionally, the issue suggests moving the callback call outside the 'if emit:' statement as a potential solution, so it's also worth looking at the context where 'emit=True' might introduce recursion. Given the context provided, it seems that the 'axis.py' file should also be considered as it defines the 'XAxis' and 'YAxis' classes, which might have related methods that could affect the 'xlim_changed' callback behavior.",

The key focus of the issue is the 'set_xlim' method in '_base.py', specifically the line where 'set_xlim' for sibling axes is called with 'emit=False'. This behavior prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being triggered, which is intended to react to any change in axis limits. Based on the search results, the method '_AxesBase.set_xlim' is found in the file 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py'. This method contains the logic related to setting the x-axis limits, including the handling of the 'emit' parameter. This directly aligns with the reported issue, where the 'emit' parameter's value of 'False' is causing the desired callbacks not to be triggered.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
