The provided search results include the '_AxesBase' class definition, which contains the 'set_xlim' method. This method is crucial as it directly relates to setting the x-axis limits, which is central to the issue. The 'set_xlim' method includes the logic for handling shared axes and the 'emit' parameter, which controls whether the 'xlim_changed' callback is triggered. This matches the issue description where 'emit=False' prevents the callback from being called. Therefore, the relevant code span is the 'set_xlim' method within the '_AxesBase' class, which is responsible for handling the x-axis limits and the callbacks.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
