This is particularly relevant in the context of the `set_xlim` method in `_AxesBase` class in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`. The code snippet provided in the issue directly correlates with the `set_xlim` method found in the search results.\n2. In the provided `_AxesBase.set_xlim` method, the callback for 'xlim_changed' is only triggered if `emit` is True. When `emit` is False, which is the case when changing the limits of a shared axis, the callback is not triggered. This matches the issue's description.\n3. The issue suggests that moving the callback call outside the 'if emit:' statement might solve the problem. This implies that the current implementation is restrictive in terms of when callbacks are allowed to be processed, which hinders the intended functionality when axes are shared.\n4. Other parts of the search results, such as the `XAxis` and `YAxis` classes in `axis.py`, though related to axis functionalities, do not directly address the callback emission issue described. Therefore, they are less relevant to the current issue compared to the `set_xlim` method in `_base.py`.\n5. The `GeoAxes.set_xlim` method in `geo.py` is irrelevant as it raises a TypeError, indicating that changing axes limits is not supported in that context.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
