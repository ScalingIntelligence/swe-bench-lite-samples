The user has identified that when `set_xlim` is called for sibling axes, it is called with `emit=False`, which prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being processed for those sibling axes. This behavior is causing the issue because the callbacks are not being triggered as expected when the x-axis limits change on shared axes. The user suggests that moving the callback call outside of the 'if emit:'-statement might solve the issue, but they haven't understood clearly why `emit=False` is used and if doing so causes any other problems. The search results contain the relevant code spans, including the `set_xlim` method and related methods like `set_ylim`, `set_figure`, and `sharex`, which are also crucial for understanding how axes sharing and limit changes are handled in matplotlib. Based on the issue description and the provided code spans, I will identify the relevant code spans.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
