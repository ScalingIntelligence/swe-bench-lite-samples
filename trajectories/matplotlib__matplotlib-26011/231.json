The user identified the relevant part of the code in the `set_xlim` method in '_base.py' where the callback is conditionally emitted based on the 'emit' parameter, which is set to `False` when calling `set_xlim` for sibling axes. The user suggests that this might be causing the callback to not be triggered as expected. The search results include the complete `set_xlim` method from the 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' file, which is directly relevant to the issue. This method contains the logic for setting the x-axis limits and the conditional emission of the 'xlim_changed' event. The presence of the `emit=False` parameter in the call to `other.set_xlim` within the `set_xlim` method supports the user's observation that callbacks might not be triggered as intended when axes are shared. Therefore, the identified code span is crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
