It seems that this parameter is set to 'False' when calling 'set_xlim' for sibling axes, preventing the 'xlim_changed' event from propagating.

The primary concern is with the 'set_xlim' method in the _AxesBase class, where the 'emit' parameter is set to False, preventing the 'xlim_changed' callback from being triggered when the change is induced by a shared axis. The provided search results include the _AxesBase class and its methods. The 'set_xlim' method is especially relevant as it contains the logic that controls whether the 'xlim_changed' event is emitted. This method calls 'self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)' conditionally based on the 'emit' parameter, and subsequently calls 'set_xlim' on sibling axes with 'emit=False', which is the root cause of the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are the class definition of _AxesBase and the set_xlim method.",
