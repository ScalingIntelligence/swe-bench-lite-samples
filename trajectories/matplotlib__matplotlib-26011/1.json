This issue is specifically about the behavior of the 'set_xlim' method in the 'matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' file. The provided search results include the relevant file and several code spans that are pertinent to the issue. The '_AxesBase.set_xlim' span contains the implementation of the 'set_xlim' method, which is where the problem is occurring. This method calls 'other.set_xlim' with 'emit=False' for each shared axis, preventing the 'xlim_changed' callback from being triggered. This aligns with the user's description of the bug and suggests that this span of code is directly related to the issue. Other spans in the file, such as the class definition and constructor, provide context but are not directly relevant to the specific problem of 'xlim_changed' not being emitted.
