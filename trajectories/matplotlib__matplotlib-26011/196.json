The problem seems to be in the '_base.py' file, specifically in the 'set_xlim' method where the 'emit' parameter is set to False when calling 'set_xlim' on shared axes. This prevents the 'xlim_changed' callbacks from being processed for the shared axes. To address this, we should search for the relevant code snippet that controls this behavior and consider alternatives like moving the callback call outside of the 'if emit:' statement. We will also look for any related methods or classes in 'axis.py' and 'axes3d.py' to ensure a comprehensive understanding of how axis limits and shared axes are managed.",

The provided code snippets from 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py' show some methods related to axis limits and callbacks, which might be relevant. In particular, the 'Axis._set_lim' method seems to handle setting limits, including an 'emit' parameter that determines whether to trigger callbacks. This directly relates to the issue of callbacks not being triggered for shared axes. Additionally, the '_get_shared_axes' method is used within '_set_lim', indicating the interaction with shared axes. Consequently, these spans are likely relevant for addressing the issue. For completeness, 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py' was also reviewed, but it primarily deals with 3D axes functionalities, which seem unrelated to the current issue, focusing on 2D shared axes behavior. Therefore, the relevant spans seem concentrated in 'lib/matplotlib/axis.py'.",

The method already has the necessary logic to process callbacks for shared axes, but it sets 'emit=False' when calling '_set_lim' on shared axes. This behavior seems relevant to the issue described, as it indicates that the callbacks are intentionally not being triggered for shared axes, potentially causing the 'xlim_changed' callbacks not to be emitted. However, the exact location where 'emit=False' is being set in the original issue's '_base.py' is not explicitly provided in the file context, leading to some uncertainty about whether all relevant parts of the code are included.
