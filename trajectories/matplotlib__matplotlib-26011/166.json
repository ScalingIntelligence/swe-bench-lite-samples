The relevant code snippet from _base.py indicates that sibling axes' set_xlim method is called with emit=False, which prevents the propagation of 'xlim_changed' events. This behavior may stem from a desire to prevent infinite recursion or unnecessary event propagation. However, the user proposes moving the callback call outside the 'if emit:' statement to resolve the issue. To verify the impact and potential side effects of this change, it's necessary to investigate how 'set_xlim' and 'xlim_changed' events interact across shared axes.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
