The root cause seems to be the 'emit=False' parameter in the 'set_xlim' method within the '_base.py' file. To address this, it's necessary to review the 'set_xlim' method and the logic handling shared axes to determine the best way to ensure 'xlim_changed' callbacks are appropriately triggered. Potential solutions discussed involve modifying the placement of the callback call. To begin, we should focus our search on the '_base.py' file and specifically the 'set_xlim' method.",

The specific section that deals with the 'emit' parameter is crucial, as it determines whether the 'xlim_changed' event is triggered and whether the change is propagated to sibling axes.
