This function is crucial for understanding how axis limits are set and shared among axes, especially how the 'emit' parameter is used to control whether or not the 'xlim_changed' event is triggered. The 'sharex' method is also present and plays a key role in sharing the x-axis among different Axes instances. The '_shared_axes' attribute is used to manage these shared axes, which directly impacts how events are propagated. Given this context, it is possible to address the reported issue requiring changes in these specific functions and attributes. However, the full implementation and details of the 'set_xlim' method and its interaction with shared axes are clearly present in the code base, which will enable modifications to address the issue without external references.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
