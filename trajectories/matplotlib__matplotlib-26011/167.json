The provided search results contain the relevant section of the code from _base.py where the set_xlim method is defined. The method includes logic for handling shared axes, specifically where it calls other shared x-axes with emit=False. This disables the emission of 'xlim_changed' callbacks to the siblings, which is the core issue described in the bug report. Therefore, the identified code spans are directly related to the problem, making the search task complete.

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
