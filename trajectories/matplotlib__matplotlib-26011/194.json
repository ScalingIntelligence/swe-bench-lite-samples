The provided search results include the `set_xlim` method in the `_AxesBase` class, which is relevant as it directly deals with setting the x-axis limits and managing the 'xlim_changed' callback. This method, located in the `_AxesBase` class, includes logic to call `other.set_xlim` on sibling axes with `emit=False`. This behavior is explicitly mentioned in the issue, suggesting that this is the area of the code where the problem lies. The decision to set `emit=False` in this context seems to prevent the 'xlim_changed' callback from being triggered on sibling axes, which is the root cause of the issue described. Given this direct relevance, the provided code spans cover the essential parts of the codebase related to the issue, suggesting that the search can be considered complete regarding the direct functionality concern related to 'xlim_changed'.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
