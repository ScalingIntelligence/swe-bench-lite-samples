The issue specifically points to the 'set_xlim' method in '_base.py' where the 'emit=False' parameter is used when calling 'set_xlim' on sibling axes. This prevents the 'xlim_changed' callback from being triggered, leading to the described behavior. \n\nFrom the search results, I identified the relevant code spans that directly address the issue. The 'set_xlim' method is critical as it contains the logic where 'emit=False' is used when updating the limits of shared axes. This method is found in the code span with id '_AxesBase.set_xlim'. Additionally, the 'sharex' method, which manages the shared axes, is also relevant as it involves the interaction between axes that are shared. This method can be found in the code span with id '_AxesBase.sharex'. These identified methods are directly responsible for managing the axis limits and sharing mechanisms in the matplotlib library, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.\n\nGiven the search results, it appears that the crucial code sections related to the issue have been identified. These sections include the 'set_xlim' and 'sharex' methods, which handle the limit setting and axis sharing functionalities, respectively. With these relevant code spans identified, further analysis or changes could be directed to address the 'xlim_changed' callback issue effectively.",

Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n"
