These functions are central to understanding how partial fraction decomposition is handled within SymPy. Initial inspection of the provided code spans indicates that they directly relate to these functionalities. However, they do not cover the entirety of the relevant code for a full understanding. There may be additional utility or helper functions used within these spans that could affect the outcome of the 'apart' function, which are not listed here.
