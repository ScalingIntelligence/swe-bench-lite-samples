Given the provided context, there are four main files that could be relevant: 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py', 'sympy/core/expr.py', 'sympy/core/add.py', and 'sympy/core/mul.py', as they contain functions and classes directly related to expression simplification and polynomial operations. It's also important to check for any handling of symbolic variables and substitutions, which are critical given the nature of the bug report. Therefore, further inspection of these files and their related functionalities is necessary. Additionally, the version of SymPy used (1.0) might be relevant if there have been updates or fixes related to the 'apart' function in later versions. Therefore, checking for similar issues in the SymPy issue tracker or changelog might provide additional context.",
