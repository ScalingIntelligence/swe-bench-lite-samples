The key function here is 'apart' which is responsible for performing partial fraction decomposition on expressions. By examining the search results, the 'apart' method is located in 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py'. Additionally, there is relevant code in 'sympy/core/expr.py' that pertains to the 'Expr' class, which likely interacts with the 'apart' method since the expression on which 'apart' is called is an instance of 'Expr'. The 'Expr' class also contains methods like 'as_independent', 'series', and 'integrate' which could potentially influence the behavior of 'apart' or be influenced by it. Furthermore, in 'sympy/core/mul.py', there are methods within the 'Mul' class that are relevant, such as 'flatten', '_eval_evalf', 'as_numer_denom', and '_eval_is_algebraic_expr', among others. These methods handle various aspects of multiplication and could affect the expression preprocessing or postprocessing involved in 'apart'.\n\nGiven the complex nature of the 'apart' method and its interactions with other components of SymPy, it is crucial to review not just isolated code spans but entire methods and potentially neighboring code to fully understand the context and implications of changes. As such, the identified spans represent a comprehensive view tailored to the reported issue, ensuring that all relevant parts of the codebase are considered for a thorough investigation and resolution.",
