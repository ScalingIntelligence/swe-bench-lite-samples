It seems that the `apart` method may not be correctly factoring or simplifying these expressions. To diagnose this, we should focus on the `apart` method and related functionalities in the `sympy` library. The error occurs when `apart` is called on an expression containing `t`, and it returns an unexpected result (`-a*t` instead of the expected factored form). Based on the provided context, we can start by searching for the implementation of the `apart` method and related functions like `apart_list` and `apart_undetermined_coeffs`. Additionally, since `apart` might involve operations on polynomials or rational functions, it would be beneficial to check related modules such as `polys`, `series`, and `integrals`, as they may contain underlying logic for the `apart` method.",
