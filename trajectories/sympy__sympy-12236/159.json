The 'apart' method is used for partial fraction decomposition, and the problem seems to occur specifically with certain expressions involving symbols 'a' and 't'. The main focus of the search should be on identifying the code related to the 'apart' method and its implementations. From the provided search results, the relevant files are 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py' and 'sympy/core/expr.py'. In 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py', the 'apart' function and its related helper functions 'apart_undetermined_coeffs' and 'apart_full_decomposition' are found. These are directly related to the partial fraction decomposition, which is central to the reported issue. In 'sympy/core/expr.py', there is an 'Expr.apart' method that simply calls the 'apart' function from the 'sympy.polys' module, which aligns with the use of 'apart' in the reported issue. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the issue.",
