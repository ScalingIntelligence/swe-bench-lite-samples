These functions are directly responsible for implementing the partial fraction decomposition functionality. Additionally, the 'Expr' class in 'sympy/core/expr.py' is relevant because it includes methods like 'integrate', 'ratsimp', 'powsimp', 'combsimp', and 'factor', which could interact with or be affected by the 'apart' method. The 'solveset.py' file, particularly the 'substitution' function, is also examined because it might involve solving equations, which could be related to the 'apart' method's operation. The 'imports' sections in various files are also noted because they indicate which functionalities are being utilized.
