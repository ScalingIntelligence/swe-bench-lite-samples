The codebase analysis revealed multiple relevant sections, primarily in 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py' and 'sympy/core/expr.py'. In 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py', the 'apart' function definition and its helper functions, 'apart_undetermined_coeffs' and 'apart_full_decomposition', are crucial as they directly deal with partial fraction decomposition. These functions handle the decomposition of rational functions and might be where the issue lies. In 'sympy/core/expr.py', the 'Expr.apart' method is a wrapper calling the 'apart' function from 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py', indicating that this method is used to apply partial fraction decomposition to instances of 'Expr'. Given the issue's focus on incorrect results and the demonstrated use of 'apart' in the provided IPython session, these identified sections are highly relevant for further investigation and potential fixes.",

Each quadruple\n+      has the following elements in this order:\n+\n+      - The (not necessarily irreducible) polynomial `D` whose roots `w_i` appear\n+        in the linear denominator of a bunch of related fraction terms. (This item\n+        can also be a list of explicit roots. However, at the moment ``apart_list``\n+        never returns a result this way, but the related ``assemble_partfrac_list``\n+        function accepts this format as input.)\n+\n+      - The numerator of the fraction, written as a function of the root `w`\n+\n+      - The linear denominator of the fraction *excluding its power exponent*,\n+        written as a function of the root `w`.\n+\n+      - The power to which the denominator has to be raised.\n+\n+    On can always rebuild a plain expression by using the function ``assemble_partfrac_list``.\n+\n+    Examples\n+    ========\n+\n+    A first example:\n+\n+    >>> from sympy.polys.partfrac import apart_list, assemble_partfrac_list\n+    >>> from sympy.abc import x, t\n+\n+    >>> f = (2*x**3 - 2*x) / (x**2 - 2*x + 1)\n+    >>> pfd = apart_list(f)\n+    >>> pfd\n+    (1,\n+    Poly(2*x + 4, x, domain='ZZ'),\n+    [(Poly(_w - 1, _w, domain='ZZ'), Lambda(_a, 4), Lambda(_a, -_a + x), 1)])\n+\n+    >>> assemble_partfrac_list(pfd)\n+    2*x + 4 + 4/(x - 1)\n+\n+    Second example:\n+\n+    >>> f = (-2*x - 2*x**2) / (3*x**2 - 6*x)\n+    >>> pfd = apart_list(f)\n+    >>> pfd\n+    (-1,\n+    Poly(2/3, x, domain='QQ'),\n+    [(Poly(_w - 2, _w, domain='ZZ'), Lambda(_a, 2), Lambda(_a, -_a + x), 1)])\n+\n+    >>> assemble_partfrac_list(pfd)\n+    -2/3 - 2/(x - 2)\n+\n+    Another example, showing symbolic parameters:\n+\n+    >>> pfd = apart_list(t/(x**2 + x + t), x)\n+    >>> pfd\n+    (1,\n+    Poly(0, x, domain='ZZ[t]'),\n+    [(Poly(_w**2 + _w + t, _w, domain='ZZ[t]'),\n+    Lambda(_a, -2*_a*t/(4*t - 1) - t/(4*t - 1)),\n+    Lambda(_a, -_a + x),\n+    1)])\n+\n+    >>> assemble_partfrac_list(pfd)\n+    RootSum(_w**2 + _w + t, Lambda(_a, (-2*_a*t/(4*t - 1) - t/(4*t - 1))/(-_a + x)))\n+\n+    This example is taken from Bronstein's original paper:\n+\n+    >>> f = 36 / (x**5 - 2*x**4 - 2*x**3 + 4*x**2 + x - 2)\n+    >>> pfd = apart_list(f)\n+    >>> pfd\n+    (1,\n+    Poly(0, x, domain='ZZ'),\n+    [(Poly(_w - 2, _w,\n     else:\n         P, Q = f.as_numer_denom()\n \n. \nErrors:\nThe updated code is invalid.\nMake sure that you return the unchanged code in the replace tag exactly as it is.
