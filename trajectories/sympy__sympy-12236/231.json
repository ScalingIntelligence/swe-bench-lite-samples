Specifically, the 'apart' method itself is identified in both files, along with supporting functions like 'apart_undetermined_coeffs' and 'apart_full_decomposition'. These are directly related to the functionality of polynomial partial fraction decomposition, which is central to the issue reported. Additionally, the 'apart' method in sympy/core/expr.py is a wrapper that calls the 'apart' function from sympy/polys/partfrac.py, which is crucial for understanding the integration and workflow of the 'apart' functionality.
