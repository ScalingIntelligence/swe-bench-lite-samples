The search should focus on the 'apart' function and related methods in the SymPy codebase. The relevant files identified so far include 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py', 'sympy/series/formal.py', 'sympy/core/expr.py', and others. To pinpoint the exact source of the issue, we should search for the 'apart' method across these files and possibly others that interact closely with polynomial or rational function manipulation.",
