The relevant files and snippets provided suggest that the 'apart' function is part of the polys module in SymPy. Additionally, the 'expr' module and 'exprtools' module are likely to be involved due to the nature of the issue regarding expressions. The 'apart' function in 'partfrac.py', 'Expr' class in 'expr.py', and possibly 'Mul' and 'Add' classes in their respective files will be key to resolving this issue. Therefore, the search should focus on these modules and the specific function 'apart'.",
