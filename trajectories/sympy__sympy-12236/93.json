Given the problem description and the provided context, it's likely that the issue lies within the implementation of the `apart` function or related functions in the `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` file. This is supported by the existence of functions like `apart`, `apart_undetermined_coeffs`, and `apart_list` in that module. Additionally, since the `apart` function might interact with other parts of the codebase, it's prudent to check related functionalities such as series expansion, simplification, and symbolic computation in other relevant files mentioned in the context, though the primary focus should remain on the `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` file.",
