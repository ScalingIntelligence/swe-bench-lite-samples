The search results include several files and spans of code that deal with partial fraction decomposition, expression handling, and series expansion. The relevant code spans for the `apart()` method are found in `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. Specifically, the `apart()` function definition and its associated methods in `partfrac.py` are directly related to the functionality mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the `apart()` method within the `Expr` class in `core/expr.py` also aligns with the reported issue as it is the high-level interface for the `apart()` functionality. Other files and spans, such as those dealing with series expansion or unrelated parts of the library, are not directly relevant to the reported issue concerning `.apart()`.",
