The relevant context here is the functionality related to partial fraction decomposition, primarily within the `partfrac.py` module where the `apart` function is defined. Due to the specific nature of the problem, centered around discrepancies in the `apart` function, it is crucial to investigate the implementation and related methods within `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`. Additionally, checking the `mul.py`, `expr.py`, and `add.py` modules for any interactions with expressions that might be relevant when the `apart` method is invoked could provide deeper insights.",

From the search results, we see that the `apart` method is defined in `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`. Additionally, there are several spans in `sympy/core/mul.py` that deal with multiplication and its associated operations, which could be pertinent to understanding how `apart` interacts with these operations.
