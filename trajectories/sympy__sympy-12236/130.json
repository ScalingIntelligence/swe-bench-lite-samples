The 'apart' method is responsible for performing partial fraction decomposition on rational functions. The issue identifies a discrepancy in the results when the 'apart' method is applied to a specific expression involving symbolic variables 'a' and 't'. This discrepancy can be traced to the implementation of the 'apart' method in the SymPy library, particularly its handling of multivariate polynomial division and partial fraction decomposition. The provided file context and search results highlight key functions involved in this process such as 'apart' and 'apart_undetermined_coeffs'.
