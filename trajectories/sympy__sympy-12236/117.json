The issue specifically occurs when applying 'apart' to a specific expression, yielding an incorrect result. The method 'apart' is responsible for performing partial fraction decomposition on a rational function. By examining the search results, it is evident that the method 'apart' is defined in the file 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py'. The relevant code spans include the method 'apart' itself and the '_eval_subs' methods in various classes, which are also likely to be involved in the substitution and evaluation process. These classes include 'Basic', 'Application', 'Derivative', 'Subs', 'Pow', 'Mul', and 'Add'. The '_eval_subs' methods are crucial for substituting values in expressions, which is a necessary step when checking the correctness of the partial fraction decomposition. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",

These functions are directly related to the decomposition process within 'apart' and could be where the issue arises.

The issue seems to be with the implementation of the 'apart' function or related sub-functions that handle the decomposition process. From the search results, we see multiple spans of code from sympy/polys/partfrac.py and sympy/series/formal.py that deal with the 'apart' function and its related algorithms. We should focus on these spans as they are directly related to the functionality under question. Additionally, the code spans from sympy/polys/partfrac.py include implementations of 'apart', 'apart_undetermined_coeffs', 'apart_list', and 'assemble_partfrac_list', which indicate a high likelihood of containing the problem or being closely related to it. The rational_algorithm in sympy/series/formal.py also uses the 'apart' function and could be another point of interest. These spans should be analyzed to determine if there are any issues in the logic or implementation of the partial fraction decomposition that could be leading to the wrong results as reported. If necessary, further spans from these files or related functions could be examined to more accurately pinpoint the source of the problem. The analysis should include checking the logic for calculating the coefficients, the handling of different cases like multivariate polynomials, and the integration of results into the final expression.",
