The problem might lie in the implementation of the `apart` function or related methods handling polynomial or rational function decomposition. Relevant files identified include 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py' and 'sympy/series/formal.py', which are likely to contain the `apart` function and related algorithms. Further examination of these files and possibly others like 'sympy/core/expr.py' for any general assertion failures in expression handling might uncover the root cause.",

The key focus is to identify the code related to the 'apart' function and the logic it employs for partial fraction decomposition. In the search results, the 'apart' function is found in 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py' within the span id 'apart'. Additionally, 'apart' is referenced in 'sympy/series/formal.py' in the 'rational_algorithm' function, suggesting the relevance to the reported issue for handling rational functions. The other spans in 'sympy/series/formal.py' related to transformations and computing the formal power series (fps) may not directly pertain to fixing the 'apart' function's issue but are essential for understanding the broader context of how 'apart' might be used in the codebase. For now, focusing on 'apart' implementation and its usage in rational_algorithm seems sufficient, but further investigation into how these other functions might impact 'apart' should be considered if the initial identified code doesn't resolve the issue.",
