        "message": "The changes applied address the initial concern of inconsistent behavior in the 'apart' method of the sympy library by ensuring that the input expression 'f' is sympified early in the function. This approach aligns with the observed problem where inconsistent results were coming from not properly handling the input expressions before decomposition. By sympifying 'f' twice, the function expects 'f' to already be in a sympified form, which reinforces the robustness of the 'apart' method against differently formatted input expressions.",
