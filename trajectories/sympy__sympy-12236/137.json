The user is specifically encountering problems with the `apart` method, which is used to perform partial fraction decomposition. The provided search results include several relevant files and spans of code, each potentially related to the `apart` function or closely associated with it. Specifically, the `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` files contain spans directly related to the `apart` function and expression handling, respectively. The other files involve series operations and integration processes that could indirectly influence the behavior of the `apart` method.\n\nFor the `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` file, the span labeled 'apart' directly contains the definition of the `apart` function. This span is crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue as it includes the core logic of the `apart` method and handles the overall functionality of partial fraction decomposition.\n\nIn the `sympy/core/expr.py` file, various spans are associated with the `Expr` class and its methods. The methods such as `integrate`, `ratsimp`, `powsimp`, `combsimp`, and `factor` are pertinent because they could interact with the `apart` function leading to the observed behavior. While none of these spans directly define the `apart` function, they contribute to the broader context in which expressions are manipulated and simplified\u2014operations essential to the correct functioning of the `apart` method.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, it is crucial to consider not only the direct implementation of the `apart` function but also how it interfaces with other expression-handling functionalities. This broader contextual approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the issue and aids in determining its root cause.\n\nTherefore, the identified spans include the `apart` definition from `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` and various expression-handling methods from `sympy/core/expr.py`. These are marked as relevant since they directly or indirectly contribute to the functionality of the `apart` function as described in the reported issue.",
