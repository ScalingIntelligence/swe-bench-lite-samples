To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the `apart` function and any related operations involving symbolic manipulation and polynomial handling. From the search results, the `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` file contains the definition of the `apart` function and its sub-functions, which are likely central to resolving the issue. Additionally, the `sympy/core/add.py` file contains the `Add` class, which is potentially involved in how expressions are handled before applying `apart`. Both files are relevant due to their direct involvement in the operations mentioned in the issue. Specific spans in `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` such as `apart`, `apart_undetermined_coeffs`, and the import section are particularly relevant for understanding and fixing the `apart` function's behavior. In `sympy/core/add.py`, `Add` class related spans might provide context on how addition operations are treated, possibly influencing the `apart` function's result.",
