To address this issue, we need to look for code spans that involve the implementation and handling of the `apart` function and any related methods or utilities in the search results. After analyzing the search results, the following key sections appear relevant: 1. The definition of the `apart` function in `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` under the span ID 'apart'. 2. The `Expr` class and its `series` method in `sympy/core/expr.py`, which might be related to handling symbolic expressions and series expansion, though not directly related to `apart`. However, since `apart` involves partial fraction decomposition, which is closely related to polynomial manipulations, understanding the entire section including the function definition is crucial. 3. Imports and utility functions related to polynomial manipulations in `sympy/polys/polyfuncs.py` and parts of `sympy/polys/compatibility.py`, indicating broader context of algebraic operations, which might not be directly relevant but provide foundational knowledge for the task.
