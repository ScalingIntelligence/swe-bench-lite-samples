The `apart` function is responsible for performing partial fraction decomposition on a given expression.

Given this, the relevant code spans to identify would be those that implement or directly interact with the `apart` function. The search results provide two relevant spans: one is the definition of the `apart` function itself, and the other two are helper functions `apart_undetermined_coeffs` and `apart_full_decomposition` that are used within the `apart` function for handling different cases. These spans appear to be directly related to the implementation of the `apart` functionality and thus are likely relevant to the reported issue.",
