The two key methods to focus on are Expr.apart and the corresponding partfrac.apart function which implements the apart functionality. We need to examine the behavior of these functions and identify any issues.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate the Expr.apart method which directly calls sympy.polys.apart. This provides a direct link to the core functionality related to partial fraction decomposition, which is a main part of the reported issue.\n\nSecondly, within sympy/polys/partfrac.py, the apart function is the central piece that performs the actual decomposition of rational functions into partial fractions. The function apart_undetermined_coeffs is also relevant as it is responsible for handling the case of undetermined coefficients during the decomposition process.\n\nThese methods might not directly contain the bug reported, but they are crucial as they set the foundation for how partial fraction decomposition is executed. If there's an issue with how the expression in the bug report is being handled, it's likely these methods would be involved or would need adjustments to accommodate any new functionality or fixes adjacent to the bug.\n\nOn the surface, everything aligns with the reported issue. Now we need to establish if this search result is sufficient or if it should be expanded to potentially uncover more relevant methods.",
