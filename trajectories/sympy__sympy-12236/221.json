            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves incorrect results when using the 'apart' method in SymPy. The example provided demonstrates that the 'apart' method fails to correctly decompose the expression when symbol 'a' is present. This suggests that the issue might be related to the handling of multiplication involving 'a' and the transformation logic within the 'apart' method. The search results include several relevant files and spans:\n\n1. `sympy/core/mul.py` contains the `Mul` class which is likely responsible for the multiplication operations in SymPy. It includes several methods such as `_eval_subs`, `_matches`, `matches`, and others that handle substitution, matching, and evaluation of multiplications.\n\n2. `sympy/core/expr.py` includes the `Expr` class, which is the base class for all SymPy expressions, including those handled by `apart`. Specifically, the `apart` method is defined here, which delegates to the `apart` function in `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`.\n\n3. `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` contains the actual implementation of the `apart` function. This function is responsible for performing partial fraction decomposition on rational functions. The function handles the decomposition, including cases where the input is a multivariate polynomial, which might be relevant for understanding and addressing the reported issue.\n\n4. The `_eval_subs` method in `Mul` class is particularly relevant as it deals with substitution, which is a fundamental operation when performing algebraic manipulations and decompositions like partial fraction decomposition. The presence of complex logic dealing with differences in multiplication factors (both commutative and noncommutative) suggests that this area might be related to the reported wrong results.\n\nConsidering these factors, the relevant spans to investigate further include those within the `Mul` class in `sympy/core/mul.py`, specifically the `_eval_subs` and related methods, as well as the `apart` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` and its implementation in `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`.",
