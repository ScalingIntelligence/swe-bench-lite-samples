This error typically arises when attempting to call an instance of Function without defining its functional behavior. The 'u' function in the context seems to be a placeholder for unknown functions. To resolve this, it's necessary to ensure 'u' is correctly defined or used as a placeholder within the scope of functions that handle the specific expressions or operations where it appears. However, since the focus is on the 'apart' function, especially around the handling of 'RootSum' in the partial fraction decomposition, it's important to ensure that any placeholders or functions used there are correctly incorporated without causing type errors. For now, since the immediate context doesn't directly involve line 378, it might be more prudent to focus on ensuring the 'apart' function correctly handles the reported issue without introducing such errors elsewhere. Thus, the current task doesn't call for direct modification outside of the 'apart' function's scope if it doesn't affect the resolved issue. If further issues arise directly linked to the 'apart' function after applying the fix, they should be addressed in the same iterative manner. The current focus doesn't extend to an overall review or alteration of unrelated functions unless they directly impact the resolved issue.",
