Specifically, the issue focuses on the behavior of the 'apart' method when dealing with symbolic expressions involving variables 'a' and 't'. The incorrect results observed are: when substituting 'a' with 1, the 'apart' method does not produce the expected partial fraction decomposition. From the provided search results, the most relevant code spans are those directly related to the 'apart' method implementation (\"sympy/polys/partfrac.py\" and \"sympy/core/expr.py\").\n\nIn \"sympy/polys/partfrac.py\", the 'apart' method is defined, which is likely where the issue lies. The method 'apart' is responsible for breaking a rational function into its partial fraction decomposition. The code in this file processes the input expression, tries to parallelize polynomial processing, and handles various exceptional cases as well.\n\nIn \"sympy/core/expr.py\", there are several relevant spans such as 'Expr.series', 'Expr.ratsimp', and 'Expr.powsimp'. These methods are related to expression simplification and series expansion, which could potentially be involved or interact with the 'apart' method, although they are not directly related to the issue at hand.\n\nNo relevant code spans were found in \"sympy/simplify/ratsimp.py\" or \"sympy/series/formal.py\" that are directly related to the 'apart' method's implementation or handling of symbolic expressions relevant to the issue reported.\n\nGiven the context, the 'apart' method in \"sympy/polys/partfrac.py\" is identified as the most relevant and likely source of the issue. Other methods related to expressions in \"sympy/core/expr.py\" could also be considered but are of secondary relevance compared to the direct 'apart' method implementation.",
