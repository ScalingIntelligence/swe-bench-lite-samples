The user provided example demonstrates that the 'apart' function does not produce the expected partial fraction decomposition for a given expression. Analyzing the search results, we can locate the definition of the 'apart' function in 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py', which is likely where the issue originates. The function 'apart_undetermined_coeffs' within 'partfrac.py' is particularly relevant because it deals with the partial fraction decomposition method that seems to be failing. Additionally, the 'Expr.apart' method in 'sympy/core/expr.py' is a wrapper for the 'apart' function from 'partfrac', indicating where the interface for this functionality is implemented in SymPy's core expression handling.
