The incorrect result is observed when calling `bug.apart(t)`. The provided context only includes the `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` file, which contains the implementation of the `apart` function. The analysis of the current implementation does not reveal any obvious issues related to the reported bug. The code correctly handles the separation of terms and their decomposition. However, the reported issue suggests that the function is not behaving as expected with the given input. It is likely that the issue could be due to the way the terms are being simplified or combined after decomposition. The current implementation of `apart` checks the degrees of polynomials and proceeds with either full decomposition or undetermined coefficients method based on the `full` flag. This approach seems logically correct but might not handle certain forms of expressions correctly. Given the context and the behavior described in the issue, a possible solution could be to enhance the simplification step after partial fraction decomposition to ensure that all terms are correctly accounted for and combined.",
