These functions are directly related to the partial fraction decomposition functionality that is failing as reported in the issue. Additionally, the `sympy/core/expr.py` file contains the `Expr.apart` method, which is a wrapper or interface to the `apart` function from the `sympy.polys` module. This confirms that the `apart` method in the `Expr` class is indeed the entry point for the partial fraction decomposition functionality in SymPy. Thus, the identified code spans are directly relevant to the issue reported.",
