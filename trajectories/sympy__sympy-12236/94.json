The issue seems to involve incorrect results when using the 'apart' method on a specific expression involving symbolic variables 'a' and 't'. Specifically, the output of 'bug.apart(t)' does not match the expected partial fraction decomposition. Given the nature of the issue, the relevant code spans are likely to be found in the 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py' file, which is focused on partial fraction decomposition. The search results do indeed contain the implementations of the 'apart', 'apart_undetermined_coeffs', 'apart_full_decomposition', and 'apart_list' functions, all of which are closely related to the functionality under question. These functions handle various aspects of the partial fraction decomposition process, including determining coefficients, handling full decompositions, and managing the overall list-based decomposition approach. Further, the 'assemble_partfrac_list' function is crucial for assembling the final result from partial fractions. Therefore, these code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue and should be sufficient to understand and potentially fix the problem.",

Similarly, 'sympy/core/expr.py' contains the base implementation for expressions and series expansion, which might be indirectly involved if the issue relates to how expressions are handled in the context of partial fraction decomposition. For completeness, 'sympy/core/function.py' includes functionality for handling function evaluation and series expansion that might also be relevant, particularly concerning how the function behaves in terms of series at 0 and how it might be influencing the 'apart' method's behavior. Given the specificity of the issue to the 'apart' method and the code provided exclusively handling the 'apart' method in the SymPy repository, it seems plausible that the context provided contains all the relevant parts to understand the issue. However, due to the complexity and possibility of interconnected issues across different modules (not fully present in the provided context), further investigation might still be warranted.
