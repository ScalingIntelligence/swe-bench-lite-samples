This suggests that the problem lies within the 'apart' function or its related functionalities in the polynomial manipulation module. Given the context provided, it's crucial to focus on the 'apart' function in the 'polys' module and its interactions with symbolic expressions. The 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py' file seems particularly relevant, as it contains the 'apart' function implementation. Other files like 'sympy/core/expr.py' and 'sympy/core/mul.py' might also be relevant due to their handling of symbolic expressions and multiplication, respectively.",
