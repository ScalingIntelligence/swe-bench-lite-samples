The issue is demonstrated in an interactive Python session where the `apart` function returns unexpectedresults when applied to a given expression. Key elements of the issue include the `apart` function and the expressions it operates on. The issue also involves symbols such as `a` and `t` which are defined as real and non-negative respectively. Based on the issue, it is clear that the `apart` function's behavior needs to be investigated and potentially corrected. The provided search results contain multiple code spans from files within the SymPy codebase, especially `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. These files include definitions and implementations relevant to the `apart` function, which is listed under the `apart` span in `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`. Additionally, there are specific implementations for `apart_undetermined_coeffs` and `apart_full_decomposition` in the same file that may be related to the functionality of `apart`. The `Expr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py`, which is likely to be the base class for expressions handled by `apart`, also includes a method for `apart`. Given the relevance of these code spans, they are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
