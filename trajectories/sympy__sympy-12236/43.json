The 'apart' function produces incorrect results when applied directly to the expression. \n2. The expected result differs from the actual output from 'apart', suggesting a potential bug in the implementation or logic of the 'apart' function.\n\nGiven the context, the search focuses on identifying sections of code in the 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py' file that pertain to the 'apart' function and its related methods (like 'apart_undetermined_coeffs', 'apart_full_decomposition', etc.). These sections are crucial for understanding the logic and processes involved in performing partial fraction decomposition, which is the core functionality of the 'apart' function.\n\nBy examining the current context and new search results, I identified the necessary code spans from 'partfrac.py' that are interconnected and directly related to the 'apart' function and its processing. These spans include the 'apart', 'apart_undetermined_coeffs', and 'apart_full_decomposition' methods, which handle different aspects of the decomposition process.\n\nThis thorough examination is necessary because the 'apart' function's correctness depends on not just its immediate implementation, but also on how subsidiary functions interact with it. The identified code spans cover relevant areas for addressing the incorrectly functioning 'apart' function, providing a comprehensive view of the potential source(s) of the issue.\n\nThe response below reflects the identified spans as relevant code sections that should be reviewed and potentially amended to address the reported issue.",
