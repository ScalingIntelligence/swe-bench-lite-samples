The problem might stem from how the `apart` function handles symbolic expressions or possibly due to an issue within the function itself. Given the focus on the `apart` function, it's logical to search for related code within the `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` module, where the `apart` function is likely defined or used. Additionally, the `apart_list` function from the same module might also be relevant, as it is related to partial fraction decomposition. Other related files such as `sympy/core/expr.py` and `sympy/series/formal.py` should also be considered due to their potential involvement in expression handling and series expansion respectively, which are operations closely tied to partial fractions.",

The user provided an example that demonstrates the discrepancy between expected and actual results when applying 'apart' to a specific expression. To address this, it's crucial to identify the code spans that are responsible for handling the 'apart' functionality within the library. By examining the search results, one can observe that the 'apart' method is primarily contained within the 'sympy/polys/partfrac.py' file, specifically in the 'apart' span. This is essential for understanding and possibly fixing the bug. Additionally, relevant code spans in 'sympy/core/expr.py' concern methods like 'as_numer_denom', which is used by 'apart' to handle the numerator and denominator of the expression. These spans are highly relevant to the reported issue as they directly influence the way expressions are processed by 'apart'. It is also worth noting interactions with other modules like 'sympy/series/formal.py', where the 'rational_algorithm' function also uses 'apart', albeit at a deeper level not directly relevant for surface-level bug inspection. The focus should thus be on the directly controllable components: the 'apart' function itself and its immediate dependencies in 'expr.py'. These are the chunks of code where the bug can be initially investigated and potentially fixed.",
