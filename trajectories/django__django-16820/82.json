Given the nature of the issue, it is crucial to identify code spans within the migration framework that handle the transition of indexes, especially focusing on sections that rename indexes or alter the index_together attribute. The search results provide several relevant sections from a file named `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`. These sections include methods handling the renaming of indexes (`generate_renamed_indexes`) and altering the `index_together` attribute (`generate_removed_altered_index_together` and `generate_altered_index_together`). These methods directly relate to transitioning and manipulating indexes, which are central to addressing the deprecation warnings mentioned in the issue. Since no context has been provided yet in the file_context, all these sections are considered relevant for addressing the issue, especially because they are critical parts of the Django migration auto-detection logic.",
