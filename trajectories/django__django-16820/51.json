To address this, we need to locate the relevant code that handles these transitions and updates migrations accordingly. From the provided context, it's clear that the concern spans multiple files, including those that deal with migration auto-detection, model operations, schema editing, and model options. Specifically, we should focus on the functions and classes that manage unique and index together alterations, as well as those that handle migration optimization and squashing. This includes the `MigrationAutodetector`, `AlterIndexTogether`, `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, and `Command` classes, among others. By targeting these areas, we can identify where the transition logic needs to be updated to remove deprecation warnings.",

The code spans include the initial import statements, the MigrationAutodetector class definition, and several methods within this class that handle various migration operations, such as detecting changes, optimizing migrations, and generating alterations related to index_together. Specifically, the methods generate_removed_altered_index_together and generate_altered_index_together are directly related to handling changes in index_together, which are crucial for addressing the deprecation warnings mentioned in the issue.
