Examining the provided search results, the focus should be on methods related to handling `index_together` during migration processing and its transition to `indexes`. From the search results, two main methods stand out as relevant: `generate_removed_altered_index_together` and `generate_altered_index_together` in `MigrationAutodetector`, as they specifically handle changes related to `index_together`. Additionally, `alter_index_together` in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` is crucial as it directly deals with altering the index together settings in the database schema, which aligns with the issue of transitioning from `index_together` to `indexes` during migration squashing. These methods are vital for understanding how Django manages the transition and could possibly contain the logic needed to address or further develop a solution that removes these deprecation warnings.",
