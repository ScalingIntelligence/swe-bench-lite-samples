The provided file context and search results include several key components necessary to understand and implement this transition.

These methods could be potential places where updates or removals of `index_together` are handled.\n\nOverall, the key elements to focus on are the transition of `index_together` to `indexes`, and the handling of these changes within the migration operations and project state management. The identified code spans from `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and `django/db/migrations/state.py` appear to be directly related to the management and alteration of model options that are subject to deprecation warnings.
