            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves removing deprecation warnings related to the transition from Meta.index_together to Meta.indexes in Django migrations. This involves understanding how these operations are handled in the migration framework. From the search results, there are several key areas of interest:\n\n1. **AlterIndexTogether class** and its related methods in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`: This class directly handles changes to the `index_together` option, which is relevant to the issue. The `AlterIndexTogether` class has a method `__init__` that initializes the operation with the new `index_together` values, indicating how these changes are initiated.\n\n2. **RenameIndex class** and its `state_forwards` method in the same file: This handles renaming of indexes and interacts with the state to either add a new index or rename an existing one. This is particularly relevant as it shows how existing indexes might be modified to remove deprecation warnings.\n\n3. **MigrationAutodetector class** and its `generate_removed_altered_index_together` method in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`: This method specifically deals with generating operations that alter or remove `index_together`, providing a direct link to how migration auto-detection handles these specific deprecation-related changes.\n\nThis analysis indicates that both files and the mentioned code spans show how Django handles and processes migrations specifically for altering or removing `index_together`, which directly addresses the issue of deprecation warnings. Therefore, these spans are highly relevant to resolving the reported issue.",
