The search results include several key sections from Django's migration handling code:\n\n1. `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` includes methods for detecting altered indexes (`create_altered_indexes`), generating operations related to removed or altered index_together (`generate_removed_altered_index_together`), and generating operations for altered index_together (`generate_altered_index_together`). These sections directly relate to detecting and handling changes involving index_together, which is crucial for addressing the deprecation warnings.\n\n2. `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` includes `alter_index_together`, which defines the SQL operations necessary to alter index_together in the database schema. This is an essential part of the migration process for transitioning from index_together to indexes.\n\n3. `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py` includes the logic for squashing migrations, which is directly related to the problem of removing deprecation warnings by combining and optimizing migrations. The `handle` method covers the process of consolidating and rewriting migrations, potentially removing the underlying causes for the deprecation warnings.\n\nThese sections of the codebase are highly relevant as they directly address the process of handling, detecting, and squashing migrations involving index_together, which are key to resolving the reported issue. They provide the necessary foundation for transitioning and consolidating these migrations to eliminate deprecation warnings without needing to rewrite them from scratch. Therefore, these identified spans should be considered as the relevant codebase towards addressing the issue.",
