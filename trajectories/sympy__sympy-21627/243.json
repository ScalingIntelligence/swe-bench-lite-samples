The initial examination of the provided files shows potential entry points in the `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` files, particularly around the `cosh` and `acos` functions involved in the expression. We should also consider looking into `sympy/core/expr.py` as it contains the base `Expr` class from which the hyperbolic and trigonometric functions inherit, and it includes methods like `_eval_is_zero` which might be related to the error. Additionally, `sympy/core/power.py` contains the `Pow` class with an `_eval_is_zero` method that could potentially be involved if the expression simplifies down to a power operation. Finally, `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` is relevant because recursion issues can often arise from simplification processes, and understanding how expressions are simplified to identify zero might provide clues.",
