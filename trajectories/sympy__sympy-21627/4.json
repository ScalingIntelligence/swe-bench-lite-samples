The search results include the `cosh` class definition and an import section that brings in several core SymPy modules and functions. Given the context of the error, the relevant code spans are likely those that involve the `cosh` class and its methods, particularly those related to evaluation. Although the provided search results do not directly include the `is_zero` method or a specific override for it in the `cosh` class, the `cosh._eval_is_finite` method is relevant as it deals with the evaluation of the hyperbolic cosine function and may hint at further methods and overrides within this class or related classes that are involved in checking if the expression is zero. Therefore, it's important to explore further, possibly with extended search results or direct access to the `cosh` class definition, as the recursion issue implies some deep-seated, methodical relationship that currently remains unseen in the provided spans.",

From the <file_context>, it is noticeable that the `cosh` class is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, which includes methods such as `_eval_expand_trig` and `_eval_is_finite`. These methods could potentially be part of the recursion mechanism leading to the error. There is no direct `is_zero` method for `cosh` in the provided context, suggesting that the `is_zero` check might be inherited or handled by a higher-level function or class. In the <search_results>, the file `sympy/core/relational.py` includes classes and functions related to relational operations, which could be used to evaluate whether an expression is zero. Specifically, the `is_eq` function in this file is crucial as it determines if two expressions are equal, which is relevant for checking if an expression is zero. The `_eval_is_eq` and `_eval_is_ge` functions also indicate the evaluation of expression equality and greater-than-or-equal-to relations, which could implicitly handle the zero-checking logic. Given the nature of the error (recursion), focusing on the methods that involve recursive evaluations or deep expansions (such as `_eval_expand_trig`) could be crucial. Therefore, the identified spans in the `cosh` class and the relational operations in `sympy/core/relational.py` are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",
