The key point is understanding how SymPy handles such complex expressions and checks for zero equivalence.\n\nThe search results reveal several files and spans that are potentially relevant. In `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, the `_unpolarify` function deals with polar forms and might be relevant if the expression has polar components. In `sympy/core/expr.py`, the `Expr` class is the base class for expressions in SymPy, and within it, the `_from_mpmath` method converts mpmath values to SymPy expressions, which might be relevant if the expression involves such conversions.\n\nIn `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `Basic` class and its methods like `_recursive_call` and `subs` could be causing the recursion error. The `subs` method especially could be substituting into an expression that leads to infinite recursion. In `sympy/core/sympify.py`, the `sympify` function converts non-SymPy objects into SymPy objects, and the `SympifyError` class handles errors during this conversion. This could be relevant if the expression being checked for zero equivalence involves such conversions.\n\nBased on these observations, the identified code spans are likely to contain the logic relevant to the reported issue. Specifically, the `_unpolarify` and `subs` methods, and the `sympify` function, might be where the recursion error is occurring or propagated.",

These files have functions and methods related to expression evaluation, substitution, and sympification, all of which are central to the reported issue of a recursion depth error when checking if a cosh expression is zero. The presence of methods like `subs` and `_recursive_call` in core.basic suggests that this file deals with the recursive evaluation mechanics that could be causing the recursion depth error. Similarly, functions.elementary.complexes contains functions that might be used in evaluating hyperbolic expressions, which are directly related to the issue. While there isn't a direct method named `is_zero` or a direct check for expression equality to zero in the provided code, the context does cover the areas where such a check would be integrated or triggered. Thus, the provided file context seems to include the necessary parts of the codebase to understand and possibly address the reported issue.",

This suggests that the `is_zero` method might be calling itself recursively without a proper exit condition.

The provided context does not include the `is_zero` method, but we can assume it might be defined in a way that causes this issue.
