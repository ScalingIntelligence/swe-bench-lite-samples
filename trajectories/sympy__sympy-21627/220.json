The reported issue is a RecursionError triggered by the expression `expr.is_zero` when `expr` is a complex hyperbolic trigonometric expression. To address this, it's crucial to find code spans that handle the evaluation of expressions to zero, especially within the context of complex hyperbolic functions. I then reviewed the search results, focusing on code spans within files that handle these specific functionalities. Particularly, the `Expr.is_zero` method within `sympy/core/expr.py`, and related methods in other files like `sympy/core/add.py` and `sympy/core/mul.py` were considered, as they directly relate to the condition being checked. Additionally, spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py` were examined for their relevance to the trigonometric functions and numerical evaluations, respectively.\u00a0\n\nAs no prior relevant code was identified in the file context, each code span within the search results was considered independently for its potential relevance. The identified spans include methods that directly impact the computation of whether an expression is zero and others that influence this decision indirectly, through properties such as being real or finite. After reviewing the entire code sections, the decision to include each span was made based on its relevance to the logic around checking expressions for zero, especially in the context of complex or trigonometric functions.",

This suggests that the `_eval_is_zero` method in the `Expr` class or its subclasses might be causing the infinite recursion. However, the provided context does not directly include the `cosh` or `acosh` functions, focusing instead on general mathematical and trigonometric expressions. It's likely that the recursion is occurring due to mutual recursion between methods trying to evaluate if expressions involving these functions are zero. The complexity arises from the nested nature of these functions combined with the need to check for zero in a recursive manner without causing infinite loops.
