This is likely due to an infinite recursion within the `_eval_is_zero` method of the `cosh` class or a related method. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the zero-checking for `cosh` and other related hyperbolic functions. The search results contain several relevant files and spans, including implementations of `cosh`, `sinh`, `tanh`, `asinh`, `atanh`, and their respective `_eval_is_zero` methods. These are the primary candidates for relevant code spans, as they directly deal with the evaluation and zero-checking of hyperbolic functions, which are central to the reported issue. For completeness, we should also consider the `Pow` and `Add` classes, as expressions involving `cosh` could also be structured using these classes, and their `_eval_is_zero` methods could indirectly contribute to the recursion problem if not handled properly.",

The relevant parts of the code to check are those responsible for evaluating if a hyperbolic function is zero, specifically the `_eval_is_zero` method of the `cosh` class. The current file context does not include the `_eval_is_zero` method for `cosh`, so the search results need to be examined for this method. The search results include the `_eval_is_zero` methods for `sinh`, `tanh`, `asinh`, and `atanh`, but not for `cosh`. Additionally, the `_eval_is_zero` methods in `Pow` and `Add` classes are included, which may be relevant depending on how `cosh` and its arguments are handled. The search results also include `Pow._eval_is_zero`, `Pow.__new__`, `Pow.as_numer_denom`, and `Pow.matches`, which indicate how powers are evaluated for zero. Also included are `Add._eval_is_zero` and `Mul._eval_is_zero`, which determine how additions and multiplications are evaluated for zero. To resolve the issue, it would be beneficial to understand the `cosh` implementation's handling of zero in its `_eval_is_zero` method, but this method is not present in the current file context or search results. It may be necessary to expand the search to find the missing implementation and understand the recursion issue.",
