This error typically occurs due to excessive recursion within the evaluation of the `cosh` function or its related methods. The focus should be on the `cosh` class method and its interactions within the `sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic` module, as well as any methods that might be involved in checking the expression for zero. Additionally, the `sympy.core.expr` module should be examined since it contains methods such as `equals` and `_eval_is_zero` which might be involved in the recursive evaluation.",

            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue of 'maximum recursion depth error when checking is_zero of cosh expression', I focused on analyzing the relevant parts of SymPy's hyperbolic function definitions and expression handling. The error points to a potential issue in the evaluation of the cosh function or the method that checks if an expression is zero. I reviewed the 'cosh' class definition in 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' and the methods within it that could impact the recursive nature of the checks. Some key areas of interest include the 'eval', 'fdiff', and 'is_zero' methods. The 'cosh.eval' and 'cosh.fdiff' methods handle the evaluation and differentiation of the cosh function, respectively, and could lead to recursion if not properly managed. Furthermore, I inspected the 'expr.is_zero' method in 'sympy/core/expr.py', as it is likely involved in determining if the cosh expression is zero. This method is crucial for understanding how SymPy checks for zero values and could contribute to the recursion error seen by the user. After examining the provided code spans, I identified two files with spans that directly pertain to the reported issue. These spans within the 'cosh' class and the 'Expr.equals' method (which indirectly relates to 'is_zero') are critical for investigating the recursion issue.",
