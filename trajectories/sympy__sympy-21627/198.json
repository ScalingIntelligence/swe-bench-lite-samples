Given the context, we need to focus on the `cosh` class and its related methods, especially those related to evaluation (`eval`), expansion (`_eval_expand_trig`), and checking properties like being zero (`_eval_is_zero`). We should also investigate the `acosh` and `acos` classes due to their involvement in the expression. Lastly, the `Expr` class in `core/expr.py` might be relevant for the general expression handling logic.",

Imports and base classes for hyperbolic functions from `sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic`. 2. Definitions of `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, and their respective `_eval_is_zero` methods. 3. An `acos` class from `sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric`, though not directly related to hyperbolic functions, could be indirectly relevant due to the expression involving `acos`. The `cosh` class and its `_eval_is_zero` method are particularly relevant as they directly pertain to the `cosh` function used in the expression. The recursion depth issue most likely arises within the `_eval_is_zero` logic of the `cosh` class. Additionally, the `acos` class could be relevant if the expression being checked involves complex transformations or evaluations.",

The expression in question is `cosh(acos(-i + acosh(-g + i)))`. Upon reviewing the provided search results and the existing file context, several potential areas of interest are identified: 1. The `Pow._eval_is_zero` method in `sympy/core/power.py` is a possible location where the recursion error could occur due to the complexity of evaluating if a power expression is zero. 2. The `Add._eval_is_zero` method in `sympy/core/add.py` and the `Mul._eval_is_zero` method in `sympy/core/mul.py` are also relevant as they evaluate if expressions involving addition and multiplication are zero, which could contribute to the recursion depth error indirectly. 3. The `cosh` and `acos` functions in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, respectively, are directly involved in the expression that causes the error. However, the spans provided for these functions do not directly mention recursion depth issues, focusing more on their mathematical properties and evaluations. Based on this analysis, the identified spans focus on the methods that could be causing or influenced by the recursion error without directly addressing the specific issue of maximum recursion depth. Further examination of these methods to identify specific recursion points or depth limits is recommended for a complete solution.",
