The expression includes cosh and acosh functions, suggesting that the issue may lie in the evaluation or checks within these functions. We need to look into the cosh and acosh classes in sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py, as well as the generic Expr class in sympy/core/expr.py where _eval_is_zero might be defined. To ensure we cover all bases, we should also look at the Pow class in sympy/core/power.py, which might be involved in the evaluation of cosh and acosh. Additionally, as the error occurs during a check for zero, we might need to inspect the relational checks in sympy/core/relational.py. This should give us a comprehensive look into where the recursion might be occurring.",

The key areas to investigate are the `eval` method of the `cosh` class and the evaluation of expressions within the `cosh` class, as these are likely to handle the recursion and evaluation logic. Furthermore, the `acosh` class should also be reviewed as it is part of the expression causing the error. The spans 'cosh.eval' and 'acosh.eval' in the 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' file are most relevant as they directly deal with the evaluation of these functions. Additionally, it's prudent to consider spans related to rewriting expressions in a tractable form, such as 'cosh._eval_rewrite_as_tractable', which might affect how expressions are simplified to avoid recursion errors. The 'sympy/core/power.py' file contains the implementation of the `Pow` class, which might interact with the expressions involving `cosh` and `acosh` during evaluation; relevant spans here include 'Pow._eval_power' and 'Pow._eval_subs'. These spans are crucial as they affect how powers are handled and might contribute to the recursion errors. Finally, the 'sympy/core/relational.py' contains relational operations that might be used in the evaluation checks of the expressions; however, it does not directly deal with the `cosh` or `acosh` functions themselves. Based on the analysis, the spans 'cosh.eval', 'acosh.eval', 'cosh._eval_rewrite_as_tractable', 'Pow._eval_power', and 'Pow._eval_subs' are critical to understanding and potentially fixing the recursion error reported. Thus, these spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
