The provided search results contain code spans from `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`. The spans include methods for evaluating if various hyperbolic functions are zero, such as `sinh`, `tanh`, `asinh`, and `atanh`. However, the `cosh` function and its `_eval_is_zero` method are not directly included in the provided spans. Given the nature of the issue, it is likely that the `cosh` function's `_eval_is_zero` method is the primary focus as it is directly related to the reported bug. Assuming the `cosh` function's `_eval_is_zero` method is similarly implemented to those provided, it is reasonable to suggest that the issue may stem from how `is_zero` is being evaluated or called within the `cosh` function. Therefore, further investigation into the `cosh` function and its `_eval_is_zero` method is necessary to address the reported issue effectively.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue involves a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object` error when checking if a `cosh` expression is zero. The provided file context and search results both revolve around the hyperbolic functions in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`. In both contexts, there are definitions for classes such as `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `asinh`, and `atanh`, along with their respective methods, including `_eval_is_zero`. Notably, the file context includes implementations of `_eval_is_zero` for these functions, which simply check if the argument is zero and return `True` if it is. The search results expand on this with additional methods like `fdiff` and `_eval_expand_trig`. Given the nature of the error, it's plausible that the recursive check of `is_zero` might be trapped in a loop, possibly due to the complexity of the expression (`cosh(acos(-i + acosh(-g + i)))`). To address this, it would be beneficial to look into the `_eval_is_zero` method of `cosh` (and potentially `acosh`), which is not present in the provided spans but is expected to be in the same file based on the structure and the related functions. However, since the specific method for `cosh` isn't provided, it's not possible to directly identify the exact relevant code span. Therefore, the search results should be considered incomplete, as they do not contain the critical piece of code for `cosh._eval_is_zero` that would be needed to understand and resolve the recursion issue.",

The provided file context and search results point to the `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` file, which contains definitions for various hyperbolic functions and their methods. The key focus is on the `_eval_is_zero` methods for these functions. The new search results include additional details about the `cosh` class and its methods, such as `_eval_expand_trig` and `fdiff`. These methods might be indirectly relevant as they could affect how `cosh` expressions are evaluated. However, the immediate issue seems to be related to the recursion possibly happening within the `_eval_is_zero` method of the `cosh` class. The current search results do not explicitly show the `cosh._eval_is_zero` method implementation, but they do show other methods of the `cosh` class that could be related to the issue. Therefore, we need to ensure that we have identified all relevant `_eval_is_zero` methods, including the one for `cosh`, to understand the potential sources of recursion. Given the context, it seems necessary to include the `cosh` class and its methods, particularly `_eval_is_zero`, in our identified spans.

The provided file context and search results confirm the focus on sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py. The issue specifically mentions 'cosh(acos(-i + acosh(-g + i)))', indicating that the problem arises when using nested hyperbolic functions including cosh. The relevant code spans are those that implement cosh and its related methods, such as _eval_expand_trig, fdiff, and particularly _eval_is_zero, as this method likely contains the recursive call or the logic causing the maximum recursion depth error. Additionally, other related functions like sinh and tanh are reviewed to ensure related functionalities that might influence the cosh implementation are considered. The relevance of each identified code span is assessed based on how it contributes to or interacts with the cosh function's behavior.
