This would allow for distinguishing between form field errors, non-field errors within forms, and non-form errors within FormSets. The search results provide relevant classes and methods in the context of FormSets and their management. The 'django/forms/formsets.py' file contains the BaseFormSet class, which includes methods like 'non_form_errors' for handling errors. The 'InlineAdminFormSet' in 'django/contrib/admin/helpers.py' also has a property for non_form_errors. These sections of code are relevant because they deal directly with error management within FormSets and could be modified to include the new CSS class. Additional analysis shows that these classes and methods are central to the issue, and no further code sections are referenced or needed based on the current findings. However, it's important to verify if there are any other relevant parts of the codebase that are necessary for a comprehensive solution. There are no mentions of other parts of the codebase that could be directly relevant in the search results, suggesting that the provided code sections are sufficient for introducing the 'nonform' CSS class.",

The `BaseFormSet` class contains methods and properties related to form errors, including `non_form_errors`. The search results confirm the presence of `BaseFormSet` and its methods, notably `non_form_errors()`, which would likely need modification or extension to include the new `nonform` CSS class. Additionally, the `InlineAdminFormSet` class in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` indirectly references `non_form_errors` from the formset, indicating that this area of the admin helper might also need adjustments. The `ErrorDict` class in `django/forms/utils.py` could potentially be involved in rendering these errors, although direct relevance to the current issue is less clear.

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
