The relevant classes and methods to look for are likely in files related to forms, formsets, and their utility classes. Specifically, methods dealing with errors and their rendering, like `non_form_errors` in `BaseFormSet` and possibly similar methods in other related classes, need to be examined for potential modifications or where the new CSS class can be integrated.",

The reported issue suggests that the current implementation of FormSets does not differentiate non-form errors with a specific CSS class, akin to how non-field errors in Forms are handled. We need to look for sections that deal with error handling and rendering in FormSets, particularly those that involve the `ErrorList` class and the definition of `BaseFormSet`.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided search results, the most relevant sections are found within `django/forms/formsets.py`. The `BaseFormSet` class contains methods and properties that manage error handling and validation, including `non_form_errors()`, `full_clean()`, `clean()`, and `is_valid()`. These methods are crucial for identifying and managing errors, which could be the entry point for adding the `nonform` CSS class. This class and its methods are foundational for handling error scenarios in FormSets, making them the most relevant code spans for addressing the reported issue.\n\nFurthermore, the file context provided does not list any previous relevant files, indicating that this is the first step in identifying relevant code. However, based on the current understanding of the reported issue, the identified code spans are sufficient to initiate a change or enhancement to address the issue.

Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
