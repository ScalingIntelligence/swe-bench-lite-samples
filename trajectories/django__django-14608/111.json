The search results from `django/forms/formsets.py` provide a comprehensive overview of the FormSet class and its related functionalities, including how errors are handled and managed. Specifically, the `BaseFormSet` class and its methods show how non-form errors are computed and stored in the `self._non_form_errors` attribute. This is critical because it indicates the places in the code where the new `nonform` CSS class could be added. Additionally, the `formset_factory` function provides configuration options for FormSets, which is also relevant as any new feature would likely need to be configured here for developers to use. Overall, these sections of the code are directly related to the task of handling and differentiating errors in FormSets, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.",
