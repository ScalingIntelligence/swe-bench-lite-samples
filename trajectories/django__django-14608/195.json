Based on the provided file context, it is evident that the relevant files are `forms.py`, `formsets.py`, `helpers.py`, `models.py`, `utils.py`, and `boundfield.py`. The main focus should be on the `BaseFormSet` and its methods, particularly `non_form_errors`, which need to be modified to include the new CSS class. Additionally, considering the `AdminForm` and `AdminErrorList` in `helpers.py`, these might also need updates to handle the new CSS class for rendering error messages.",

This task involves identifying sections of code in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file that deal with error handling and rendering in FormSets. Key elements include the `BaseFormSet` class and its methods related to error management, such as `non_form_errors` and `full_clean`. These sections are crucial because they define how errors are classified and managed within FormSets. Additionally, examining the initialization and validation processes in `BaseFormSet` and its subclasses, as well as the `formset_factory` function, is essential for grasping the overall context of form error handling. The identified code spans provide a solid basis for implementing the new `nonform` CSS class and ensuring it is appropriately managed and displayed. By focusing on these areas, a developer can effectively extend Django's FormSets to include this new feature, enhancing error message handling and rendering.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
