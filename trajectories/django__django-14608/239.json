The issue suggests adding a CSS class to distinguish non-form errors within FormSets, similar to how non-field errors are handled in forms. \n\nIn the provided search results, the `django/forms/formsets.py` file contains several key spans that are relevant to this issue. These include the `BaseFormSet` class, which is central to the handling of formsets in Django, and its methods like `non_form_errors`, `full_clean`, and `__init__`. These methods deal with the validation and error handling of formsets, making them prime candidates for implementing the new 'nonform' CSS class.\n\nAdditionally, the `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` file contains the `InlineAdminFormSet` class, which uses formsets and includes a `non_form_errors` property. This suggests that errors in formsets are also managed here, making it another relevant location for implementing the new CSS class.\n\nGiven these findings, I will proceed to list the identified spans as relevant to the reported issue.",
