            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about adding a `nonform` CSS class for non form errors in FormSets, similar to the `nonfield` CSS class for non field errors in forms. The goal is to allow custom ErrorList to distinguish between form field errors, non field errors, and non form errors. The key elements in the issue are the CSS class `nonform`, the concept of non form errors, and the desire to distinguish these errors in FormSets for better rendering. \n\nIn the search results, we see relevant code in both `django/forms/formsets.py` and `django/forms/forms.py`. In `formsets.py`, several methods and attributes are relevant to the issue. The `BaseFormSet` class and its methods such as `__init__`, `full_clean`, `clean`, and `non_form_errors` are particularly relevant. These methods handle the cleaning, validation, and error handling of formsets, suggesting that modifications here would be appropriate for adding the `nonform` CSS class. \n\nIn `forms.py`, the `BaseForm` class and its methods like `__init__`, `non_field_errors`, and `add_error` are relevant as they handle similar concepts but for forms, which may serve as a guide for implementing the `nonform` CSS class in FormSets. \n\nGiven these points, it appears that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue. They cover the necessary methods and attributes in both form and formset handling, which are crucial for implementing the `nonform` CSS class.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
