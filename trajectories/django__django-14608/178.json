The goal is to allow custom ErrorList to distinguish between form field errors, non-field errors (in forms), and non-form errors (in FormSets) when rendering error messages. We need to find the relevant parts of the Django codebase where FormSets and error handling are implemented to identify where this enhancement can be applied and documented. From the file context provided, we can see that both `BaseFormSet` and `AdminErrorList` are relevant classes that handle error management. Additionally, `django/forms/utils.py` contains `ErrorList` which might be relevant for this enhancement. However, the file context indicates no files have been found yet, so we need to search for the specific classes and methods mentioned in the issue.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
