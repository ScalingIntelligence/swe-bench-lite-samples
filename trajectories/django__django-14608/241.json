This would allow for a distinction between form field errors, non-field errors (forms), and non-form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. By adding and documenting this CSS class, developers can use it to customize error messages accordingly.\n\nReviewing the search results, I analyzed the code spans in `django/forms/formsets.py` and `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`. The `BaseFormSet` class in `formsets.py` is particularly relevant as it deals with formsets and includes methods for handling errors, such as `non_form_errors()`. This method returns non-form errors, which aligns with the requirement to add the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors. The `formset_factory` function is also relevant as it creates formsets, which could potentially include the new CSS class.\n\nIn `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`, the `InlineAdminFormSet` class also includes a `non_form_errors` property, which accesses non-form errors from the formset. This further supports the need to add the `nonform` CSS class to distinguish non-form errors.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified code spans in both files are relevant to the reported issue, as they deal directly with formsets and their error handling.",
