The issue is about making distinctions in error classes for form field errors, non field errors, and non form errors. From the code provided, the `BaseForm` class in `django/forms.forms.py` already has a method for non field errors (`non_field_errors`) which applies the 'nonfield' CSS class. The `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py` does not currently have any specific method for applying a CSS class to non form errors. To resolve the issue, a new method or update to an existing method in `BaseFormSet` would be necessary to apply the proposed `nonform` CSS class. The relevant sections seem to be `BaseFormSet.__init__` and `BaseFormSet.non_form errors`, as these are likely places where the CSS class assignment could be made. Therefore, I suggest that the resolution would involve modifying `BaseFormSet.` to incorporate the `nonform` class for errors.",
