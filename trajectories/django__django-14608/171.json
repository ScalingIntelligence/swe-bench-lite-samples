The issue specifies the desire to add a 'nonform' CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, similar to how 'nonfield' is used in forms. The search results included code from two files: `django/forms/formsets.py` and `django/forms/forms.py`. In `formsets.py`, the `BaseFormSet` class contains methods such as `non_form_errors` which is directly related to handling errors specific to FormSets. This method sets the stage for adding the proposed 'nonform' CSS class. However, this exact change is not present, suggesting that this is the area where the modification should occur. The `forms.py` file, while related to forms, does not directly impact the issue at hand for FormSets. Thus, while instructive for understanding how to implement a similar feature, it is not directly relevant to the identified task.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
