This would allow developers to distinguish between form field errors, non-field errors within forms, and non-form errors within FormSets when rendering error messages. The key focus here is on modifying FormSets to include this new CSS class in error handling scenarios.\n\n1. Reviewing the `django/forms/formsets.py` file, the `BaseFormSet` class appears to be central to handling errors in FormSets, including managing non-form errors. The `non_form_errors` method in this class is of particular interest as it's responsible for handling errors that are not specific to any individual form.\n2. In `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`, the `InlineAdminFormSet` class references `non_form_errors` from a formset, providing potential integration points for managing FormSet errors in the admin interface context.\n3. The `django/forms/models.py` file contains the `BaseModelFormSet` class, which inherits from `BaseFormSet`, suggesting that changes to error handling there would impact model formsets. However, since the issue does not directly involve model-specific handling, it's of secondary importance to address for now.\n4. Given the context and the reported issue, the most relevant files are `django/forms/formsets.py` and `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`, specifically focused on the handling of non-form errors in the `BaseFormSet` and `InlineAdminFormSet` classes.\n5. To address the issue, the necessary modifications would likely involve:\n   - Updating the `BaseFormSet` class to add the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors.\n   - Ensuring this class is appropriately modified in a way that integrates well with the admin site handling via `InlineAdminFormSet`.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
