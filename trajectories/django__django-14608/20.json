This enhancement would be beneficial for developers when rendering error messages. The search results provide code spans that are relevant to this task. Specifically, the 'BaseFormSet' class in the 'django/forms/formsets.py' file contains multiple spans that are pertinent to handling and managing form errors in FormSets. These include spans such as 'BaseFormSet.__init__', 'BaseFormSet.non_form_errors', 'BaseFormSet.full_clean', and 'BaseFormSet.clean'. Each of these spans is related to error handling within FormSets, particularly for managing non-form errors. They provide context for where the 'nonform' CSS class can be integrated to enhance error reporting in FormSets. The 'BaseFormSet.non_form_errors' method is particularly relevant as it directly relates to the collection and management of non-form errors, suggesting this is where the 'nonform' CSS class would be effectively applied or manipulated. These spans collectively offer a comprehensive view of FormSet error handling, making them suitable for implementing the proposed CSS class.",
