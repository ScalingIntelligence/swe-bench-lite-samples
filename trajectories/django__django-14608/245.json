Specifically, the `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py` and the `InlineAdminFormSet` class in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` are crucial for managing form errors in FormSets. The `non_form_errors` method in `BaseFormSet` and the `non_form_errors` property in `InlineAdminFormSet` are particularly relevant as they deal directly with non form errors. These spans of code are likely places where the `nonform` CSS class can be integrated to address the reported issue.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
