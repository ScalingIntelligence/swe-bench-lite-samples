This would distinguish non form errors in FormSets from form field errors and non field errors within forms. The search results provided cover the `BaseFormSet` class in Django's forms module, which is directly related to handling FormSets. Specifically, the `non_form_errors` method and the overall structure of how errors are managed and reported in `BaseFormSet` are relevant. These are the areas where the `nonform` CSS class could be integrated to meet the reported issue's requirements. Additionally, the `full_clean` method is crucial as it processes all errors, including those that would be marked with the `nonform` class. Therefore, these sections of code are identified as relevant to address the issue.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
