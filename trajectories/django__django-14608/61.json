This involves identifying the relevant parts of the codebase where FormSets handle errors and need modification to include this new CSS class. The relevant files from the Django source code that are likely to require changes are `django/forms/formsets.py`, `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`, and `django/forms/models.py`. Specifically, looking into methods like `non_form_errors` in `BaseFormSet` and similar error handling methods in other involved classes will be crucial for implementing this change.",

This would be similar to the 'nonfield' class used for non-field errors in standard Forms. The task involves identifying the relevant code spans where FormSet non-form errors are handled and where this new CSS class can be implemented. I would start looking at django/forms/formsets.py since this file contains the BaseFormSet class which is pertinent to FormSets and where handling of non-form errors likely occurs. Specifically, I'd focus on the non_form_errors method within BaseFormSet as it deals directly with non-form errors, making it a logical choice for integrating or modifying to include the new CSS class. Moving on to the contrib module (django/contrib/admin/helpers.py), it's noted that InlineAdminFormSet also involves a non_form_errors property which suggests it might also need adjustments to accommodate the issue's requirements. Therefore, relevant spans I've identified which will need implementation or modification are the non_form_errors method in django/forms/formsets.py and possibly in InlineAdminFormSet class in django/contrib/admin/helpers.py.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
