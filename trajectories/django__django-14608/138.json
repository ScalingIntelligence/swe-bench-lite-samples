From the search results, the `django/forms/formsets.py` file contains the relevant code related to FormSets, specifically the `BaseFormSet` class. This class manages formsets and contains methods for handling errors, such as `non_form_errors`. The suggested addition of the `nonform` CSS class should be implemented in the error handling section of this class. Currently, the `BaseFormSet` class uses `_non_form_errors` to manage these errors, but it doesn't apply any specific CSS class to them. Therefore, the relevant code span to modify is the `non_form_errors` method in the `BaseFormSet` class. Additionally, the `BaseForm` class in `django/forms/forms.py` shows how non-field errors are handled with a specific CSS class (`nonfield`), which provides a reference for how to implement a similar approach for non-form errors in `BaseFormSet`. The `AdminForm` class in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` is also relevant as it interacts with forms in an admin context, but since it primarily deals with non-field errors, it doesn't directly address the issue with non-form errors in FormSets. Therefore, the focus should be on enhancing the `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py`.",
