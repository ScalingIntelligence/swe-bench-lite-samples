Considering the context provided and the search results, the relevant parts of the code are primarily found in `django/forms/formsets.py` and `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`.  \n\nIn `django/forms/formsets.py`, the `BaseFormSet` class includes methods that handle errors, such as `non_form_errors` and `full_clean`, which are critical in identifying where and how error handling can be modified to include the new `nonform` CSS class. Additionally, `ManagementForm` handles crucial form management which could also be impacted by the proposed changes.  \n\nIn `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`, `InlineAdminFormSet` is directly related to how forms are handled in the admin interface and its `non_form_errors` property could be affected by the introduction of a new CSS class. This part of the codebase is relevant because users and developers likely interact with formsets in the admin UI, and any errors displayed here would benefit from this new classification.\n\nThe `BaseModelFormSet` in `django/forms/models.py` seems less directly relevant as it focuses more on model-related operations, which, while important, don't directly handle the error types specified in the issue. However, if there are any non-form errors related to model data in formsets, this could be a future consideration when implementing broader changes.\n\nGiven the specific nature of the issue, the main focus should remain with the basic formsets (`BaseFormSet`) and admin helpers (`InlineAdminFormSet`). Therefore, the identified spans in `django/forms/formsets.py` and `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` are crucial for directly addressing the requirement.\n",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
