The search results include several relevant sections of code from `django/forms/formsets.py`. Specifically, the `BaseFormSet` class and its methods provide context for handling form errors and formsets. The `non_form_errors` method in the `BaseFormSet` class seems most relevant, as it currently deals with non-form errors but does not yet apply the proposed `nonform` CSS class. The `__init__` method also contains relevant context for initializing formsets and handling errors.

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
