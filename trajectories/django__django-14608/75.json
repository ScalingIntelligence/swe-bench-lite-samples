The search results focus on the `BaseFormSet` class in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file, which is relevant as it contains the core functionality for handling formsets. The spans identified as most relevant include the initialization of `BaseFormSet`, the method for handling non-form errors (`non_form_errors`), and the overall cleaning process in `full_clean`. These sections are crucial for understanding how FormSets handle errors and where a new CSS class like `nonform` could be integrated. Additionally, the `BaseFormSet.__init__` span is important as it sets up the formset with initial data and error classes, which would potentially need updating to include new CSS classes for error differentiation. The `BaseFormSet.clean` span is also relevant as it is a hook for adding custom validation logic, which may need adjustments to support the new `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors.",

Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
