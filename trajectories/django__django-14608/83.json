It suggests that this class should be documented and used by developers to distinguish between form field errors, non field errors (forms), and non form errors (FormSets). Relevant files and methods seem to be located in the `django/forms` and `django/contrib/admin` directories, particularly focusing on the `BaseFormSet` and its related classes like `AdminForm`, `AdminErrorList`, `BaseModelFormSet`, and `BaseInlineFormSet`. The primary methods of interest are `non_form_errors` in `BaseFormSet` and related classes, and likely the rendering or error handling logic within these classes. The search should focus on these methods and classes to identify where the `nonform` CSS class might be added or how it can be implemented.",

These areas currently lack the `nonform` CSS class but are crucial for implementing and documenting this new feature.\n\nTwo specific spans of code in `django/forms/formsets.py` and `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` should be marked as relevant: the `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors` method and the `InlineAdminFormSet.non_form_errors` property.
