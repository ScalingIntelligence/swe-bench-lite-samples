The search results provided from `django/forms/formsets.py` contain several relevant code spans that pertain to form errors and formset functionality. Specifically: \n\n1. The `BaseFormSet` class is central to the functionality of formsets and includes methods like `__init__`, `non_form_errors`, and `_should_delete_form`. These methods are relevant because they deal with form errors at the formset level, which is directly related to the desired feature of adding a `nonform` CSS class. \n\n2. The `formset_factory` function is responsible for creating formsets and setting their properties such as `max_num` and `min_num`, which suggest it is involved in the overall error handling and validation, potentially making it a good candidate for implementing the new `nonform` CSS class. \n\nGiven the nature of the change requested, it is reasonable to focus on the `BaseFormSet` class because it handles the form errors categorization and storage (as can be seen in the `non_form_errors` method). Therefore, these code spans are relevant for making the modifications required to add the `nonform` CSS class.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
