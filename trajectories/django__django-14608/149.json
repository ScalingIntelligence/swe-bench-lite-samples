The issue suggests adding a CSS class similar to `nonfield` in Forms but for FormSets to distinguish non-form errors. The relevant part to focus on is where FormSets handle errors, particularly the `BaseFormSet` class. I identified the `non_form_errors` method within `BaseFormSet` as the likely spot to add the new CSS class. Additionally, the `BaseForm` class in `forms.py` provides context on how `nonfield` errors are handled, which informs how the `nonform` class should be integrated similarly. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans include the `non_form_errors` method in `BaseFormSet`, as it is directly related to handling errors in FormSets, and serves as the entry point for applying the new CSS class.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
