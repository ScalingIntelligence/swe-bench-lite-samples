            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue suggests adding a `nonform` CSS class for non form errors in FormSets to distinguish them from form field errors and non field errors within forms. This would be implemented in a custom ErrorList to differentiate error types when rendering error messages. Here are my thoughts on identifying relevant code: \n\n1. **FormSet Initialization and Error Handling**: The `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py` contains several key methods that handle form errors and validation, including `__init__`, `non_form_errors`, `errors`, `is_valid`, and `full_clean`. These methods manage the error classes and types of errors within FormSets. Therefore, these methods are relevant for understanding how non form errors are managed currently and where the `nonform` CSS class might be added. \n\n2. **Custom ErrorList Class**: The `AdminErrorList` class in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` shows an example of a custom ErrorList class that extends the default ErrorList to handle errors differently (potentially for admin interfaces). However, this class currently does not appear to be directly related to FormSets. Still, it is relevant for understanding how ErrorList can be extended and could potentially be adapted for FormSets to include the `nonform` class. \n\n3. **Specific Code Spans for Modification**: Sections within `BaseFormSet` that handle errors, such as `non_form_errors` and `full_clean`, are directly relevant because they are critical in managing and displaying errors in FormSets. These are the areas where the addition of the `nonform` CSS class would be most meaningful. \n\nBased on these observations, the identified spans in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file are crucial for modifying FormSets to include the new `nonform` CSS class for non form errors.",

This will help in distinguishing between form field errors, non-field errors (in forms), and non-form errors (in FormSets) when rendering error messages. \n\nThe current file context already provides good insights into `BaseFormSet` and its related methods such as `non_form_errors` and `errors`, which are directly relevant to this issue as they deal with error handling in FormSets. \n\nThe new search results introduce `AdminErrorList` in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`, which extends `forms.utils.ErrorList`. This class handles error lists in the admin interface and provides a method to include errors from both the main form and inline formsets. This is also relevant to the issue as it involves the handling and rendering of errors in a form-related context. \n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified in the `AdminErrorList` class and the `BaseFormSet` class, specifically around methods handling errors. These include `AdminErrorList.__init__` for handling errors in the admin context and `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors` and `BaseFormSet.errors` for the handling of non-form errors and all errors in FormSets respectively.",

This is documented in a section on \u200brendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.\n"
