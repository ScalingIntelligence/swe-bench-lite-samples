This issue is related to the `autodoc` extension, which is responsible for importing and documenting objects from Python modules. The search results provided include relevant code spans within the `autodoc` extension, particularly in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` files. Key spans include the `Documenter` class and its methods, such as `filter_members`, which is responsible for determining which members to document. The code spans also include functions like `members_option` and `get_object_members`, which handle the parsing of member options and the retrieval of object members, respectively. These components are central to the functionality described in the issue and are likely to be part of the solution or the area needing adjustment to resolve the problem.",
