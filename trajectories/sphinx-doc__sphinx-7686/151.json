To address this, it's crucial to focus on the code responsible for filtering and determining which members to include in the documentation, especially in the context of imported members. The search results provide several crucial functions and methods within the `Documenter` class, particularly `filter_members`. This method is responsible for filtering members based on various criteria, including whether they are private, documented, or special members. Specifically, the filtering logic involves checking attributes of the members and applying options like 'undoc_members' and 'private_members'. In the context of the issue, it seems relevant to review how imported members are treated and ensure they are excluded when the appropriate configuration is set (i.e., 'autosummary_imported_members' is False). The provided code spans include the necessary logic for filtering members, which is relevant to solving the reported issue.",
