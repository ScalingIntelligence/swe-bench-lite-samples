This issue highlights the necessity to review how members are processed and filtered within the Sphinx autodoc extension to ensure that imported members are excluded appropriately based on the setting.\n\nIn the analysis of the provided search results, several key spans stand out as highly relevant to resolving this issue:\n1. 'Documenter.get_object_members': This method is directly responsible for retrieving the members of an object. It should be examined to ensure that imported members are not included if the 'autosummary_imported_members' setting is False.\n2. 'ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members': As an extension of 'Documenter', this method focuses specifically on module members and should also be checked for how it processes and filters members.\n3. 'Documenter.filter_members': This method is pivotal as it filters the members list to include only those that should be documented. This process needs to be scrutinized to ensure that imported members are excluded as per the configuration.\n4. 'ModuleDocumenter' initializer and its option specification can influence how members are interpreted and should be considered in tweaking the behavior to align with the desired configuration.\n5. The 'import_object' function in 'importer.py' is foundational as it handles the importing of objects, and understanding its mechanics can help in tracing how imported members might mistakenly end up in the members list.\n\nThese spans form a crucial part of understanding and rectifying how the autosummary handles member documentation, ensuring that the inclusion of imported members can be controlled accurately via the 'autosummary_imported_members' directive.",

The relevant parts of the code include the `__init__` method of `ModuleDocumenter`, which merges special members options, and potentially the `get_object_members` method, which retrieves the members of the module. Additionally, the `setup` function is relevant as it initializes the extension and registers the `ModuleDocumenter`.

Specifically, the method uses `safe_getattr` to check if members are part of the module, but there doesn't appear to be any explicit check for whether a member is imported. Therefore, the logic might not be correctly filtering out imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to False. Also, the `get_object_members` method of the `ModuleDocumenter` class, which gathers members to filter, does not seem to differentiate between directly defined and imported members in the case of wanting all members when `autosummary_imported_members` is False.",
