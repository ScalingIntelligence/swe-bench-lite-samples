If `want_all` is True and the module has `__all__` defined, it uses the members listed in `__all__`. This method should be reviewed to ensure it does not include imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is False. The `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` is also relevant as it collects all members of an object, which could potentially include imported members.
