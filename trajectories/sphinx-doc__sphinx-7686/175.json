This suggests that the core issue lies in the logic that determines which members to include in the documentation, particularly in the contexts of module, class, and attribute documentation. The search results reveal several relevant code spans, including methods for importing objects, filtering members, and getting object members. These methods are crucial for determining what members are included in the documentation. The relevant spans include 'Documenter.import_object', 'Documenter.get_object_members', 'Documenter.filter_members', 'ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members', and the helper functions 'import_object' and 'get_object_members'. These spans collectively handle the import and determination of members to be documented, and thus are directly related to the reported issue. The issue suggests that imported members are not being correctly excluded when 'autosummary_imported_members' is False, which would be addressed by examining and potentially modifying these code spans.",

This requires examining how members are collected and filtered. We need to focus on the `get_object_members` and `filter_members` methods, particularly in the `ModuleDocumenter` class in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. These methods are responsible for gathering and filtering members of the module. The current context provides these methods in the `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` classes, but it's essential to check if the logic around handling the `imported_members` option aligns with the configuration.\n\nIn the new search results, we find the `get_object_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py`, which collects members of an object. Similarly, the `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class is used to filter these members based on various criteria. The `ModuleDocumenter` class, which extends `Documenter`, also has a `get_object_members` method specific to modules. These methods should be examined closely to ensure they correctly respect the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration.\n\nGiven the alignment of the new search results with the reported issue, I will identify the relevant code spans from the search results for further analysis and ensure the search task can be considered complete based on the provided context and results.",

        "message": "The search returned 8 results. But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue concerns the inclusion of imported members in the `members` variable for the module template, even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`. The steps to identify relevant code spans are as follows:\n\n1. **Understand the Issue**: The issue is about ensuring that the `members` variable in the module template does not include imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is `False`.\n2. **Review File Context**: The provided file context includes spans from `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py`. These spans involve methods like `merge_special_members_option`, `Documenter.get_object_members`, `Documenter.filter_members`, and `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`, which are relevant to controlling the inclusion of members.\n3. **Analyze Search Results**: The search results also contain spans from `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py`. Relevant spans include `Documenter.get_object_members` and `Documenter.filter_members`, which determine which members to include and filter them based on various criteria, such as whether they are imported members.\n4. **Identify Relevant Spans**: Spans that define the behavior of member inclusion and filtering, such as `Documenter.get_object_members` and `Documenter.filter_members`, are crucial. These methods control which members are included in the documentation and how they are filtered based on options like `autosummary_imported_members`.\n\nGiven the focus on controlling member inclusion and filtering, the identified spans from both the file context and the search results are relevant to address the reported issue. However, the search results do not introduce new relevant code spans that were not already identified in the file context.",
