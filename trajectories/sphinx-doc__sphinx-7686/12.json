The issue highlights that the 'members' variable contains imported members even when the 'autosummary_imported_members' configuration is set to False. To address this, we need to identify the parts of the code responsible for determining and filtering members. From the provided search results, several key parts of the code are relevant:\n\n1. **Documenter.get_object_members**: This method retrieves members of the object and filters them based on whether all members are wanted or specific members are mentioned.\n\n2. **Documenter.filter_members**: This method further filters members based on specific conditions such as documentation presence, privacy, and inherited status.\n\n3. **ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members**: This method specializes in retrieving members for modules, distinguishing between implicit and explicit module members and handling the '__all__' attribute.\n\nCombining these insights, it's clear that the methods responsible for determining the members to be documented, and subsequently filtering them, are likely where the adjustment needs to occur to respect the 'autosummary_imported_members' configuration. Specifically, the 'filter_members' method, in conjunction with 'get_object_members', should evaluate the 'autosummary_imported_members' option to exclude or include imported members.\n\nThese code spans should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure they correctly filter out imported members when 'autosummary_imported_members' is set to False.",

The 'autosummary' extension likely interacts with the 'autodoc' extension to determine which members to include in the documentation. The 'autodoc' extension seems to handle object member retrieval and filtering, as evidenced by the 'get_object_members' and 'filter_members' methods in the 'ModuleDocumenter' class within the 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' file. Specifically, the 'autosummary_imported_members' flag should influence the behavior of these methods to exclude imported members when set to False.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the `members` variable in the module template including imported members even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to False. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle the generation of members and the filtering of imported members. The task is to ensure that when `autosummary_imported_members` is False, the `members` variable should not include imported members.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, the focus should be on the `Documenter` class and its subclasses, particularly the `ModuleDocumenter`. The `get_object_members` method in both `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` seems crucial as it is responsible for gathering the members of an object. Additionally, the `filter_members` method in `Documenter` is important as it filters the members based on various conditions, including whether they are private or inherited.\n\nLooking at the search results, the `merge_special_members_option` function and the `get_object_members` methods in both `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` are particularly relevant. The `merge_special_members_option` function deals with the handling of special members and how they are merged with the general members list. The `get_object_members` methods gather members based on whether they are explicitly defined or inherited, and this is where the filter for imported members might need adjustment.\n\nThe `get_object_members` method in `ModuleDocumenter` is especially relevant as it specifically handles the members for modules. The behavior around how imported members are treated should be scrutinized here. Also, the `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` is responsible for gathering the members of an object, which includes imported members. The logic that distinguishes between locally defined members and imported ones should be reviewed to ensure that when `autosummary_imported_members` is False, imported members are not included.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans of code are critical for addressing the issue. The spans related to `merge_special_members_option`, `get_object_members` in both `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter`, and the `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` should be carefully reviewed and possibly adjusted to ensure that imported members are excluded when the `autosummary_imported_members` option is set to False.",
