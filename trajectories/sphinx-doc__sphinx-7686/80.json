The relevant code spans should involve the logic where members are gathered and filtered based on the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration. The search results provide several key spans that are relevant to this issue. In `ModuleDocumenter`, the `__init__` method calls `merge_special_members_option`, which manipulates the `members` option. Additionally, `ModuleDocumenter`'s `get_object_members` method is responsible for fetching the actual members of the module, which should respect the `autosummary_imported_members` flag. These methods and classes are directly related to the collection and filtering of module members, making them essential for addressing the reported issue. Furthermore, understanding how `import_module` and `import_object` in `importer.py` handle the import process can also provide context on how modules and their members are loaded, potentially influencing the process that gathers these members.",
