It appears that imported members are still being included in the `members` list despite this setting. To address this, we need to identify the relevant sections of the code that handle the filtering of members and ensure that imported members are excluded when `autosummary_imported_members` is False.\n\nFrom the search results, several code spans appear relevant:\n1. The `Documenter.filter_members` method is responsible for filtering members based on various criteria, including whether they are private, undocumented, or special methods. This method should be inspected to ensure it respects the `autosummary_imported_members` setting.\n2. The `members_option` and `inherited_members_option` functions in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` handle the parsing of the `members` and `inherited-members` options, respectively. Understanding how these options are processed and passed to the `filter_members` method will be crucial.\n3. The `ClassDocumenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` classes both call `merge_special_members_option` during initialization, indicating they handle member options and may influence the inclusion of members in the documentation.\n4. The `AutodocDirective` class in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py` is where the directive options are parsed and passed to the Documenter classes. This is where the initial configuration for `autosummary_imported_members` might be set.\n\nGiven these points, the identified code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue with imported members being included in the autosummary template when `autosummary_imported_members` is False.",

Notably, there are specific methods within the `ModuleDocumenter` class, such as `__init__`, `can_document_member`, `resolve_name`, `parse_name`, `add_directive_header`, and `get_object_members`. These methods are responsible for the actual processing and documentation of modules, which directly involves handling the members listed in the documentation.\n\nKey matches from the search results include the `ModuleDocumenter` class, which has methods that control how members are displayed and filtered.
