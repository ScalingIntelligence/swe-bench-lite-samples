This indicates a problem with the filtering mechanism that determines which members are included in the documentation. I examined the provided code spans from the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` files.\n\nFirst, I looked at the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` and `Documenter.get_object_members` methods. These methods construct the list of members to be documented. The `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method is especially relevant because it handles the module-level members. The logic that checks `want_all` and the presence of `__all__` in the module's attributes could potentially affect whether imported members are included. This method should be checked to ensure it respects the `autosummary_imported_members` flag.\n\nNext, I examined `Documenter.filter_members`, which filters the members based on various options including `undoc_members`, `special_members`, and `private_members`. This method also uses `self.options.inherited_members`, which might intersect with the issue of imported members inclusion. This method could be where the bug lies, particularly in how it processes members from inherited classes or imported modules.\n\nLastly, I looked at `get_object_members` in the `importer.py` file, which provides a comprehensive list of members from a given object. Since this function is used to gather members before filtering, it could be the source of including imported members unintentionally.\n\nBased on this analysis, I identified the relevant spans in both files that are crucial to understanding and potentially fixing the issue with imported members inclusion in autosummary.\n\n",
