This suggests an issue with how the `members` variable is being populated or filtered in the `autosummary` extension or related modules. To address this, we should focus on the `autosummary` and `autodoc` extensions, specifically looking for the logic that determines which members to include in the documentation. The `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` classes in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and the `import_object` and `get_object_members` functions in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` are likely key points of interest.

This requires reviewing how members are retrieved and filtered in the Sphinx autodoc extension. In the provided context, there are two files that are relevant: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py`. These files contain methods and functions that handle the retrieval and filtering of object members. The `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` retrieves members of an object, while the `Documenter` class and its methods in `__init__.py` manage how these members are documented and filtered. The new search results confirm the presence of these functions and classes, which is in line with what was found in the initial context. Notably, the `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class contains logic for deciding which members to keep based on the `special-members`, `members`, and `undoc-members` options among others. This method is crucial for understanding how imported members might be included even when they shouldn't be. Given all these pieces of context and the formulations from the search results, it appears there is a consistent pattern of code that aligns with investigating the issue of imported members being included when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to False. The presence of the `get_object_members` function and the filtering logic in `Documenter` suggests that further investigation into how these specific parts of the codebase handle the configuration settings related to including imported members is warranted.",

The `Documenter.get_object_members` and `Documenter.filter_members` methods also play crucial roles in determining which members are included. Additionally, the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its `get_object_members` method are relevant as they deal with module-level members.
