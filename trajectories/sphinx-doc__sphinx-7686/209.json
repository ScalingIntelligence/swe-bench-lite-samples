The key to resolving this issue lies in the `Documenter` class, specifically the `get_object_members` method, which is responsible for fetching the members of an object. The `filter_members` method is also relevant as it filters these members based on various options, including `autosummary_imported_members`. Furthermore, the `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` is crucial as it defines how the members are retrieved from the object.\n\nFrom the search results, the `Documenter` class and its methods provide a detailed insight into how members are fetched and filtered. The `ModuleDocumenter` class, which inherits from `Documenter`, specifically handles modules and their members. The `get_object_members` method in `ModuleDocumenter` also includes logic for handling the `__all__` attribute, which should help in filtering out unwanted members.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans identified revolve around the `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` classes, particularly the `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, and the corresponding methods in `ModuleDocumenter`, as well as the `get_object_members` function in `importer.py`. These sections of the codebase need to be carefully examined and potentially modified to ensure that imported members are not included when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to False.",
