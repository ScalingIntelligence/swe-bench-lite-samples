This suggests a potential problem with how the 'get_object_members' method is handling the inclusion of imported members. Upon reviewing the code in the context provided and the new search results, it is evident that the 'ModuleDocumenter' class and its 'get_object_members' method are central to addressing this issue. The existing implementation of 'get_object_members' in 'ModuleDocumenter' does not explicitly filter out imported members when the 'imported-members' option is set to False, which could explain the bug. This lack of filtering is likely the cause of the unwanted inclusion of imported members in the 'members' variable. To fix this issue, the 'get_object_members' method needs to be adjusted to correctly apply the 'imported-members' option, ensuring that only non-imported members are included when the option is set to False. The identified code spans are relevant as they encapsulate the method in question and its context, including the parent class's handling of similar functionality.",
