This suggests a need to investigate how the `members` variable is being populated and filtered in the context of the autosummary extension. The relevant code is likely in the `autodoc` extension since `autosummary` is typically built around `autodoc` for generating documentation. The key classes to look into are `ModuleDocumenter` and `Documenter`, as they handle the documentation of modules and their members. Additionally, the `import_object` method and the `filter_members` method are critical as they handle the importing and filtering of members respectively.",

By examining the provided search results, I identified the 'filter_members' method in the 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' file. This method is critical for filtering and processing members to decide which ones to include in the documentation. It includes checks for private members, special methods, and whether members have documentation. The logic within this method should be inspected to ensure that it properly respects the 'autosummary_imported_members' configuration. Given this, the 'filter_members' method appears to be directly relevant to solving the reported issue.
