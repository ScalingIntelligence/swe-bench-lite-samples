This suggests that the bug might be in the logic that populates the 'members' variable or in the configuration handling.

Relevant files might include those involved in the autosummary extension, such as those handling module documentation, object import, and member filtering.

Particularly relevant are the `get_object_members` method in `ModuleDocumenter` and the `filter_members` and `document_members` methods in the `Documenter` class.

            "scratch_pad": "Given the additional context, the issue with 'members' including imported members when 'autosummary_imported_members' is set to False is likely related to how the configuration options are handled and how members are filtered within the autosummary extension. The provided files, particularly 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' and 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py', contain functions and classes that handle the member filtering and configuration options. To further investigate, we should look at the part of the code where members are filtered based on the 'autosummary_imported_members' configuration. Additionally, we should check if the configuration option is correctly applied during the member filtering process.",
