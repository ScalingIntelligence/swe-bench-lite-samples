To address this, we need to identify the code responsible for determining which members to include in the documentation. From the search results, several key functions and classes are relevant:\n\n1. The `Documenter` class and its method `get_object_members` are crucial for fetching members of an object. It is used to determine which members to include in the documentation and can filter based on options like `want_all`.\n\n2. The `ModuleDocumenter` class inherits from `Documenter` and specializes in documenting modules. Its `get_object_members` method is especially relevant because it handles fetching members specifically for modules.\n\n3. The `ClassDocumenter` class also inherits from `Documenter` and focuses on documenting classes. Its implementation of `get_object_members` is relevant for understanding how members of classes are handled.\n\n4. The `import_object` function in `importer.py` is responsible for importing objects from modules. This is significant because it sets the stage for determining which members to document.\n\n5. The `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` is also relevant as it retrieves members of a given object, including cases where these members might be imported. This function is essential for understanding how imported members are considered.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, we can identify how the `members` variable is populated and how we can ensure that it does not include imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to False. This includes understanding the logic that decides whether to include inherited or imported members based on configuration settings.",

The current context already covers some relevant code spans, particularly those in the ModuleDocumenter class and the merge_special_members_option function. The new search results provide additional insights into the ModuleDocumenter class, specifically the filter_members method which helps in filtering out unwanted members based on various conditions. This method can be crucial in ensuring that only relevant members (not imported ones when the option is set to False) are included. Additionally, the get_object_members function in the importer.py file facilitates the retrieval of members from the module, which could be instrumental in deciding whether to include imported members based on the configuration settings. Therefore, these additional code spans should address the reported issue, providing a comprehensive insight into how members are managed within the context of the Sphinx autodoc extension.",

Specifically, the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its methods `__init__` and `get_object_members` are key as they handle the options and retrieval of module members. Additionally, the `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class is also relevant as it filters members based on options, including the handling of imported members.

The `filter_members` method plays a key role in deciding which members to include, basing this decision on configuration options such as `autosummary_imported_members`. Despite the complexity and depth of the autodoc extension, critical segments such as `get_object_members` and `filter_members` that are likely related to excluding imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is False are present.
