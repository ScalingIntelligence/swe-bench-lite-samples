This issue can be traced to the `get_object_members` method within the Documenter class. This method should respect the configuration option `autosummary_imported_members` and filter out imported members accordingly. Upon examining the relevant code spans, notably the `Documenter.get_object_members` method, it becomes evident that the method needs to be adjusted to ensure it filters imported members based on the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration setting. This requires a modification to the logic within the `get_object_members` method to explicitly check the configuration and act accordingly. The existing methods `members_option`, `members_set_option`, and `inherited_members_option` might be adjusted or used to influence sorting and selecting members.\n\nAdditionally, related classes like `ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter` might also need to be inspected to ensure consistency in how members are handled across different documenters. The `filter_members` method within the Documenter class is also critical as it is responsible for deciding which members to include in the documentation based on various criteria including the docstring content and options like `undoc_members`. Ensuring that the logic in these methods respects the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration setting would resolve the reported issue.",
