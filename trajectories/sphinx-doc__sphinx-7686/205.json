The method checks whether a member should be kept by considering if it's documented, private, and matches the criteria set by user options and settings. This includes handling options for special, private, and undocumented members, amongst others. Setting `autosummary_imported_members` to `False` should essentially bypass including imported members, but there appears to be a discrepancy as indicated in the issue. To pinpoint and correct this, further inspection of how `autosummary_imported_members` is parsed and applied, particularly within the `autosummary` extension's `__init__.py`, is crucial. The `Config` class in `sphinx/config.py` shows how configuration values are handled and applied across the Sphinx framework, but how `autosummary_imported_members` specifically interacts with the `autodoc` or `autosummary` processes isn't fully revealed here.
