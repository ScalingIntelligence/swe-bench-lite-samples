I examined the provided code spans and focused on the `get_object_members` methods within the `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` classes, as these are responsible for determining which members to include. Specifically, the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method seems most relevant because it handles the inclusion of module members and can control whether imported members are included. The method checks for the `ignore_module_all` and `__all__` attributes to decide which members to include. This logic should be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure that when `autosummary_imported_members` is False, imported members are excluded from the `members` list provided to the template.",

To address this, I need to identify where the `members` variable is being populated and ensure that it does not include imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is `False`. From the provided contexts and search results, it's evident that the `members` variable is primarily managed in the `get_object_members` methods of `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` classes. These methods determine which members to include and how to filter them based on various options like `inherited_members` and `imported_members`. The `ModuleDocumenter` class is especially important as it has specific handling for module-level members. Additionally, the `merge_special_members_option` should be reviewed to ensure it does not inadvertently include imported members. Given this, the relevant spans would be those covering the `get_object_members` methods in both `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter`, the `__init__` method in `ModuleDocumenter` to see how options are initialized, and additionally, the `merge_special_members_option` function to ensure it's not contributing to the issue.",

Specifically, I should look for functions or methods that determine the content of the 'members' variable and ensure they respect the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration. From the file context, it's clear that the `ModuleDocumenter` class in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` has methods that handle module-level members and their retrieval. The method `get_object_members` in the `Documenter` class and its overridden version in `ModuleDocumenter` seem particularly relevant as they involve decisions on which members to include. Additionally, the `get_object_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` is responsible for fetching members of an object, which could also be implicated in including imported members when not intended. The new search results mostly reinforce this understanding, with confirmation that `ModuleDocumenter` and `Documenter` classes handle member filtering and inclusion, and that `autosummary_imported_members` influences which members are considered valid for documentation. The search task can be considered complete as the crucial parts of the codebase have been identified.",
