But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue indicates that the `members` variable in the module template includes imported members even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to False. This suggests that there might be a flaw in how the `ModuleDocumenter` class handles the inclusion of members.\n\nThe provided context already includes the `ModuleDocumenter` class with its `get_object_members` method, where the logic for deciding which members to include seems to be implemented. Analyzing this method, it appears that it should respect the `autosummary_imported_members` option when determining which members to include. However, the issue persists, indicating a potential oversight or bug in this logic.\n\nNew search results reveal the `Documenter` class and specifically the `filter_members` method. This method involves filtering members based on various criteria, including the `undoc_members` option. However, the logic does not explicitly address the `imported_members` option.
