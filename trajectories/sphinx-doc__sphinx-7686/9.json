The `Documenter.get_object_members` and `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` methods are directly relevant as they manage the retrieval and filtering of members for documentation. The `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` is also crucial as it provides the mechanism for obtaining the members of an object, potentially including imported ones, which is the core issue at hand. By examining these specific areas, we can gain insight into how the inclusion of imported members is currently handled and where adjustments may be needed to align with the desired behavior. Overall, the identified code spans are pertinent to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",

Specifically, `ModuleDocumenter` class in `__init__.py` handles the option for `imported-members` and deals with the retrieval of members. The `get_object_members` method in the same class is crucial for filtering members based on various options, including `autosummary_imported_members`. The `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` is also relevant as it retrieves members of an object, which could include imported members.
