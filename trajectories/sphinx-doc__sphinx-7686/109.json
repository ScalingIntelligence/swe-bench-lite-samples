            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the `members` variable in the `autosummary` module template, which includes imported members even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to False. To address this, we need to identify the code responsible for determining which members to include in the `members` list. The search results provide several key sections in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file that handle member filtering and processing. The `Documenter.get_object_members` and `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` methods are particularly relevant, as they control which members are included based on the `want_all` flag and other options like `autosummary_imported_members`. Additionally, the `get_object_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` is responsible for gathering all possible members, which is then filtered by the aforementioned methods. These sections of code are critical for understanding how members are included and could be modified to respect the `autosummary_imported_members` setting.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need to ensure that the solution respects the `autosummary_imported_members` flag and does not unintentionally filter or include other members, a detailed review and potential modification of the `get_object_members` method and related filtering logic in the `Documenter` class would be necessary. The current implementation does not explicitly check the `autosummary_imported_members` flag but instead filters based on the `want_all` flag and options like `undoc_members`. To address the bug, a check for the `autosummary_imported_members` flag should be integrated into the member filtering logic.",
