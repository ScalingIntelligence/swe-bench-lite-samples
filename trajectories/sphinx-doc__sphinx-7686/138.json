The search results reveal key methods and classes within the sphinx.ext.autodoc module that are relevant to this process. Specifically, the `Documenter.get_object_members` method and the `get_object_members` function in `ModuleDocumenter` need to be examined. These methods seem to control the inclusion of members, including imported ones, based on configuration options like `want_all` and `self.options.members`. The `Documenter.filter_members` method also plays a role in filtering members based on various criteria, which could include checking for imported members if configured. The `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` is responsible for gathering members of an object, which could include imported members depending on its implementation. These areas of code are critical for ensuring that the members variable does not include imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is False, aligning with the expected behavior described in the issue. Further investigation into these code spans is necessary to ensure they handle the imported members correctly based on the configuration settings.",

The `get_object_members` method within these classes appears central to this functionality, and there is an extensive filtering process in the `filter_members` method that aligns with the issue description. The related `get_object_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` also seems pertinent as it contributes to the identification and categorization of members. Given the depth of these methods and the context provided, it seems likely that resolving the issue would involve adjustments to these methods.
