The analysis of the search results reveals several key areas in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` that are relevant to this problem. These areas involve the handling and filtering of members, both in modules and objects. The `Documenter` class, for example, has methods for getting and filtering members, while the `get_object_members` function in the importer module deals with collecting these members from objects. Additionally, the `ModuleDocumenter` class is also of note, as it extends the `Documenter` and is specifically used for documenting modules. This suggests that these sections of code are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the issue related to imported members in autosummary.",
