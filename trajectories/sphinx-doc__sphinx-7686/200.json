To address this, we need to identify where the `members` list is generated and filtered in the `autosummary` extension and its dependencies. The relevant files and functions appear to be in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/` directory, particularly the `__init__.py` and `importer.py` files which handle module and object importing, and member filtering. We also need to check the `directive.py` file which might be involved in the template processing.",

The 'Documenter' class and its methods 'get_object_members' and 'get_real_modname'. These methods are responsible for gathering and filtering members of an object or module.\n2. The 'ModuleDocumenter' class, which inherits from 'Documenter' and specializes in documenting modules. Its 'get_object_members' method is particularly relevant as it handles the members of a module.\n3. The 'get_module_members' function in 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py', which collects members of a module.\n4. The 'document_members' method in 'Documenter', which processes and documents the members of an object or module.\n\nRelevant code spans from these areas will include:\n- The 'get_object_members' method in both 'Documenter' and 'ModuleDocumenter' classes.\n- The 'get_real_modname' method in 'Documenter'.\n- The 'get_module_members' function in 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py'.\n- The 'document_members' method in 'Documenter'.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, it should be possible to determine how the 'members' variable is populated and filtered, and thus address the issue of including imported members when 'autosummary_imported_members' is False.",

Specifically, the `get_object_members` method in these classes decides which members to document based on configuration settings such as `autosummary_imported_members`. The code analysis shows that this method filters members based on the `members` option in the `options` dictionary, which is populated from the configuration settings. However, the search results did not yield any direct mention or handling of `autosummary_imported_members`. This indicates that the root issue of filtering out imported members in `autosummary` might be deeper within the integration logic between `autodoc` and `autosummary` extensions, or within the template processing logic that interprets these settings.",
