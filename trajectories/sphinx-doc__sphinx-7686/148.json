This issue could be related to the logic in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module that handles the inclusion of members. Specifically, the `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class seems to be the primary place where members are filtered based on various criteria, including whether they are imported. Additionally, the `members_option` and `inherited_members_option` functions in the same file handle the processing of the `members` and `inherited_members` options, respectively. The `get_object_members` function in `sphinx.ext.autodoc.importer`, which retrieves the members of an object, could also be relevant as it gathers all members, potentially including imported ones. Given these code spans, they appear to be relevant to the reported issue, as they directly deal with the inclusion and exclusion of members based on configuration settings like `autosummary_imported_members`. Further inspection of how these functions interact and the conditions under which they include or exclude members would be necessary to confirm and potentially identify the root cause of the issue.",

This suggests that there is a bug in the logic that determines which members to include in the `members` variable. After reviewing the provided code and context, it's clear that the logic for filtering members is spread across several functions and methods, particularly in the `ModuleDocumenter` and `Documenter` classes. The `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class seems to be a critical part of this logic. Furthermore, the `members_option`, `inherited_members_option`, and `merge_special_members_option` functions also play a role in determining which members are included. The new search results confirm the presence of these functions and methods, and they are indeed relevant to the reported issue. The `get_object_members` function from the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` file is also relevant as it retrieves the members of an object, which could include imported members. Given this information, the relevant code spans have been identified as those that deal with the logic for filtering and determining which members to include.",
