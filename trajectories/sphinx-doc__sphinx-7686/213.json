This suggests that there might be a problem in how the `members` variable is being populated or filtered in the `autosummary` extension of Sphinx. Given the nature of the issue, I should focus my search on the `get_object_members` method and the `filter_members` method within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` files, as these methods are responsible for retrieving and filtering module members. Additionally, since the issue is related to the `autosummary` extension's template handling, I should also look for code related to template processing in the `sphinx/ext/autosummary/` directory.",

The `get_object_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` also plays a crucial role in retrieving object members, which would influence the behavior of the others.

However, the current implementation of `get_object_members` and `filter_members` doesn't explicitly handle the `autosummary_imported_members` option.

The issue specifies that even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`, the `members` variable still includes imported members. This indicates that the logic for filtering out imported members in the `get_object_members` or `filter_members` methods might be incorrect or not being applied correctly. The provided code spans show relevant methods and classes such as `Documenter`, `ModuleDocumenter`, and `get_object_members` which are central to the issue. Specifically, `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` and `Documenter.filter_members` are critical as they directly handle the retrieval and filtering of members. The `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` also plays a key role in gathering member information that could include imported members. By examining these spans, it's evident that the logic related to handling `members` and filtering them based on `options` like `imported_members` is spread across multiple functions and classes. For instance, `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` checks for `__all__` but does not explicitly filter based on `imported_members`. Similarly, `Documenter.filter_members` processes members but lacks a clear check for excluding imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is `False`.
