            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the `autosummary` extension in Sphinx, which includes imported members in the `members` variable even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`. To address this, it's necessary to identify the code responsible for determining which members are included in the generated documentation. The search results provide several key functions and classes: `Documenter.get_object_members`, `Documenter.filter_members`, and `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`, which are crucial for understanding how members are selected.\n\nThe `Documenter.get_object_members` function decides which members to include based on options like `autosummary_imported_members`. The `ModuleDocumenter` class, which inherits from `Documenter`, further customizes this behavior for modules, possibly introducing the bug by not respecting the `autosummary_imported_members` setting appropriately.\n\nMoreover, the `get_object_members` function in `importer.py` is part of the mechanism that collects all members of an object, potentially including imported ones. This function could be the starting point for the bug since it indiscriminately gathers members regardless of their origin.\n\nBoth `Documenter.get_object_members` and `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` need careful review to ensure they correctly handle the `autosummary_imported_members` option. The inclusion of imported members in the `members` list is likely happening here due to inadequate filtering based on this setting. Given these insights, the identified spans are relevant to the issue and should be further examined or modified to resolve the bug.",
