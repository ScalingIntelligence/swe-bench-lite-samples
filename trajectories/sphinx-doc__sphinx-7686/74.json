The expected behavior is that the `members` variable in the module template should not include imported members. To address this, we need to focus on the code responsible for determining which members to include. The relevant code spans are within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file, specifically the `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class, which processes and filters members based on various options including `autosummary_imported_members`. Additionally, the `get_object_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` is responsible for retrieving members of an object, which is a critical part of the filtering process. Both of these code spans are essential to understand and potentially modify to fix the issue with imported members.",

Analyzed the reported issue which focuses on the 'members' variable for the autosummary module template incorrectly including imported members even when 'autosummary_imported_members' is set to False. This is problematic because it doesn't align with the expected behavior as defined by the 'autosummary_imported_members' configuration option.\n\n2. Reviewed the current file context which includes some relevant files like 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' that deal with the logic for filtering members based on options like 'autosummary_imported_members'. These files contain specific code segments for handling member options and filtering members.\n\n3. Processed new search results. Focused on identifying code spans that manage options like 'imported-members' and the logic that filters or includes members in the output. Found several relevant code spans. For example, in 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py', found the 'ModuleDocumenter' class that includes an option specification for 'imported-members' and 'members'. Additionally, found the 'get_object_members' method in 'Documenter' which is crucial for fetching and filtering members. In 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py', the 'get_object_members' function is also relevant for this issue as it fetches attributes and determines whether they are imported or not. These spans are directly related to managing and filtering members in the context of configuration options.\n\n4.
