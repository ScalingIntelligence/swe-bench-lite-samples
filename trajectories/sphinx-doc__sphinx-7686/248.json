This includes the 'get_object_members' and 'filter_members' methods, which are instrumental in determining the members included in the documentation. By focusing on these methods, we can identify how imported members are included and ensure they can be excluded based on the configuration.

Additionally, I will examine the `Autosummary` class and its related methods to ensure that the intended configuration options are respected during the generation of the documentation summary tables. This involves checking how the `autosummary_imported_members` option is integrated and whether it correctly affects the behavior of including imported members in the `members` list.
