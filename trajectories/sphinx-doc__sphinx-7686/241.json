From the search results, there are several relevant code spans that deal with the handling of members and imported members. Here's a breakdown of why each of these code spans is relevant:\n\n1. **IDENTITY: This function is simple and not directly relevant to this specific issue.**\n2. **IMPLEMENTATION (8): All constant and special object definitions don't seem directly relevant currently.**\n3. **MEMBER_OPTION: Deals with the parsing of the members option, which is directly related to the 'members' configuration in question.**\n4. **MEMBERS_SET_OPTION: Similar to MEMBER_OPTION, this function processes members to be set, which could influence which members are included.**\n5. **INHERITED_MEMBERS_OPTION: This function processes the inherited_members option, closely related to the issue as it deals with the handling of inherited members.**\n6. **IMPLEMENTATION (16): All special object definitions are not directly relevant to the current discussion.**\n7. **ANNOTATION_OPTION: This function sets options for annotations which are not directly related to members handling.**\n8. **BOOL_OPTION: A generic function that returns 'True', not directly relevant regarding the current issue.**\n9. **MERGE_SPECIAL_MEMBERS_OPTION: Modifies the options with special members, which might include/exclude members based on configurations.**\n10. **DOCUMENTER: It's a base class for documenting objects but without analyzing its specific methods, it's hard to fully assess relevance.**\n11. **DOCUMENTER.__INIT__: This initializes the Documenter class, laying the foundation for how members are considered or filtered.**\n12. **DOCUMENTER.FILTER_MEMBERS: This method filters members while documenting, potentially using options set previously by the parsed options. This method is crucial to how members are chosen or omitted based on configurations like 'autosummary_imported_members'.**\n13. **MODULEDOCUMENTER, CLASSDOCUMENTER: Both extend Documenter and it's likely these classes might change how the base class functions in context of actual module/class documentation.**\n\nThese spans offer comprehensive oversight of how member inclusions are handled through various options and functions. They show how options like 'members', 'inherited_members', and 'special-members' are processed and applied, suggesting direct relevance to the designed functionality hopefully leading to better understanding or resolve for the issue in question.\n\nAlso, looking into 'get_module_members' in importer.py seems relevant as it retrieves actual members of a module which is tightly linked to the issue of displaying incorrect members due to improper filtering of imported ones.\n\nGiven this analysis, the code spans associated with options handling, specifically filter_members and get_module_members, should be considered for any updates or corrections needed based on the reported issue.",

The autosummary extension likely relies on or extends the functionality of autodoc for processing members. Given the shared nature of these extensions, understanding how 'autosummary_imported_members' is handled in the context of autodoc might provide insights into where to correct the behavior in autosummary. The focus should shift to identifying the integration points or overrides where autosummary might be interacting with autodoc's member handling.",

This could imply that the filtering logic for members is not sufficiently inspecting or respecting the 'autosummary_imported_members' flag. To proceed, it would be beneficial to perform a deeper analysis of the autosummary mechanisms for generating documentation, specifically looking into the parsing and inclusion of module members. This may involve debugging and manual inspection of the behavior when the setting is toggled.",
