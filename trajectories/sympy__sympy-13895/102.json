The steps include importing symbols and expressions from the sympy library, defining an expression, and attempting to simplify it. The discrepancy is observed when substituting specific values, indicating an issue with the simplification logic or potential limitations in the sympy simplification routines. Given the complexity of the expression and the nature of the issue, it's likely that the problem lies within the core power operations or the simplification routines of the library. Thus, focusing on the files related to power operations and simplification might help pinpoint the root cause.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves expressions that simplify to inequivalent results when using the `simplify` function in SymPy. The user has provided specific examples where the simplification of expressions containing powers yields unexpected results. This suggests focusing on the code spans related to power manipulation and simplification within the SymPy library. The provided search results include files related to power manipulation (`sympy/core/power.py`) and simplification (`sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`). These files contain methods for handling expressions with powers, properties of the `Pow` class, and simplification functions. We need to identify the relevant code spans within these files to fully understand the mechanisms behind power manipulation and simplification, and where discrepancies might arise.\n\nThe `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` contains methods such as `_eval_refine`, `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, and `as_numer_denom`, which are crucial for handling various aspects of power expressions. These methods directly relate to altering or interpreting expressions involving powers. Additionally, functions like `simplify` in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and `powsimp` in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` are responsible for applying simplification rules to expressions potentially involving powers.\n\nBy analyzing these methods and functions, we can pinpoint sections of code that might be responsible for the reported discrepancy in simplification results. We will select relevant code spans that are directly involved in power simplification specific to the issue described.",

Specifically, we should implement a more careful handling of the exponentiation for complex bases, possibly including special case handling for bases of the form `-x/4 - S(1)/12`.\n\nThe specific modifications required for handling bases of the form `a*x + b` and especially `-x/4 - S(1)/12` should be focused around where base properties are evaluated for computational decisions. This could involve lines where exponentiation logic is defined for different base conditions.",
