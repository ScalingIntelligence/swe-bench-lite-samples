Specifically, the `Pow._eval_power` method in `sympy/core/power.py` handles the power evaluation logic, which is crucial for understanding how the expression `(-x/4 - 1/12)**x` behaves. Additionally, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` defines the logic for simplifying expressions, which is directly related to the reported issue. Both code spans seem relevant to the issue as they directly address the manipulation and simplification of mathematical expressions.
