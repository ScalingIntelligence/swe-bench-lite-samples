The relevant code spans should include methods for handling powers, properties of base and exponent, and methods for evaluating or simplifying powers. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans in files like sympy/core/power.py and sympy/simplify/powsimp.py.

The identified spans are 'Pow.base', 'Pow.exp', 'Pow._eval_subs', 'Pow._eval_expand_power_base', 'Pow._eval_expand_multinomial', 'powsimp', and 'recurse'.
