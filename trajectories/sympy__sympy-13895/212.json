This could be due to the handling of powers and their simplification. The relevant files and methods likely involve those that deal with powers, simplification, and possibly expression evaluation. From the provided context, the `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file seems central to the simplification process and should be a focus. Additionally, methods like `_eval_power` in `sympy/core/power.py` and `_eval_power` in `sympy/core/numbers.py` may be involved in how powers are managed. Also, `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` are crucial for power simplification.",

The task requires identifying code spans related to the simplification of powers and expressions, particularly those dealing with `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and `simplify` functions, as well as their internals such as how powers are handled or how expressions are evaluated numerically. The search results include various files where these functions and related methods are defined. Key spans include the `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, and various methods of the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py`, among others.
