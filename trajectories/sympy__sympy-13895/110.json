            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around an expression that simplifies to an inequivalent expression when using sympy's simplify function. This discrepancy in simplification might be due to how the simplify function handles powers. Given the relevance of 'power' in the issue, focusing on the '_eval_power' method across various classes and exploring the simplify functionality that deals with powers is crucial. Additionally, examining the '_eval_expand_power_base', '_eval_expand_multinomial', and as_real_imag methods can provide insights into how complex expressions involving powers are managed within sympy. The specific file 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' should be checked for functions related to simplification, such as simplify itself or any functions that involve the simplification of power expressions.",
