The traceback provided shows the results of substituting specific values for x, highlighting the discrepancy. The relevant files to inspect would include those dealing with power operations, simplification, and potentially those handling specific mathematical functions or expressions. Given the nature of the problem, focusing on the core power operations, simplification functions, and perhaps specific mathematical functions that could influence the simplification process is crucial. The provided context suggests files like sympy/core/power.py, sympy/simplify/powsimp.py, and sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py could contain relevant code for the simplification process.",
