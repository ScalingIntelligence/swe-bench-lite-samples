This discrepancy occurs in the numerical evaluation of the expressions for a specific value of x, indicating a potential bug in the simplification process. Given the nature of the problem, focusing on the `mul.py`, `power.py`, `numbers.py`, and `simplify.py` files would be prudent since these files are likely to contain the functions responsible for handling powers and their simplifications. Additionally, looking into the `simplify` function within `simplify.py` could provide insight into how the expression simplification is being handled. The `_eval_power` methods in both `Mul` (from mul.py) and the classes in numbers.py are of particular interest as they deal directly with power operations.",
