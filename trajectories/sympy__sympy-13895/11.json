The search results have provided extensive context on how the 'Pow' class handles power operations in the SymPy library, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand. The key methods identified include '_eval_power' and '_eval_subs', which are crucial for evaluating and substituting expressions involving powers. These methods handle special cases such as integer exponents, non-commutative symbols, and the substitution of expressions with similar base or exponent. The 'as_numer_denom' method, while not directly referenced in the issue, is relevant for handling the numerator and denominator in power expressions, which can affect simplification. Overall, the provided code spans cover the essential functionality needed to address the reported issue, making the search task complete. However, it is noted that the search results do not include the actual simplification logic that converts the given expression into an inequivalent form, which might be handled by a different part of the codebase or require further implementation.",
