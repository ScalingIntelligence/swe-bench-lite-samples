This discrepancy highlights the need to examine the code responsible for power simplification and substitution within the SymPy library. The relevant sections of the code involve the definition and evaluation of the `Pow` class, particularly the `__new__`, `_eval_power`, and `_eval_subs` methods. These methods handle the creation of power expressions, the evaluation of power expressions with different exponents, and the substitution of expressions, respectively. By focusing on these methods, we can identify how SymPy handles the simplification of powers and attempt to pinpoint where the issue arises that causes the simplification to result in an inequivalent expression.
