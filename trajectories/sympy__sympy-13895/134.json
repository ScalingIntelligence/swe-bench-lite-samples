The given expression is (-x/4 - 1/12)**x - 1, and after simplification, it transforms to 12**(-x)*(-12**x + (-3*x - 1)**x). This transformation leads to differences in the evaluated results. Focusing on the simplification process, it is crucial to investigate the `simplify` function and its internal workings, including the handling of powers and their expansions. Relevant parts of SymPy to look into would be the `powsimp`, `simplify`, `expands`, and `_eval_power` methods across different classes and modules.",
