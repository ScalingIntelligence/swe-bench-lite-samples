The task is to identify the relevant code spans that deal with power functions and simplification in the provided search results. This involves looking for classes and methods handling power and simplification operations. Given this, the key points to focus on are the ``Pow`` class, ``simplify`` function, and their associated methods such as ``_eval_power``, ``powsimp``, ``powdenest``, and ``radsimp``. These functions and methods are crucial for handling power simplification in SymPy.\n\n1. **sympy/core/power.py** contains the ``Pow`` class which is likely central to handling powers and includes methods like ``_eval_power``, ``_eval_is_negative``, and ``_eval_is_zero``, any of which might be the starting point for identifying the issue.\n\n2. **sympy/simplify/powsimp.py** includes ``powsimp`` and ``powdenest`` functions, which are responsible for simplifying expressions involving powers and nested powers, respectively. These are high-level functions where custom simplification logic for power expressions can be implemented.\n\n3. **sympy/simplify/radsimp.py** and **sympy/simplify/simplify.py** contain the ``radsimp`` and ``simplify`` functions, respectively. Although these primarily deal with radical and general simplification, they may call or be influenced by power simplification routines.\n\nBy examining the ``Pow`` class's ``_eval_power`` method and the ``powsimp`` function, one can understand how SymPy handles power simplifications.\n\n",
