The expression (-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1 simplifies to 12**(-x)*(-12**x + (-3*x - 1)**x) which is not equivalent to the original expression when evaluated at certain values of x. This mismatch suggests a bug or limitation in the simplify function or the underlying algorithms handling power expressions (Pow). The core classes involved are Pow, Float, Rational, Integer, and NegativeOne, which have '_eval_power' methods potentially relevant to this issue. Additionally, the powsimp and radsimp functions in the simplify module might be involved in handling power simplifications and radicals, respectively. It's also worth investigating the instances where 'as_real_imag' and '_eval_is_real' methods are used, as they might relate to how the system treats complex numbers in these expressions. Given the involvement of powers and the simplification process, focusing on these areas should help pinpoint where the simplification logic is failing.",

This issue specifically deals with the handling of power expressions, specifically `Pow` objects, and how they are simplified and evaluated. Given the nature of the issue, the relevant parts of the codebase are likely those dealing directly with power expressions and simplification functions.\n\nFrom the provided search results, several key areas are identified as potentially relevant:\n\n1. **sympy/core/power.py**: This file contains the definition of the `Pow` class, which is central to handling power expressions in SymPy. The properties `base` and `exp` are directly related to the issue as they represent the base and exponent of a power expression. Methods like `_eval_is_negative`, `_eval_is_zero`, and `_eval_power` might contain logic that affects simplification and evaluation of power expressions.\n\n2. **sympy/integrals/rubi/utility_function.py**: While primarily related to integration, there are utility functions related to power expressions, such as `PowerVariableDegree` and `PowerVariableSubst`, which might indirectly affect how power expressions are handled in simplification.\n\n3. **sympy/simplify/powsimp.py**: This file specifically deals with the simplification of power expressions. The `powsimp` function is directly relevant to the reported issue as it is responsible for combining and simplifying powers.\n\n4. **sympy/simplify/radsimp.py**: Although primarily for radical simplification, the handling of bases and exponents in this context might also be relevant to power expressions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most relevant code spans are those directly related to the `Pow` class and its evaluation and simplification methods, as well as the `powsimp` function which is explicitly designed for power simplification. These areas are likely to contain the code that needs to be examined or modified to resolve the issue of incorrect simplification of power expressions.",
