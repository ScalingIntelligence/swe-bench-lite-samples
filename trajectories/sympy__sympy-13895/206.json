The problem lies in the handling of power operations, particularly how powers are expanded or simplified. To address this, we need to focus on the files and methods responsible for power operations and simplification. The files 'sympy/core/power.py', 'sympy/core/numbers.py', and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' are primary candidates as they contain methods for evaluating and simplifying power operations. Also, the 'Pow' class in 'sympy/core/power.py' and the 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' are likely points of interest.",

The key elements to look for in the code are the handling of powers, especially when dealing with negative bases and fractional exponents. The file `sympy/core/power.py` contains the `Pow` class which deals with the exponentiation operation. Relevant methods within this class include `__new__` for creating new instances of `Pow`, `base` and `exp` for accessing the base and exponent of a power, and `_eval_power` for evaluating the power operation. This class is responsible for deciding how to handle different types of bases and exponents, which is directly related to the issue of simplification leading to inequivalent expressions. The file `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` contains the `simplify` function which orchestrates the simplification process. This function calls various sub-functions and could potentially involve the handling of the expression in question. It is also relevant to look at how various numeric types, such as `Float`, `Rational`, and `Integer`, handle exponentiation which can be found in `sympy/core/numbers.py`. In particular, the `_eval_power` methods of these classes are relevant in understanding how exponentiation is computed for these types and potentially identifying inconsistencies. Through this process, the identified code spans are those that deal with the creation, manipulation, and evaluation of powers, as well as the simplification process, which are directly related to the reported issue.",
