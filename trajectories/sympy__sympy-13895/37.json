The example provided involves a power expression that, when simplified using SymPy's `simplify` function, results in a different numerical evaluation, potentially pointing to a logic or simplification rule error within SymPy's power or simplification modules. The initial step is to review the `_eval_power` methods in classes such as `Pow`, `Float`, `Rational`, and other related classes to check for any inconsistencies in power handling. Additionally, the `simplify` function implementation in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and related files like `powsimp.py` and `radsimp.py` should be examined to ensure correct simplification algorithms. The `refine_Pow` function in the assumptions module is also relevant, as it handles assumptions-based refinements of power expressions. Lastly, checking the `ExpandIntegrand` function in the integrals module for any anomalies during expansion procedures can provide further insights.",
