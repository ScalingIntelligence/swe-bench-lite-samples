Given the context, it's clear that the problem lies within the power and simplification logic of the SymPy library. Looking at the provided file snippets, several files are likely relevant due to their handling of power operations and simplification. Specifically, the core/power.py, simplify/powsimp.py, and simplify/simplify.py files are of particular interest as they directly deal with these operations. Additionally, the functions _eval_power and simplify in these files are likely candidates for the source of the issue. Finally, considering the discrepancy in numerical evaluation results, core/numbers.py should also be investigated as it contains definitions for fundamental numerical types.",

Within 'sympy/core/power.py', the 'Pow' class and its methods such as '_eval_power', '_eval_subs', and '_eval_expand_power_base' are directly related to handling powers.

In 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', the 'simplify' function is the central point for simplification operations, which is directly relevant to the issue. Additionally, the 'powsimp' function from 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' is also crucial for simplifying powers. The 'Float', 'Rational', and 'Integer' classes in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' have methods like '_eval_power' which are essential for handling powers with different types of numbers.
