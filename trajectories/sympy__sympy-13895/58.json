By examining the provided search results, we can pin down the specific parts of the code that might contribute to resolving this issue.\n\n1. **sympy/core/power.py**: This file contains the `Pow` class, which is central to handling power operations in SymPy. Specifically, the `_eval_power` method within the `Pow` class needs to be examined to understand how it processes expressions involving powers.\n\n2. **sympy/core/numbers.py**: This file contains various classes like `Float`, `Rational`, `Integer`, and others, each with their own `_eval_power` method. These methods handle power operations for different types of numbers, and understanding their behavior is crucial for the simplification in question.\n\n3. **sympy/simplify/powsimp.py**: This file contains the `powsimp` function, which is responsible for simplifying expressions by combining powers. It's important to understand how it works and if it can be applied to simplify the given expression.\n\n4. **sympy/simplify/simplify.py**: This file contains the `simplify` function, which is the main function used to simplify expressions. It relies on various simplification techniques and tools, including `powsimp`, and understanding its inner workings is essential.\n\nBy focusing on these identified parts of the code, we can deduce the relevant code spans that are most likely to resolve the reported issue.
