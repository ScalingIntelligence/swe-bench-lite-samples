The example provided shows that simplifying the expression (-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1 results in an inequivalent expression. The relevant parts of the code are likely to be found in the handling of powers, particularly the _eval_power methods and related simplification functions. Looking into the Pow class in sympy/core/power.py, the Rational class in sympy/core/numbers.py, and the powsimp function in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py seems appropriate. Additionally, exploring the simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py will be beneficial to understand the overall simplification process.",

The issue seems to be related to how the power operation is handled and simplified. We focus on identifying code spans related to power operations and simplification. Additionally, the simplification involves handling rational numbers and expressions. Thus, evaluating the code spans in powsimp, Pow, Rational, and simplify functions will be beneficial.\n\nFirst, let's analyze 'sympy/core/power.py'. The Pow class and its methods like _eval_power, __new__, base, and exp are relevant because they deal directly with power operations, which are central to the issue. Next, 'sympy/core/numbers.py' contains the Rational class with methods for arithmetic operations and power calculations, potentially helpful for handling components of the expression.\n\n'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' directly addresses simplification of power expressions, specifically the powsimp function, which would be crucial in the current context.\n\nFinally, 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' contains the simplify function itself, which integrates various simplification techniques, making it relevant for handling the overall simplification of the expression. Each of these sections provides key methods and functions that are likely to be involved in handling the expression and its simplification.",
