The files provided suggest that the focus should be on the `_eval_power` methods in the `Pow` class and related classes in `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/core/numbers.py`, and `sympy/core/mul.py`, as well as the simplification functions in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`, and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. Additionally, the `refine_Pow` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` and the `integrand_simplification` function in `sympy/integrals/rubi/rules/integrand_simplification.py` might also be relevant. Given that the simplification process seems to be a focus, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` should be thoroughly reviewed.",
