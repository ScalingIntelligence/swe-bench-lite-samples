This suggests investigating the `simplify` function and related power handling methods in the SymPy codebase. Specific files to focus on include those related to the `simplify` function, power operations (like `Pow`), and potentially the `Rational` and `Integer` classes since the expression includes fractions and integer division. Other relevant functions might involve power simplification or expansion logic.",
