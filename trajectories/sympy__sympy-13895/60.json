The expression in question is `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1`. To address this issue, it's crucial to identify the critical components involved in the simplification process, particularly those related to the `Pow` class, which handles exponentiation. The search results provide a detailed look into the `Pow` class methods and properties, including `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_expand_power_base`. These methods are essential for understanding how exponentiation is handled and how substitutions are evaluated. Additionally, the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is a key method where the reported expression might undergo simplification. By focusing on these elements, we can pinpoint the relevant code spans that directly impact the reported issue.",
