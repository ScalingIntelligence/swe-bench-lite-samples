Key areas of interest include the '_eval_power', '_eval_subs', '_eval_expand_power_base', and '_eval_derivative' methods within the 'Pow' class, as well as the 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' since it directly handles simplification processes. Additionally, considering the nature of the issue, it could involve checking properties like 'base' and 'exp' within the 'Pow' class to understand how bases and exponents are being processed during simplification. It's also important to evaluate if there are special handling mechanisms for certain types of bases like negative or complex bases as these could directly relate to the observed difference in simplification results. Finally, given the interaction between multiple files like 'sympy/core/mul.py' and others, it would be prudent to consider the broader context of how powers and bases are manipulated and simplified throughout the codebase.",
