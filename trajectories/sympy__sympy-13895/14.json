The relevant code spans relate to the handling of powers, multiplications, and simplification functions in SymPy.\n\nThe spans in sympy/core/power.py cover various methods related to the Pow class, including evaluation of modulo, checking if a power is even, substitution, expansion of power bases, differentiation, evaluation with floating point precision, and polynomial checks. These methods are directly related to the manipulation and evaluation of power expressions.\n\nIn sympy/simplify/powsimp.py, the powsimp function is found, which is crucial for simplifying expressions by combining powers with similar bases or exponents. This function is likely to be involved in addressing the simplification issue.\n\nThe Mul class and its related methods in sympy/core/mul.py handle multiplications in SymPy, including evaluation of powers, substitution, and expansion. These functionalities are relevant as multiplications and powers are often intertwined in algebraic manipulations.\n\nThe radsimp function in sympy/simplify/radsimp.py is designed to simplify expressions with radicals, which could be pertinent to the issue at hand if radical expressions are involved in the reported problem.\n\nLastly, the simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is the core function for general simplification in SymPy, handling various types of simplification.

The powsimp function in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py is used for simplifying powers. The Mul class in sympy/core/mul.py contains methods like _eval_power and _eval_subs for evaluating powers and substitutions in Mul expressions. The radsimp function in sympy/simplify/radsimp.py is used for simplifying radicals. The simplify function in sympy/simplify/simplify.py is the main function for simplifying expressions in SymPy, which uses these and other methods to simplify the given expression.
