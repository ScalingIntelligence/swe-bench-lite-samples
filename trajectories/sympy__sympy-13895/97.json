The key elements to focus on are the power operation and the simplification process. From the provided search results, several parts of the code are relevant:\n\n1. In `sympy/core/power.py`, the `Pow` class and its methods are crucial as they handle the power operations. Methods like `_eval_is_integer`, `_eval_subs`, and `_eval_expand_multinomial` are particularly relevant as they deal with different aspects of power operations, including substitution and expansion.\n\n2. In `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py`, the `HyperRep_power1` and `HyperRep_power2` classes are relevant, especially their methods for handling expressions involving powers.\n\n3. In `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, the `powsimp` function is directly related to the simplification of powers, and `powdenest` deals with nesting of powers.\n\n4. Lastly, in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, the `simplify` function and its associated methods are pertinent as they manage the overall simplification process, including handling of powers.\n\nFrom the search results, the identified code spans that are relevant to the reported issue are:\n- `sympy/core/power.py`: methods within the `Pow` class which manage various aspects of power operations.\n- `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py`: classes and methods handling expressions involving powers.\n- `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`: functions related to simplification of powers.\n- `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`: the main `simplify` function and its components.\n\nThese identified spans should help in understanding and potentially resolving the issue where the simplification of an expression results in an inequivalent form.",
