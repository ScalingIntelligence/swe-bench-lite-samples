The '_eval_power' and '_eval_expand_power_base' methods in 'pow.py' are likely to be relevant, as they handle power operations and base expansion, respectively. The 'simplify' function in 'simplify.py' is also a key area to investigate as it processes the simplification of expressions.

The 'simplify' function from 'simplify.py' involves various simplification techniques which could be the source of the discrepancy in comparison to the original expression. Given the relevance of these methods and the broader context in the file, it appears that the provided file context is sufficient to identify the areas that need investigation",
