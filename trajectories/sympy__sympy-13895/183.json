From the search results, the relevant files and spans are those dealing with the power and simplification operations in SymPy, including 'sympy/core/mul.py', 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', 'sympy/core/power.py', and 'sympy/core/numbers.py'. These files contain methods that manage how powers are evaluated and simplified, which is crucial for understanding and resolving the reported issue.\n\nThe 'Mul' and 'Pow' classes in 'sympy/core/mul.py' and 'sympy/core/power.py' respectively, handle the evaluation of power and multiplication operations. However, 'Pow._eval_power' method in 'sympy/core/power.py' has more detailed handling for special cases, especially concerning how bases and exponents are manipulated in complex scenarios. This is vital as the issue involves a complex expression with a power.\n\nIn 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', the 'powsimp' function is responsible for simplifying expressions involving powers, especially improving the readability and logical structure of complex exponentiations. Understanding how this simplification occurs is essential for addressing the reported issue, which specifically looks at the behavior of simplify() on power operations.\n\n'sympy/core/numbers.py' includes various number types and their operations, particularly 'Float', 'Rational', 'Integer', and their respective '_eval_power' methods, which handle exponentiation for these number types. These sections might clarify the behavior of simpler components contributing to the power operation in the complex expression specified in the issue. Understanding these simpler parts' power operations could provide insight into what's happening in the more complex expression.\n\nGiven the complexity and extensive amount of code reviewed, the identified spans show relevant parts that manage power operations and simplifications, directly related to handling the expression type mentioned in the issue. These reflect adequate scope to later analyze and potentially modify to improve the simplification process, making them significant for addressing the provided issue.",
