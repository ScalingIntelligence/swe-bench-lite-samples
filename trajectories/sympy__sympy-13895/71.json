The simplified expression provided by the user seems to produce an unexpected result due to possibly incorrect handling of the power operation or the simplification logic itself. To address this issue, I should focus on identifying the relevant parts of the code that deal with Pow class methods and simplification functions such as simplify, powsimp, and powdenest. I will also look into the _eval_subs method within the Pow class to understand how substitutions are handled during simplification, as well as methods that deal with expanding and simplifying power bases, such as _eval_expand_power_base and _eval_expand_multinomial. The provided search results contain these specific methods, indicating they are relevant to the issue at hand.",

The relevant part of the code (lines 374-480) deals with combining bases and exponents when combine='base'. Specifically, the logic in lines 419-451 handles combining bases with different assumptions (positive, negative, non-negative). The code modifies 'nonneg' and 'neg' lists based on assumptions about the bases, and it might miss handling non-integer exponents or complex expressions correctly. Therefore, lines 419-451 should be modified to ensure correct handling of these cases.",
