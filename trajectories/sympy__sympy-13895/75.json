Given the nature of the issue, it's likely related to the handling of power operations in symbolic mathematics. Therefore, the primary focus should be on the classes and functions that deal with power evaluation and simplification, notably 'Pow', 'Rational', and their methods like '_eval_power' and '_eval_subs'. The context provided includes key files such as 'core/power.py', 'core/numbers.py', 'simplify/powsimp.py', and 'simplify/simplify.py'. Given that we have already identified relevant classes like 'Pow', 'Rational', and key methods within these files, focusing on further specifics within 'simplify/simplify.py' and 'simplify/powsimp.py' might provide additional insights or improvements.",

The issue suggests that the simplification process is not producing a result that matches numerical evaluations. To address this, it's crucial to identify the code spans related to the simplify function and its underlying mechanisms to understand where the simplification process might be deviating from expected behavior. The search results provide several relevant spans, particularly in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' and 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', which contain functions like simplify, signsimp, and powsimp, which are directly involved in the simplification process of mathematical expressions within SymPy. These spans are crucial as they contain the code logic that determines how expressions are simplified, including the handling of complex numbers and other special cases.
