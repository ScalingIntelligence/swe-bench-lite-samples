The search results provide several relevant code spans: 1. `sympy/core/power.py`: This file contains the definition of the `Pow` class and its methods such as `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, and `_eval_expand_multinomial`. These methods are crucial for evaluating power expressions. 2. `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`: This file contains the `powsimp` function, which is used to simplify expressions with powers. 3. `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`: This file contains the `simplify` function, which is the main function for simplifying expressions in SymPy. Given the issue, these code spans are relevant because they deal with the core functionality related to power expressions and their simplification.

Specifically, check and correct the handling of expressions where the base is a negative fraction and the exponent is a variable.\n\nThe existing logic in _eval_power does not explicitly handle cases where the base is a negative fraction and the exponent is a variable. The relevant section is around line 290 where the code checks for e.is_real and handles specific cases like e == -1. This is where enhancements are needed to handle the negative fraction base and variable exponent scenario.",
