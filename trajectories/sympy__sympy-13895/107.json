Analysis of the provided code spans reveals that the `Pow._eval_power` method in `sympy/core/power.py` is critical for handling power evaluations, while the `powsimp` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` is responsible for simplifying powers. The `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` orchestrates the overall simplification process by calling various simplification techniques, including `powsimp`. Identifying these code spans helps in understanding how the reported issue might be addressed.",
