The focus should be on the simplification functions and methods in SymPy, particularly those related to power and exponentiation. The provided context mentions files like `powsimp.py`, `simplify.py`, `power.py`, and others that contain relevant functions and methods. A specific method of interest is `_eval_power` which is used in multiple classes related to numbers and expressions. Additionally, given the simplification step leading to an inequivalent expression, functions like `simplify` and related methods in `simplify.py` are of high relevance.",
