These functions are directly involved in the simplification of expressions and could contain the logic that is causing the inequivalent simplification.\n\nThe identified spans include `Expr.simplify` which calls the `simplify` function from `sympy.simplify`, `powsimp` from `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` which is responsible for combining powers, and `simplify` from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` which is the main function for simplifying expressions. Each of these spans is evaluated based on their relevance to the simplification process and the reported issue.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it is likely that the problem lies within the logic of these simplification functions.
