Given the user's example, the key operations involve handling of powers, simplification, and possibly detecting when expressions are not equivalent due to issues in these operations. \n\nFirst, we examine the search results to identify the most relevant code spans. We start by looking at the file sympy/core/numbers.py and focus on the Rational and Integer classes, particularly their _eval_power methods, as these handle exponentiation for rational and integer bases. This is crucial for understanding how the power operation is performed on such bases.\n\nThe file sympy/simplify/simplify.py is also important as it contains the simplify function which orchestrates the simplification of expressions. Specifically, the function incorporates various simplification strategies including handling of complex expressions, factorization, and dealing with special functions like Bessel functions.\n\nNext, we look at sympy/core/power.py, which has the class Pow representing power operations. The method _eval_power deals with various cases of exponentiation, which are relevant for understanding how powers are computed and simplified.\n\nFinally, sympy/simplify/powsimp.py contains the powsimp function, which concentrates on combining powers in expressions. This function is critical as it directly addresses the combination of terms with the same base, which is a key part of expression simplification.\n\nWe compile the relevant spans from these files, with a focus on the _eval_power methods in Rational, Integer, and Pow classes, the simplify function, and the powsimp function. These snippets collectively present a detailed picture of how powers are managed and how expressions are simplified in the SymPy codebase, which is essential for addressing the reported issue.",
