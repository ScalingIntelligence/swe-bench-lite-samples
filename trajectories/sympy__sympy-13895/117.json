Given the nature of the problem, it's essential to focus on the handling of power operations and simplification in the sympy codebase. The provided context suggests several key files and methods where the issue might lie, particularly within the 'core' and 'simplify' modules. It's necessary to scrutinize the '_eval_power' and '_eval_expand_power_base' methods across relevant classes. Additionally, the simplify function itself and its related utilities should be investigated. Given the discrepancy noted in the substitution and simplification steps, it's crucial to ensure that power operations and their simplification logic accurately handle such expressions, especially when dealing with complex or negative bases and exponents.",

This suggests that the power and simplification functions in SymPy are not behaving as expected. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that handle power evaluation and simplification. \n\n1. I first analyzed the search results for code spans related to power evaluation (e.g., '_eval_power' methods in the Float, Rational, Integer, NegativeOne, NegativeInfinity, and ImaginaryUnit classes from 'sympy/core/numbers.py', and the Pow class from 'sympy/core/power.py'). These are crucial as they handle the core operation of raising an expression to a power, which is central to the issue.\n\n2. Next, I examined code spans related to simplification, such as 'powsimp' and 'powdenest' from 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', which are directly involved in simplifying expressions involving powers. These functions are likely where the issue of inequivalence arises.\n\n3. Additionally, I considered 'radsimp' from 'sympy/simplify/radsimp.py' and the main 'simplify' function from 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', as they handle various aspects of simplification in SymPy, including the simplification of radicals and general expressions.\n\n4. After reviewing the entire sections of code to ensure a complete understanding, I identified the relevant code spans that are directly related to the reported issue. These include the '_eval_power' methods from the classes in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' and the 'Pow' class in 'sympy/core/power.py', as well as the 'powsimp' and 'simplify' functions in their respective files.\n\n5. I also verified that there are no references to other parts of the codebase that might address the issue but were not found in the search results.",
