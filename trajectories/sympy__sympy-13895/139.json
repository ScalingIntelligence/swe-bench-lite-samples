The issue highlights that the simplify function produces an inequivalent expression which leads to different numerical results when replacing x with a certain value. To address this issue, it's important to identify parts of the code related to the `Pow` class and the `simplify` function for handling such algebraic operations. The search results include snippets from `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/core/mul.py`, `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. It's crucial to analyze code spans related to exponentiation, algebraic simplification methods, and checking for equivalence or stability when simplifying expressions. This includes understanding how exponents are handled, especially when combining, simplifying, or when certain substitutions are made. Analyzing these different sections can help pinpoint behaviors like oscillatory or divergent traits that arise from equivalent expression transformations. Because as the issue suggests these behaviors lean away from typical or expected outcomes, it needs to be checked if the discrepancies arise from right-to-left or left-to-right is done certain algebraic transformations leading to different outputs. Looking deeply could surface subtle mathematical points\u2014such as the base change theorem, alteration in sign, or odd vs. even exponent manipulations\u2014that crucially affect algebraic simplification algorithms thereby potentially partially or fully explaining the divergence between the intended and achieved Algebraic Simplifications.",
