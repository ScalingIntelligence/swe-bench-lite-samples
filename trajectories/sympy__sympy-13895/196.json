The user's input indicates that simplifying this expression yields a result that is not equivalent when substituting specific values for x. To address this, we need to analyze the code spans related to power and simplification operations in the provided files, as these operations are likely involved in the simplification process that leads to the problem.\n\nWe examine code spans such as 'Pow._eval_power', 'Mul._eval_power', and functions like 'powsimp' and 'radsimp' from relevant files. These spans and functions handle the evaluation of powers and simplification of expressions, which are directly related to the reported issue.\n\n1. 'Pow._eval_power' deals with the evaluation of powers and checks conditions for integer and rational exponents, which are crucial for correctly handling the expression in the issue.\n2. 'Mul._eval_power' similarly handles power evaluation for multiplication expressions, revisiting this can help in identifying if there's an error in handling combined powers.\n3. 'powsimp' and 'radsimp' functions are dedicated to simplifying powers and radicals, and reviewing their logic might reveal the point where the simplification diverges from expected behavior.\n\nGiven these points, the following code spans are identified as relevant:\n- From 'sympy/core/power.py', spans related to 'Pow._eval_power' and 'Pow._eval_subs'\n- From 'sympy/core/mul.py', spans related to 'Mul._eval_power' and 'Mul._eval_subs'\n- From 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', the entire 'powsimp' function and 'powdenest'\n- From 'sympy/simplify/radsimp.py', the 'radsimp' function\nThese spans are crucial as they directly involve the computation and simplification of expressions involving powers, which is the core of the issue reported.",
