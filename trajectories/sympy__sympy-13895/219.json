The focus should be on understanding the behavior of the `_eval_power` method and other related methods in the codebase that might affect the simplification of power expressions. The relevant files identified so far include `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/core/numbers.py`, `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, and others. Specifically, we need to investigate the methods dealing with power evaluation and simplification, such as `_eval_power`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, `_eval_expand_multinomial`, and `powsimp`. Additionally, we should also look into the `simplify` function itself in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` to understand how it processes power expressions.",
