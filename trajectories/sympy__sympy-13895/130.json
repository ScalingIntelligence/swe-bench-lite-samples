The file context includes sympy/core/power.py, which contains the `Pow` class handling power operations, and sympy/simplify/simplify.py, which includes the `simplify` function. Additionally, sympy/simplify/powsimp.py includes functions related to power simplification. This covers the main aspects needed to investigate and potentially fix the issue of ensuring that (-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1 simplifies correctly. Since the relevant classes and functions are identified, the file context seems sufficient for addressing the issue.",
