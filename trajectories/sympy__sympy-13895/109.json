            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it is evident that the user is experiencing an issue with the simplification of a power expression in SymPy. The key elements in the issue are the power expression and the simplification function. The goal is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that relate to these elements.\n\nFirst, we need to examine the 'Pow' class in 'sympy/core/power.py', as it is likely to contain the methods responsible for handling power operations and their simplification. Specifically, methods like '_eval_power', '_eval_subs', and '_eval_simplify' are likely to be relevant, as they deal with power evaluation, substitution, and simplification respectively.\n\nNext, we need to look at the 'powsimp' function in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py'. This function is explicitly designed for simplifying power expressions, which directly relates to the reported issue. The function 'powsimp' and its underlying methods are crucial for understanding how power expressions are simplified.\n\nLastly, considering the generalization of the issue, we should also look at the 'simplify' function in 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py'. This function is a general-purpose simplification tool in SymPy and might call or be influenced by the specific methods related to power simplification.\n\nBy analyzing these specific parts of the code, we can identify the relevant code spans that address the reported issue.",
