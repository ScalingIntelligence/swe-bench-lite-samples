            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves a power expression that simplifies to an inequivalent expression. The core of the problem seems to be the handling of power expressions, specifically how they are simplified or transformed. Given the context, it's likely that the issue involves the `_eval_power` methods in classes like `Pow`, `Float`, `Rational`, `Integer`, etc., defined in `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py`. Additionally, `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and `radsimp` functions in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` and `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py` may be relevant as they handle simplification of power expressions. The `refine_Pow` function in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` and the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` are also potential candidates as they are involved in refining and simplifying expressions. Given the breadth of possible interactions, a focused search around these areas should be effective in identifying the root cause.",
