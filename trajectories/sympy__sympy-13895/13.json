This discrepancy suggests an investigation into the simplification logic within SymPy, particularly focusing on functions and methods related to power operations and simplification. The files provided in the context indicate that the core of the issue might lie within the power-related evaluations or the simplification algorithms themselves such as `_eval_power` in `Pow` class and `simplify` function. Additionally, attention should be given to the `simplify` module where `powsimp`, `radsimp`, and potentially other simplification methods are defined.",
