The problem might be related to how the Pow class handles exponentiation, especially when dealing with negative bases or fractional exponents. It could also involve simplification functions like `simplify`, `powsimp`, or `powdenest` which are responsible for handling and simplifying powers. Additionally, the `refine_Pow` function in the assumptions module might play a role if it affects how powers are simplified under certain assumptions. Examining these aspects could provide insights into why the simplification is inequivalent.",

The 'Pow._eval_power' method and the 'simplify' function are key, as they handle the evaluation of powers and the overall simplification process, respectively. Specifically, the 'Pow._eval_power' method contains logic for handling different cases of powers, including those with negative bases and integer exponents.
