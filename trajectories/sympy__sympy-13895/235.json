The main focus should be on the handling of power expressions and simplification functions within the sympy library. Relevant files include those defining power operations, simplification methods, and numeric handling. Specifically, the files 'sympy/core/power.py', 'sympy/core/numbers.py', 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' are likely to contain the logic responsible for power evaluations and simplifications. Furthermore, 'sympy/simplify/radsimp.py' and 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py' might also be relevant due to their involvement in simplifying expressions under specific conditions. The function '_eval_power' across different classes in 'sympy/core/power.py' and 'sympy/core/numbers.py' could be particularly critical, as well as the 'powsimp' and 'simplify' functions in 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py' and 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' respectively. Additional scrutiny might be needed for any function or method that processes or transforms power expressions, particularly those involving negative or fractional exponents.",

The second file, 'powsimp.py', contains 'powsimp', a function for simplifying expressions with exponents. These functionalities align directly with the task of ensuring expressions like '(-x/4 - 1/12)**x - 1' do not simplify to an inequivalent expression, as described in the issue.
