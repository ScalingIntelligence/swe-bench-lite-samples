Given the context and the specific expression, it's crucial to focus on code related to power handling, simplification, and possibly substitution using SymPy. The files provided indicate that the code for handling powers, simplification, and substitutions might be spread across multiple files such as `power.py`, `numbers.py`, `simplify.py`, and others. Specifically, functions like `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, and simplification functions like `powsimp`, `radsimp`, `trigsimp`, and `simplify` are of interest. Therefore, the search should concentrate on identifying these functions and related logic in the specified files.",

Each of these files contains sections (`Pow`, `Pow._eval_power`, `Pow._eval_subs`, `Pow._eval_expand_power_base`, `Pow._eval_expand_multinomial`, and others) that are related to the evaluation of powers, substitution, expansion of power bases, and multinomial expansion, all of which are potentially involved in the problem. Additionally, `sympy/core/numbers.py` contains classes such as `Float`, `Rational`, `Integer`, `NegativeOne`, `Infinity`, `NegativeInfinity`, and `ImaginaryUnit`, all of which might be involved in simplifying or evaluating the expression in question. In `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, the `simplify` function is defined, which is likely where the expression is meant to be simplified.
