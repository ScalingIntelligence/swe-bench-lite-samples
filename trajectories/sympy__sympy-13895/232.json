The file `sympy/core/power.py` contains the `Pow` class which is responsible for handling power operations, including the `__new__` method that constructs a `Pow` instance. This method includes logic for handling the base and exponent when creating a `Pow` object, which is relevant to the issue of simplifying power expressions. The `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file defines the `simplify` function, which is crucial for the reported issue as it involves simplifying expressions. This function contains logic for checking if an expression has a custom simplification method and handling the simplification of different types of expressions like `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, and `ExpBase`.
