The focus should be on the `_eval_power` methods in the `Pow` class and other related classes, as well as the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. Additionally, the `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` might be relevant for understanding how powers are handled and simplified. The specific functions and classes to look at are `Pow`, `simplify`, `powsimp`, and `powdenest`.",
