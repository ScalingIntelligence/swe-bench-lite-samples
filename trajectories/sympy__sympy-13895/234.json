The issue seems to focus on the behavior of the Pow class and how it handles certain expressions, particularly those involving negative bases and non-integer exponents. The search results primarily focus on the Pow class in sympy/core/power.py, which is expected since this class is responsible for handling powers and their simplification. The relevant code spans identified are those within the Pow class that deal with evaluation of powers (_eval_power), checking if a power is real (_eval_is_real), substitution (_eval_subs), expansion of power bases (_eval_expand_power_base), expansion of multinomials (_eval_expand_multinomial), evaluation in a numerical context (_eval_evalf), and series expansion around a point (_eval_nseries). These methods are directly relevant to handling and simplification of power expressions, especially those involving non-integer exponents and negative bases, which are the central focus of the reported issue.

These methods include _eval_power, _eval_is_real, _eval_subs, _eval_expand_power_base, _eval_expand_multinomial, and _eval_nseries. These align with the tasks of simplifying expressions involving powers, handling combinatorial expansion, and managing the power operations more generally. Given the breadth and specificity of these methods, it appears that all relevant aspects for addressing the simplification of power expressions (such as the raised issue where (-x/4 - 1/12)^x - 1 simplifies to an inequivalent expression) are covered in the file context. Therefore, based on the methods and functionalities provided, it can be concluded that the file context is comprehensive for addressing the issue at hand without needing further exploration into other parts of the codebase.",
