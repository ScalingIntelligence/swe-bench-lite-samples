The simplified expression behaves differently when evaluated with specific values of x. This suggests that the simplification logic in SymPy might be at fault, particularly in how it handles powers and complex expressions. We should focus our search on files that deal with power operations, simplification, and evaluation. Relevant files are already identified as sympy/core/power.py, sympy/simplify/simplify.py, and sympy/core/numbers.py. Additional files like sympy/simplify/powsimp.py and sympy/simplify/radsimp.py are also likely candidates as they may contain pertinent simplification logic. Given the specificity of the issue, narrow searches within these files are appropriate.",

The most relevant files seem to be `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/core/numbers.py`, `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, as they contain functions and methods that manage operations related to powers, simplification, and numeric evaluations.\n\nFrom `sympy/core/power.py`, the `_eval_subs`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, and `_eval_power` methods within the `Pow` class are relevant as they affect power simplification and substitution, which are central to the issue.\n\nFrom `sympy/core/numbers.py`, the `_eval_power` methods in `Float`, `Rational`, and `Integer` classes are of interest as they handle power operations for different number types, possibly involved in numeric discrepancies.\n\nIn `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, the `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions manage simplification strategies for powers, directly related to the task.\n\nFinally, in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, the `simplify` function and its related operations are fundamental to the reported issue, as it impacts the overall simplification process.\n\nThese methods and functions are crucial for handling the power expressions and their simplification, which are central to resolving the reported issue.",
