These include `power.py`, `numbers.py`, `powsimp.py`, `simplify.py`, `trigsimp.py`, and `mul.py`. Looking into these files, especially focusing on methods like `_eval_power`, `_eval_simplify`, and related functions, should help identify the issue.",

I reviewed the provided search results for code spans that handle power operations (_eval_power methods) and simplification (simplify function). The code spans in sympy/core/power.py, sympy/core/numbers.py, sympy/simplify/simplify.py, and sympy/core/mul.py are highly relevant as they contain methods for handling powers and simplification. These sections cover different classes handling power evaluations and the overall simplification function. Additionally, sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py contains the _eval_power method for the ExpBase class, which is pertinent as the issue involves an exponential expression. Given that these code spans from distinct but core files handle the necessary operations, I believe we have identified the relevant parts to consider for addressing the issue. Thus, the task can proceed with these identified spans.",
