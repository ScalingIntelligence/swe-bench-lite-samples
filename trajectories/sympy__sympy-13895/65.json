The search results provide several key code spans related to Pow, including Pow.__new__, Pow._eval_power, Float._eval_power, Rational._eval_power, and Integer._eval_power. These spans handle the creation of Pow objects, evaluation of powers, and specific cases such as real and integer exponents. The sympy/core/power.py file is particularly relevant as it contains the core logic for handling power expressions. The sympy/simplify/powsimp.py file is also relevant as it deals with simplification of power expressions, which is directly related to the issue reported. The refinement logic in sympy/assumptions/refine.py for Pow expressions can also be relevant for understanding how assumptions affect the simplification of power expressions.",
