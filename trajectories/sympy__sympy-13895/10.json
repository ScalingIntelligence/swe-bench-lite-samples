Given the context provided in the file snippets, it is evident that the simplification logic in SymPy involves several components, including power evaluation, rational number handling, and simplification routines. The relevant files appear to be those that handle power operations and simplification, such as 'power.py', 'numbers.py', 'powsimp.py', and 'simplify.py'. It is crucial to focus the search on these files, particularly on methods like '_eval_power', '_eval_simplify', and 'powsimp', to identify the root cause of the discrepancy. Additionally, since the issue involves power expressions and their simplification, methods within classes like 'Pow', 'Rational', 'Integer', and functions like 'powsimp' and 'simplify' are likely to contain the relevant code snippets.",
