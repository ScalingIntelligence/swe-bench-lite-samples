The issue describes how simplifying an expression leads to an inequivalent result when certain substitutions are made. The primary goal here is to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the simplification process.\n\nThe file context indicates that no relevant code has been identified yet. Starting with the search results, the first step is to look for any code spans that directly relate to the simplify function and its operations. The sympy/core/expr.py file contains a span with the Expr.simplify method, which is a crucial starting point since it defines how simplification is called on an expression.\n\nNext, the sympy/simplify/simplify.py file contains the actual implementation of the simplify function, which is also highly relevant. This file includes the simplify span which provides the core logic for simplifying expressions. Additionally, the presence of helper functions related to simplification like nsimplify within the same module further emphasizes its relevance.\n\nSince the issue also involves expressions that incorporate trigonometric functions, checking for other simplification methods like trigsimp and exptrigsimp in the sympy/simplify/ module is advisable. However, from the provided context, these specific methods are not present directly. It could suggest that the issue's core does not directly involve trigonometric simplification beyond the standard simplify call.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans are those that define or use the simplify function. Therefore, the spans in sympy/core/expr.py and sympy/simplify/simplify.py are identified as pertinent to the reported issue, especially those involving the mechanism and implementation of the simplify function.",
