The primary focus should be on the `simplify` module and related power handling functions within SymPy, as the discrepancy likely arises from how powers are evaluated and simplified. Additionally, the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py` and the `_eval_power` methods in various classes are likely areas of interest due to their direct involvement in power operations. Adding the `simplify` function directly from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` to the search could also help identify the root cause of the simplification failure.",

These files contain methods such as Pow.__new__, Pow._eval_power, Pow._eval_subs, and simplify, which are crucial for understanding how exponentiation and simplification are implemented in SymPy. Additionally, the numbers.py file includes implementations for various types of numbers and their power evaluations, which can affect the simplification process.
