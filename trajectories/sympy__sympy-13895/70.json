This suggests a potential bug or limitation in the `simplify` function or related power handling functions. The relevant files and functions to investigate include those related to power operations and simplification. Specifically, functions like `_eval_power`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, and `_eval_expand_multinomial` in the `Pow` class from `sympy/core/power.py`, as well as the `simplify` function itself in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. Additionally, since the issue involves complex numbers and real numbers, it would be wise to check the `_eval_is_real` method in the `Pow` class and related functions handling complex numbers.",
