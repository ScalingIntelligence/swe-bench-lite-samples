The issue suggests that there might be an error or inconsistency in how the `Pow` class handles exponentiation and simplification. To address this issue, we need to identify code spans that deal with the exponentiation and simplification of expressions involving `Pow`. The search results contain several relevant spans in the `sympy/core/power.py` file, such as `Pow._eval_power`, `Pow.base`, and `Pow.exp`, which are related to how the `Pow` class evaluates powers, accesses the base, and accesses the exponent, respectively. Additionally, the `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file contains the `simplify` function, which is the focus of the issue. Other files like `sympy/core/numbers.py` contain methods like `Float._eval_power` and `Rational._eval_power` which also deal with exponentiation but might not be directly related to the issue at hand. Therefore, the relevant code spans to focus on are those from `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`.",
