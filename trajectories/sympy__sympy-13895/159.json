The original expression (-x/4 - 1/12)**x - 1 is not simplifying to an equivalent expression when the simplify function is applied. The search should focus on identifying functions and modules in SymPy that are responsible for handling expressions related to powers and simplification. Relevant files and classes might include those handling power operations (e.g., Pow in sympy/core/power.py), simplification (e.g., powsimp in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py), and possibly specific handlers for algebraic manipulations. Since the issue involves the handling of powers and their simplification, the focus should be on these specific functionalities.",
