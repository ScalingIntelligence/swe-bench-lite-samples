The search results include several files from the SymPy codebase. The `sympy/core/power.py` file contains the `Pow` class which handles power operations, including the base, exponent, and evaluation methods like `_eval_power`. The `sympy/core/numbers.py` file defines number classes like `Rational` and `Integer`, including their power evaluation methods. Lastly, the `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file contains the `simplify` function which orchestrates simplification of expressions.
