The primary focus should be on the simplification and power handling functions within the SymPy library. The relevant files identified so far include `sympy/core/power.py`, `sympy/core/numbers.py`, `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`, `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, and others. In order to find the exact spot where this simplification fails or misbehaves, we should focus on the `_eval_power` methods within the classes like `Pow`, `Float`, `Rational`, `Integer`, and other number classes. Additionally, the `simplify`, `powsimp`, `powdenest`, and possibly other simplification routines should be examined.",
