To identify the relevant code spans, I need to look for functions and classes related to expression simplification, power evaluation (since the issue involves powers), and possibly handling of specific types of expressions or numbers (e.g., imaginary numbers). From the search results, I identified several potential relevant code spans: \n1. In `sympy/core/mul.py`, the `_eval_power` method within the `Mul` class handles power evaluation for multiplication expressions, which might be relevant to how powers of the expression in question are handled. \n2. In `sympy/core/numbers.py`, the `_eval_power` methods in the `Float` and `Rational` classes handle power evaluation for these specific number types, which might be involved in simplifying the expression in the issue. \n3. In `sympy/core/power.py`, the `_eval_power` method within the `Pow` class evaluates powers, which is directly relevant to the issue since the expression involves powers. Additionally, the `_eval_expand_power_base` method in the `Pow` class expands powers of bases, which could also be relevant to the simplification process.",
