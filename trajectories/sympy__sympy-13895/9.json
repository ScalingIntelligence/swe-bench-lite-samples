The search results provide implementations for Pow._eval_power, Pow._eval_subs, and the simplify function in the simplify/simplify.py module. These methods are crucial for evaluating, substituting, and simplifying expressions, especially those involving powers. The _eval_power method is where the core logic for handling power operations resides, including how powers are combined and simplified. The _eval_subs method deals with substitutions which is also important given the example provided. Finally, the simplify function in the simplify/simplify.py module is where broader simplification strategies are applied, including simplification of powers, logarithms, and other functions. Based on these elements, the identified spans are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the issue.",
