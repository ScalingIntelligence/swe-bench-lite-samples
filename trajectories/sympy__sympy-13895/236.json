Given the context of the issue, it is likely that the bug lies in the handling of power operations or simplification functions within the SymPy library. Relevant files to investigate might include those dealing with power operations (like 'sympy/core/power.py' and 'sympy/core/mul.py') and simplification functions ('sympy/simplify/simplify.py', 'sympy/simplify/powsimp.py', 'sympy/simplify/radsimp.py'). Additionally, looking into 'sympy/core/numbers.py' might help understand how different types of numbers (like Rational and Float) are handled during power operations and simplification. The class names 'Pow' and 'Mul' and the function 'simplify' are particularly relevant.",
