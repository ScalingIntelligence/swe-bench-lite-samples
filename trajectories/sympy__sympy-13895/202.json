The primary focus should be on the simplification functions and power operations within the SymPy library, as these are directly involved in handling the expression (-x/4 - 1/12)**x - 1. Specifically, the _eval_power methods across different classes and the simplify function need to be investigated for potential flaws or incomplete implementations leading to incongruities. Additionally, the _eval_expand_power_base function within the Pow class and the powsimp function in powsimp.py should be reviewed for their role in simplifying the expression.",
