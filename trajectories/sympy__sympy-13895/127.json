The `_eval_power` method in the `Pow` class is particularly relevant as it deals with exponentiation, which is a central part of the reported issue. Additionally, the `simplify` function and its integration with `sympify` and `count_ops` are key components for handling complex simplifications. Overall, the file context seems to encompass the necessary components to address the reported issue related to simplifying expressions that result in inequivalent results.
