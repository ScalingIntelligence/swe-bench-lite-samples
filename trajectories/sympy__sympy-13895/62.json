This could be due to how powers are evaluated or simplified in the code. I will focus the search on files that involve `_eval_power`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, and `_eval_subs` methods across different classes in `sympy/core/`, `sympy/simplify/`, and `sympy/functions/` directories.",

The key elements to focus on are the `Pow` class and its methods, especially those related to evaluation and simplification, such as `_eval_refine`, `_eval_subs`, and the `simplify` function in `powsimp.py`. These methods and functions are crucial for handling power expressions and ensuring they are simplified correctly. Additionally, the issue involves comparing the original expression with the simplified one, which suggests a need to look at properties like `base` and `exp` in the `Pow` class. Given the complexity of the issue, it's important to ensure that the methods involved in simplifying and substituting expressions handle edge cases and different types of exponents accurately.",
