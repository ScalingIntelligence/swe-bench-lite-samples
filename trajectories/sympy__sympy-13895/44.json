The key elements to focus on are the `Pow` class and its methods since the issue involves power operations. Also, the `simplify` function in `sympy.simplify.simplify` is relevant because it is the function used to simplify expressions. 2. Review Current Context: No relevant code has been identified yet, so all search results are new. 3. Process New Search Results: 3.1. For `sympy/core/power.py`, the `Pow` class and its methods are analyzed for relevance, especially `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, `_eval_evalf`, and `_eval_is_integer`. 3.2. For `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, the `simplify` function and its related functionalities are considered. 3.3. For `sympy/core/numbers.py`, the `Rational` and `Integer` classes and their power evaluation methods (`_eval_power`) are checked. 3.4. For `sympy/core/mul.py` and `sympy/core/add.py`, the `Mul` and `Add` classes and their power evaluation methods (`_eval_power`) are evaluated. 3.5. Evaluation of code spans shows that `Pow._eval_power`, `simplify`, and `_eval_power` methods in `Rational`, `Integer`, `Mul`, and `Add` are likely relevant to the reported issue. 3.6. References to other parts of the codebase are not identified in the provided search results. 3.7. Relevant code spans identified are related to the power operations and simplification of expressions. 4. Respond Using the Function: Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified as follows.",
