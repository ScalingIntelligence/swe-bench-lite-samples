The provided search results include the simplify function definition, which is crucial for diagnosing and potentially resolving this issue.

Given the detailed structure of the simplify function, it is likely that the issue could be related to how certain parts of the expression are being handled during the simplification process, such as treatment of powers, logarithms, or complex numbers. Additionally, the presence of specific simplification strategies for sums and products could also be relevant if the expression involves such components.
