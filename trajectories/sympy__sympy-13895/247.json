The files provided in the context are from the `sympy` library and include classes and functions related to power operations, simplification, and number handling. Specifically, attention should be given to methods like `_eval_power`, `_eval_subs`, `_eval_expand_power_base`, `_eval_expand_multinomial`, and functions like `powsimp` and `powdenest`. These methods are likely involved in the simplification process of the given expression. To narrow down the search, focus on the `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` files, as well as relevant methods within `sympy/core/power.py`.",
