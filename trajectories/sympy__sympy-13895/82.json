These include:\n- `Add._eval_power` in `sympy/core/add.py`, which handles power evaluations for sums.\n- `powsimp` and `powdenest` in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py`, which handle the simplification of powers.\n- `log._eval_expand_log` in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, which handles the expansion of logarithmic expressions.\n- `Expr._eval_power` in `sympy/core/expr.py`, which is a general method for handling power evaluations.\n- `radsimp` in `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py`, which simplifies radicals in expressions.\n- `Mul._eval_power` in `sympy/core/mul.py`, which handles power evaluations for products.\n- Various classes in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, which handle power evaluations for specific types of numbers.\n- `Pow._eval_power` in `sympy/core/power.py`, which handles power evaluations for the `Pow` class.\n\nThese spans are likely to contain the logic that is involved in the simplification of the given expression.
