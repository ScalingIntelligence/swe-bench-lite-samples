The behavior suggests that the simplification function or the power evaluation logic might be causing the issue. The focus should be on the power.py, numbers.py, simplify/powsimp.py, simplify/simplify.py, and simplify/trigsimp.py files where power and simplification logic is handled. Additionally, looking into the _eval_power methods in the involved classes might provide more insights. Considering the symbolic nature of the issue, additional focus on the simplify module and its interactions with power evaluations is crucial.",

This requires understanding and identifying the relevant code spans that handle power manipulations, especially in the context of simplifying and expanding powers. We need to focus on methods like _eval_power, _eval_expand_power_base, and _eval_expand_multinomial which are responsible for handling power-related operations within the Pow class. Additionally, the Rational and Integer classes also contain _eval_power methods that might be relevant due to the presence of Rational and Integer objects in the expression. Furthermore, the simplifications involving powers and rational exponents, such as those found in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py and sympy/simplify/simplify.py, should also be considered as they might affect the final outcome of the simplification process. \n\nFrom the search results, the following spans seem most relevant:\n- sympy/core/power.py: Pow (class), Pow._eval_power, Pow._eval_expand_power_base, Pow._eval_expand_multinomial\n- sympy/core/numbers.py: Rational._eval_power, Integer._eval_power\n- sympy/simplify/powsimp.py: powsimp, powdenest\n- sympy/simplify/simplify.py: simplify, posify\n\nThese spans cover the essential operations related to power manipulations and simplifications, including the handling of rational exponents within the context of the reported issue.",
