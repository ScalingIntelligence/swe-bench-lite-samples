The focus should be on the simplification functions, power handling, and potentially related functions such as powsimp, powdenest, expand, and potentially trigonometric simplification functions. Given the expression involves power manipulation and simplification, it's crucial to look into the specific methods like '_eval_power', '_eval_is_real', '_eval_subs', and '_eval_expand_power_base' in the context of the 'Pow' class from sympy/core/power.py. Additionally, the 'simplify' function from sympy/simplify/simplify.py should be examined, as it's likely the entry point for the expression simplification. Trigsimp and powsimp functions could also be relevant as they handle specific aspects of simplification.",
