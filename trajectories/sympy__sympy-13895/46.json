The expected behavior is for the expression to simplify to an equivalent form, but it simplifies to an inequivalent expression. This discrepancy is evident when substituting specific values for x. Given the nature of the issue, it is likely related to the handling of the power operation and simplification in the sympy codebase. Thus, the relevant files and spans of code would be those that handle the power operation and simplification. The search results include multiple files, such as `sympy/core/power.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py`, which are likely to contain the key code spans for handling the power operation. Specifically, the class `Pow` in `sympy/core/power.py` and the methods `_eval_power` for various number classes in `sympy/core/numbers.py` are the likely culprits as they directly deal with the evaluation of power operations.
