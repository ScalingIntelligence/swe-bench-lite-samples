The identified spans in the search results that are relevant to the issue include the _eval_power method in the Pow class, which handles the evaluation of powers, and the simplify function in sympy.simplify.simplify, which is tasked with simplifying expressions. Additional spans in the search results that might be relevant due to their focus on power and rational number handling include the _eval_power methods in the Rational and Integer classes, and the _eval_expand_power_base method in the Pow class.
