This suggests problems in how the simplification function processes expressions involving powers and rational numbers. Therefore, the focus should be on parts of the code related to power handling and simplification, particularly where powers and rational numbers are involved. The relevant files might include those handling power operations, rational number operations, and simplification algorithms.
