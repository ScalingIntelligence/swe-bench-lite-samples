The code spans provided cover multiple files related to power operations and number handling in SymPy. The spans relevant to the issue are those that handle power evaluation and simplification of expressions containing powers. For instance, Pow class methods such as _eval_power, _eval_expand_power_base, and _eval_expand_multinomial in sympy/core/power.py are directly related to how powers are evaluated and simplified. Additionally, methods like _eval_power in sympy/core/numbers.py for Integer, Rational, and Float classes are relevant as they dictate how these numeric types behave when raised to a power in calculations. Lastly, functions like powsimp in sympy/simplify/powsimp.py and simplify in sympy/simplify/simplify.py are pivotal since they are specifically designed to simplify expressions that include powers, potentially impacting the reported issue where simplification of a complex power expression is the focus.",

The issue lies in the handling of the exponentiation of the base in the Pow class, specifically in the _eval_power method. The change applied attempted to correct this by ensuring the simplification does not alter the equivalence, but the provided diff shows that the simplification function was used incorrectly. Instead, the evaluation should be handled with care to maintain equivalence, possibly by avoiding automatic simplification in such complex cases.",
