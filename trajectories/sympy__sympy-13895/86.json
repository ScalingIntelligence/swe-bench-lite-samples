The provided files suggest that the problem might be related to how powers are handled in the 'sympy' library, specifically in files like 'power.py', 'numbers.py', 'simplify/powsimp.py', among others. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on classes and methods that deal with power evaluation, simplification, and expansion seems relevant. Specifically, looking into the '_eval_power' methods in the classes from 'numbers.py' and 'power.py', as well as the 'powsimp' function in 'simplify/powsimp.py' could be beneficial. Additionally, considering the stack trace examples in the issue, which involve substitution and evaluation of expressions, methods like '_eval_subs', '_eval_evalf', and '_eval_nseries' might also be of interest.",

The search results provide relevant code spans that handle power operations, substitutions, and simplifications in the SymPy codebase. These includes methods like _eval_subs, _eval_expand_power_base, _eval_expand_multinomial, and _eval_power, which are critical for handling power operations within the `Pow` class. Additionally, the `powsimp` and `powdenest` functions are pertinent as they handle the simplification of powers.
