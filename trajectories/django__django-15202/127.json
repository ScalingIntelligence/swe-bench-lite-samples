This behavior is inconsistent with expected Django form behavior. By examining the provided file context, it is evident that the URLField class directly inherits from CharField and incorporates a URLValidator. The clean method in URLField attempts to handle the splitting and reforming of URLs, but it does not address the specific issue of ValueError conversion to ValidationError within its to_python method. Similarly, the URLValidator in django/core/validators.py includes a method that catches ValueError during URL parsing and raises a ValidationError instead, which aligns with the expected behavior. These findings suggest that the code provided could be modified to solve the issue by adjusting error handling in the URLField, ensuring that ValueErrors are appropriately converted to ValidationErrors. However, since the specific method raising the ValueError is not directly provided in the file context (the traceback points to 'urlsplit' from 'urllib/parse.py'), additional context might be needed to fully resolve the issue.",
