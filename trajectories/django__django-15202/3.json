From the provided context, it's evident that the problem occurs within the URLField class and its clean method. The traceback suggests that the issue arises from the URL validation process within the django.forms.fields module. Additionally, the error originates from the urllib.parse.urlsplit function, indicating that the fault may lie in how the URL is being parsed or validated. To address this, we should focus our search on the URLField class within the django.forms.fields module and also look into the URLValidator class within the django.core.validators module. Furthermore, since the error specifically mentions an 'Invalid IPv6 URL', it might be beneficial to scrutinize the part of the code dealing with IPv6 URL validation.",
