The issue mentions that a ValueError is raised instead of a ValidationError when an invalid URL is provided. This suggests that the error handling within the `to_python` method of URLField is of particular interest.\n\nAdditionally, the search results include portions of the URLValidator class and its methods, which are also relevant as they handle the validation of URLs. The `__call__` method of URLValidator is particularly important as it includes the handling of ValueErrors and the conversion of URLs using `urlsplit` and `urlunsplit`. This method's behavior directly relates to the issue of ValueErrors not being properly caught and replaced with ValidationErrors.\n\nFinally, the inclusion of the GenericIPAddressField class and its methods is not directly relevant to the issue at hand as it pertains to IP address validation rather than URL validation. However, it's worth noting the different approach to error handling in that class as a point of comparison.\n\nTaking these elements into account, the relevant code spans are those within the `to_python` method of URLField and the `__call__` method of URLValidator.",
