The URLField class inherits from CharField, which in turn inherits from Field. The Field class has a method 'clean' which is important for validating input. The URLField class overrides this 'clean' method and uses the URLValidator for URL validation. The URLValidator class contains logic for validating URLs, including handling IPv6 addresses.
