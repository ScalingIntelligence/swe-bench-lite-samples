It includes a `split_url` function that attempts to split the URL and raises a ValidationError if a ValueError occurs, which partially addresses the issue but might not be comprehensive enough.\n3. **URLValidator class and its `__call__` method**: This class and method are essential for validating URLs. The `__call__` method includes error handling for ValueErrors during URL splitting, which seems to address the exact problem described.\n4. **validate_ipv6_address function**: This function validates IPv6 addresses and raises a ValidationError if the address is invalid, which is relevant to the issue's context.\n\nThese spans collectively provide the necessary context and code to address the issue of the URLField raising a ValueError instead of a ValidationError.
