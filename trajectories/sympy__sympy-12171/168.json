Specifically, the class already contains methods for handling various expressions such as 'Pow', 'Mul', 'Pi', 'Infinity', 'Function', 'Integral', and 'Sum'. However, there are no specific methods for 'Derivative' and 'Float' in the provided code spans, which indicates that these need to be added to correctly handle derivatives and floats as per the issue description. The inclusion of these methods will align the printer with the requested functionalities, ensuring that derivatives are printed in Mathematica D[...] format and floats in the 1.0*^-4 format instead of the standard exponential notation. The identified spans do not currently cover these functionalities, so new methods must be implemented as suggested in the issue report.",

Specifically, the issue highlights two main problems:\n\n1. Derivative(func(vars), deriver) is not printed correctly. For example, Derivative(f(t), t) should yield D[f[t],t] but instead yields Derivative(f(t), t).\n2. Floats with exponents are not handled correctly. For example, 1.0e-4 should be converted to 1.0*^-4.\n\nIn the provided file context, we see the MCodePrinter class in sympy/printing/mathematica.py, which is the relevant file for addressing the issue. The class includes methods for handling specific types of expressions, such as Pow, Mul, Pi, Infinity, etc., but missing are the methods for handling Derivatives and Floats as described in the issue.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, we find two other files: sympy/printing/latex.py and sympy/printing/fcode.py. These files contain methods for handling Derivatives and Floats, but they belong to different printers (LatexPrinter and FCodePrinter) and are not directly relevant to the MCodePrinter.\n\nGiven the context provided and the search results, the existing MCodePrinter class should include the methods suggested in the issue: _print_Derivative and _print_Float. These methods are not currently implemented in the provided context but are necessary to address the reported issue. Therefore, the task is not complete as the relevant code spans are not present in the provided context or search results.
