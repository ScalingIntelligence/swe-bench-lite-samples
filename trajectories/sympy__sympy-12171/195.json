The search results provide various files and spans that handle printing for different formats, including Mathematica, LaTeX, MathML, and more. For the Mathematica code printer, the relevant file is 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py', which contains the 'MCodePrinter' class. However, the search results do not directly include the methods '_print_Derivative' and '_print_Float' in 'MCodePrinter', which are crucial for addressing the issue. Instead, these methods are found in other printers like 'StrPrinter' and 'LatexPrinter'. To fix the issue in 'MCodePrinter', the suggested changes must be implemented there. The search results for 'MCodePrinter' do not currently include the specific methods needed for the fix, so more search is required or the fix needs to be directly applied in 'MCodePrinter'.",

I analyzed the provided search results and identified that the current implementations of _print_Derivative and _print_Float in the StrPrinter and LatexPrinter classes do not address these issues. The MCodePrinter class, which is the relevant class for Mathematica code printing, was not found in the search results. Therefore, the fix suggested in the reported issue, involving methods _print_Derivative and _print_Float within MCodePrinter, is necessary but not yet implemented in the existing codebase. Given this context, I identified the relevant spans in the LatexPrinter and StrPrinter classes for reference, as these classes also handle printing of derivatives and floats but using different formats (LaTeX and string, respectively). The search task is thus not complete, as the MCodePrinter implementation is crucial for addressing the reported issue and was not found among the search results.",
