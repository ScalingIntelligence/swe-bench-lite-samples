Specifically, the Derivative function should output in the Mathematica format 'D[f[t], t]' instead of 'Derivative(f(t), t)', and floats with exponents should be converted to a specific Mathematica syntax (e.g., 1.0e-4 should be 1.0*^-4). Given the relevance of the 'MCodePrinter' class in the 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' file context, it is likely that the code handling these specific prints resides in or should be added to this class. Furthermore, the '_print_Float' method should be adapted to handle the exponent conversion. Two search requests are needed: one to check if the '_print_Derivative' method exists and correctly formatted, and another to identify or implement the '_print_Float' method with the correct output format.",

To address this, modifications to the MCodePrinter class are suggested in the issue report with new methods _print_Derivative and _print_Float. Upon analyzing the search results, relevant code spans can be found in the MCodePrinter class within mathematica.py for potential modifications to address the issue. Additionally, analogous methods (_print_Float and _print_Derivative) in other printers (like StrPrinter, LatexPrinter, and PrettyPrinter) can serve as references for how to implement these changes. Thus, the relevant files and spans identified are 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' for MCodePrinter and spans related to _print_Float and _print_Derivative in other files to draw inspiration and methods.",

The task is to identify relevant code spans related to these issues in the provided search results. The current file context provided indicates that MCodePrinter does not handle these cases, while StrPrinter and LatexPrinter already have methods to handle Float and Derivative, but they need to be implemented or corrected in MCodePrinter.\n\nAnalyzing the new search results, the focus should be on identifying any classes or methods in the codebase that deal with printing Mathematica code, particularly methods related to Derivative and Float. The search results include a significant portion of the PrettyPrinter class, which handles print methods for various mathematical expressions, including Derivative and Float. However, these specific methods are currently handled in the StrPrinter and LatexPrinter classes or need to be implemented in the MCodePrinter class for the Mathematica code printer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue are the _print_Derivative and _print_Float methods in the PrettyPrinter class, as they provide a basis for how these expressions should be printed in a pretty format, which aligns with the expected output format for Mathematica code printing. These methods in the PrettyPrinter class serve as a reference for implementing similar functionality in the MCodePrinter class for Mathematica code printing.

Specifically, the code from these methods will be used to modify or create the corresponding methods in the MCodePrinter class in sympy/printing/mathematica.py to meet Mathematica's code printing conventions. The '_print_Derivative' methods format derivatives for LaTeX, string printing, and pretty printing, respectively, which can guide the adaptation for Mathematica's 'D[f[t], t]' format. The '_print_Float' methods handle float representation, which can guide the conversion of 1.0e-4 to 1.0*^-4 as required. The search seeks precise implementations of these methods in the given files to adapt their logic into the MCodePrinter class.",
