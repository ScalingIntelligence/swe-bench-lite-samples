Specifically, Derivative(f(t), t) should yield D[f[t],t] instead of the current output, and floats with exponents should be converted to Mathematica's format 1.0*^-4. The suggested fixes involve modifying the MCodePrinter class by adding _print_Derivative and _print_Float methods. Given the context provided, it's clear that the relevant file is sympy/printing/mathematica.py, which already contains definitions for MCodePrinter. The search should focus on this file to locate the existing _print_Derivative and _print_Float methods if they exist, or any related handling of derivatives and floats, to determine the best place for the suggested fixes.",
