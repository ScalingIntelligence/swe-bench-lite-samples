This includes, among others, that Derivative(f(t), t) should yield D[f[t],t] and floats with exponents like 1.0e-4 should be converted to 1.0*^-4. I then reviewed the current file context and found no previously identified relevant code. I then turned to analyze the new search results which led me to identify all sections of MCodePrinter, MathMLPrinter, StrPrinter, LatexPrinter, ReprPrinter, FCodePrinter, MpmathPrinter, TheanoPrinter, and PrettyPrinter that dealt with _print_Derivative and _print_Float. In these results, I found that _print_Derivative mainly focuses on formatting the derivative expression for different print methods and types of output like LaTeX or MathML. _print_Float, on the other hand, handles the conversion of floats to strings, including the representation of floats with exponents. These methods will need to be adapted to handle the specific case of Derivative(f(t), t) being converted to `D[f[t],t]` and for floats having exponents being converted as `1.0*^-4`. Thus, sections MCodePrinter, StrPrinter, LatexPrinter, ReprPrinter, and FCodePrinter have been identified as relevant for addressing the reported issue.",
