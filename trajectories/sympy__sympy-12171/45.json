Specifically, the Derivative function should yield 'D[f[t],t]' instead of 'Derivative(f(t), t)', and floats with exponents should be correctly converted. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that handle these specific issues. \n\n1. Analyzing the reported issue, the key functions to focus on are the handling of Derivative and Float, as noted in the suggested fix. \n2. Reviewing the search results, several files contain mentions of Derivative and Float handling, including 'mathematica.py', 'latex.py', 'mathml.py', 'pretty.py', and 'str.py'. \n3. The file 'mathematica.py' contains the 'MCodePrinter' class which is the most relevant for the Mathematica code printer. The methods '_print_Derivative' and '_print_Float' are defined in other files but not in 'mathematica.py', suggesting this class needs updates. \n4. The relevant code spans in 'mathematica.py' are: \n   - <span id='MCodePrinter'> which defines the class containing the methods that need updating. \n   - <span id='MCodePrinter.__init__'> which includes initialization settings that might influence the printing methods. \n\nBased on the analysis, the search results do not include existing implementations of '_print_Derivative' and '_print_Float' for the 'MCodePrinter' class in 'mathematica.py'. Therefore, the identified code spans are primarily the class definition and constructor, suggesting the methods need to be implemented as indicated in the reported issue.",
