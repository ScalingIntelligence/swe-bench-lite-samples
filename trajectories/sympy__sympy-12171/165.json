The provided files context suggests that the relevant code might be located within the 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' file, as this is the file that contains the MCodePrinter class. To address the issue, we need to find the methods responsible for printing derivatives and floats in this class. Based on the issue description, the '_print_Derivative' method is likely to exist in the MCodePrinter class, but it does not currently handle derivatives correctly. Similarly, the '_print_Float' method should handle floats but needs adjustments for exponents. Therefore, the search should focus on locating these methods within the 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' file.",

The issue mentions derivatives not converting correctly to 'D[f[t],t]' and floats not converting exponents correctly, e.g., '1.0e-4' to '1.0*^-4'. Given the search results, there are several files and spans that deal with derivatives and floats across different printers such as StrPrinter, LatexPrinter, PrettyPrinter, etc. The most relevant files seem to be those containing the methods _print_Derivative and _print_Float in the sympy.printing module, which directly relate to printing derivatives and floats. The spans _print_Derivative and _print_Float in the StrPrinter, LatexPrinter, and PrettyPrinter classes are particularly relevant to this issue. These spans provide the current implementation for printing derivatives and floats, which need to be adjusted according to the required changes specified in the issue. Additionally, other files like mathml.py, repr.py, fcode.py, lambdarepr.py, and theanocode.py have similar methods, but their implementations may not directly affect the Mathematica code printer's handling of derivatives and floats. Therefore, the focus will primarily be on the relevant spans within the sympy/printing/str.py, sympy/printing/latex.py, and sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py files.",
