To address the first issue, the code needs a method to convert 'Derivative(f(t), t)' to 'D[f[t],t]'. For the second issue, the code needs a method to convert floats with exponents to the Mathematica format. From the search results, we can identify relevant code spans in the 'MCodePrinter' class for addressing both issues. Specifically, we can look at the 'MCodePrinter' class definition and the related method '_print_Derivative' where the derivative printing logic could be modified. Additionally, the '_print_Float' method in 'MCodePrinter' could be modified to convert floats with exponent notation as required. The 'StrPrinter' class in 'sympy/printing/str.py' also contains implementations for '_print_Derivative' and '_print_Float' methods which may serve as a reference for the required changes. However, the necessary modifications should be made in the 'MCodePrinter' class to ensure the Mathematica code printer works as expected.",
