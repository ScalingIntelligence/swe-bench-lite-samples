Although the current search results do not directly include the methods for handling Derivative and Float, the class MCodePrinter is likely the correct place to implement the fixes.\n\nThe class MCodePrinter in the search results already includes methods for printing various mathematical expressions, indicating it's responsible for generating Mathematica code. This context makes it suitable to add the proposed fixes, ensuring that when Derivative and Float types are encountered during printing, they get handled in accordance with Mathematica's syntax. \n\nGiven these points, while the detailed methods for Derivative and Float aren't present in the search results, based on where the printing methods are located, we can infer that implementing the fixes identified in the reported issue in the class MCodePrinter will likely resolve the problems, merging the knowledge from the issue with the context provided by the existing code.
