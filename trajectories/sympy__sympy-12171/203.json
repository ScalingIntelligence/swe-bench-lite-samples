Specifically, it should convert derivatives like Derivative(f(t), t) to D[f[t], t] and floats with exponents like 1.0e-4 to 1.0*^-4. From the provided context, it appears that the relevant file is sympy/printing/mathematica.py which contains the MCodePrinter class. This class likely needs to implement or update the _print_Derivative and _print_Float methods to address the issue. It's reasonable to check this file for the existing implementations of these methods or to add them if they are missing.",
