The Derivative(func(vars), deriver) should yield D[func[vars],deriver] instead of Derivative(func(vars), deriver). Similarly, floats with exponents should be converted from 1.0e-4 to 1.0*^-4. Given the nature of the issue, the focus should be on the MCodePrinter class in the mathematica.py file, as it is likely where the fixes need to be applied. The search request should specifically target functions related to Derivative and Float within the MCodePrinter class.",

Specifically, it mentions that Derivative(f(t), t) should yield D[f[t], t] instead of Derivative(f(t), t), and floats with exponents should be converted to 1.0*^-4. In the provided search results, there are relevant code spans in sympy/printing/latex.py and sympy/printing/str.py that handle Float and Derivative printing. The LatexPrinter class in latex.py has methods for printing Float and Derivative, which could potentially be adapted or studied for the Mathematica printer. Similarly, the StrPrinter class in str.py also has a _print_Float method that deals with printing floats, which could be useful for understanding the float handling logic. Additionally, the FCodePrinter class in fcode.py has a _print_Float method that handles floats specifically for Fortran code, which might also offer insights into float handling. I will identify the relevant spans for further review.",
