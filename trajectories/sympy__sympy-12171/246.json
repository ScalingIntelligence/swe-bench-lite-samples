The key elements to identify in the search results are functions related to printing Derivative and Float in the context of the MCodePrinter class within the Mathematica.py file. Additionally, it's crucial to understand how existing printers handle these types to ensure a comprehensive fix. \n\nIn the search results, several relevant sections are identified. Specifically, within the mathematica.py file, the MCodePrinter class is found, which is the primary focus. No existing methods for handling Derivative or Float are present in this class, indicating that these will need to be added. In the context of derivatives, other printers like MathMLPrinter, StrPrinter, LatexPrinter, and VectorStrPrinter have relevant methods (_print_Derivative) that could serve as a template for implementation in MCodePrinter. For the handling of floats, similar examination of other printers' methods (_print_Float in StrPrinter, LatexPrinter, ReprPrinter, etc.) can guide the implementation in MCodePrinter.\n\nGiven these findings, the search results include sufficient context to begin implementing the necessary changes in the MCodePrinter class in the mathematica.py file.

The provided search results contain multiple files and spans of code. The relevant files to address the issue are: `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`, `sympy/printing/str.py`, `sympy/printing/latex.py`, and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. These files contain classes and methods related to printing expressions in different formats (Mathematica, string, LaTeX, and pretty print). Specifically, the `MCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` is the main class for Mathematica code printing. The `StrPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/str.py` is responsible for string representation of expressions. The `LatexPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/latex.py` handles LaTeX printing. The `PrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` is for pretty-printed output. The issue suggests adding specific methods to the `MCodePrinter` class to handle derivatives and floats correctly. The relevant spans of code to look at are the ones handling derivatives (`_print_Derivative`) and floats (`_print_Float`) in the mentioned classes. The search results do not provide the exact implementation of these methods in the `MCodePrinter` class, which is necessary to implement the suggested fixes. Therefore, these methods need to be added to the `MCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`, while ensuring they do not already exist.",
