Specifically, the Derivative function is not converting to the expected Mathematica syntax (D[f[t],t]) and floats with exponents are not being converted correctly either (e.g., 1.0e-4 should be 1.0*^-4). Given the context provided, it is clear that the MCodePrinter in the 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' file is the most likely place to implement the fixes. This is because the MCodePrinter class handles the conversion of SymPy expressions into Mathematica code. Thus, further investigation into this class is necessary to locate the methods responsible for printing derivatives and floats.",
