Specifically, it mentions that the Derivative function is not correctly converted to Mathematica's D function, and floats with exponents are not properly formatted. The provided search results span multiple printer classes across different files, including StrPrinter, LatexPrinter, ReprPrinter, FCodePrinter, MpmathPrinter, TheanoPrinter, PrettyPrinter, and VectorStrPrinter, VectorLatexPrinter, and VectorPrettyPrinter in the physics.vector module.\n\nFor the Derivative handling, relevant spans include `StrPrinter._print_Derivative`, `LatexPrinter._print_Derivative`, `MathMLPrinter._print_Derivative`, `TheanoPrinter._print_Derivative`, and versions of this function in the physics.vector module (VectorStrPrinter, VectorLatexPrinter, and VectorPrettyPrinter). These spans demonstrate how Derivative is currently handled in different contexts, which could be a starting point for implementing the desired change from `Derivative(f(t), t)` to `D[f[t],t]`.\n\nFor floats with exponents, relevant spans include `StrPrinter._print_Float`, `LatexPrinter._print_Float`, `ReprPrinter._print_Float`, `FCodePrinter._print_Float`, `MpmathPrinter._print_Float`, and `PrettyPrinter._print_Float`. These spans show how floats are currently printed in various formats and can serve as a basis for modifying the behavior to replace 'e' with '*^', as required.\n\nGiven the breadth of the search results, it's evident that there are many places in the codebase where the printing of Derivatives and Floats is addressed. This suggests that making a consistent change across all affected areas could be the key to resolving the issue.",

I ensured to consider full sections of code when evaluating relevance, focusing on methods named `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float`. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans were identified across the different files. The identified spans include definitions of `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` methods in the corresponding printer classes.
