The search results contain several code spans across different file paths in the sympy directory. Notably, the MCodePrinter class in sympy/printing/mathematica.py is a likely candidate for the fix related to derivatives and floats since it is a CodePrinter specialized for Mathematica code. Additionally, various printers such as LatexPrinter, StrPrinter, MathMLPrinter, and others have methods for printing Derivative and Float. However, the specific methods for Derivative and Float in MCodePrinter are missing from the provided search results, suggesting that the relevant code spans are not present in the provided snippets.
