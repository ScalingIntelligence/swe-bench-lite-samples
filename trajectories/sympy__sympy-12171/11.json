Based on the snippets provided, it seems that the MCodePrinter class is likely to be found in sympy/printing/mathematica.py. Additionally, since the issue also mentions handling floats, we should check for _print_Float methods in the same or related files where MCodePrinter is defined.

The exploration of 'sympy/printing/str.py' and 'sympy/printing/codeprinter.py' is crucial to replacing or modifying functions like _print_Derivative and _print_Float to satisfy the requirements. However, it appears that currently, many support functions for printing are not implemented in 'sympy/printing/codeprinter.py', with several needed functions marked as '_print_not_supported' (e.g., _print_Derivative). This indicates an area where the existing printer classes would need modifications or a new implementation that overrides these '_print_not_supported' statuses. The '_print_Float' function in 'sympy/printing/str.py' also does not handle floating-point arithmetic with replacement of 'e' with '*^' as needed for Mathematica printing.",
