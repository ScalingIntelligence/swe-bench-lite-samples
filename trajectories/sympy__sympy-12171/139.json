The problem with derivatives is that they are not correctly translated into Mathematica's D[...] notation, and floats with exponents are not converted properly (should use *^ instead of e). From the provided context, the relevant class is MCodePrinter, which is likely found in the file 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py'. This file should be inspected for the methods '_print_Derivative' and '_print_Float'. The other files are not as relevant as they pertain to other types of code printers or handle different aspects of the problem. However, looking at how '_print_Float' is handled in other printers (like LatexPrinter and FCodePrinter) might provide useful insights into possible implementations.",
