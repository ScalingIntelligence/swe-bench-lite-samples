Specifically, the current implementation for Derivative and Float printing is inadequate, with no existing methods to support the conversion of Derivative(func(vars), deriver) to D[func[vars], deriver] format, and floats with exponents not converted to the correct Mathematica format (e.g., 1.0e-4 should be 1.0*^-4).\n\nGiven the file context provided, it's clear that the MCodePrinter class in 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' is the one currently used for Mathematica code printing. However, it lacks specific methods for handling Derivatives and Floats as per the required fix.\n\nIn the search results, two other printers are shown: LatexPrinter in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' and TheanoPrinter in 'sympy/printing/theanocode.py'. These might offer insights into how to handle Derivatives and Floats but aren't directly relevant to Mathematica code printing. In LatexPrinter, there is a method for printing Floats (_print_Float) that splits the mantissa and exponent and formats them accordingly. This logic could potentially be adapted for the Mathematica printer. Similarly, the _print_Derivative method in LatexPrinter constructs the derivative expression in LaTeX format, which includes differentiating between partial and total derivatives. This logic could guide how to format derivatives in Mathematica.\n\nBased on the analysis, I decide to provide 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' with the required methods (_print_Derivative and _print_Float) adapted potentially from LatexPrinter or with inline logic to address the stated issue directly.",

The issue specifies that floats with exponents are not converted correctly, and Derivatives are not printing in the expected Mathematica format. The suggested fix includes methods to correct these issues within the MCodePrinter class.\n\nGiven the search results, it's evident that the current file context does not include methods for handling Derivative and Float in the MCodePrinter class, which aligns with the reported issue. However, in the search results, both the LatexPrinter and TheanoPrinter classes include methods for handling Derivative and Float, which could be adapted for use in the MCodePrinter.\n\nThe LatexPrinter class has a _print_Derivative method that formats derivatives for LaTeX, and a _print_Float method that handles floats formatting for LaTeX. Similarly, TheanoPrinter has a _print_Derivative method that handles derivatives for Theano, though its approach might not be directly applicable without adaptation.\n\nBased on this analysis, to address the issue, it would be beneficial to implement the suggested _print_Derivative and _print_Float methods in the MCodePrinter class, drawing inspiration from the corresponding methods in LatexPrinter. This could effectively resolve the formatting issues for floats and derivatives in the Mathematica code printer.\n\nGiven the current context and search results, it would suggest identifying the specific spans in the search results that are most relevant to adapt for the solution within the MCodePrinter class.",
