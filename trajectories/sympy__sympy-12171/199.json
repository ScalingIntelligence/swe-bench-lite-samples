  "initial_message": "matematica code printer does not handle floats and derivatives correctly\nIn its current state the mathematica code printer does not handle Derivative(func(vars), deriver) \r\ne.g. Derivative(f(t), t) yields Derivative(f(t), t) instead of D[f[t],t]\r\n\r\nAlso floats with exponents are not handled correctly e.g. 1.0e-4 is not converted to 1.0*^-4\r\n\r\nThis has an easy fix by adding the following lines to MCodePrinter:\r\n\r\n\r\ndef _print_Derivative(self, expr):\r\n        return \"D[%s]\" % (self.stringify(expr.args, \", \"))\r\n\r\ndef _print_Float(self, expr):\r\n        res =str(expr)\r\n        return res.replace('e','*^') \r\n\r\n\r\n\n"
