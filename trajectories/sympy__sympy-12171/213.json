            "scratch_pad": "The issue is related to the incorrect handling of floats and derivatives in the Mathematica code printer. Specifically, the Derivative function should be converted to 'D[f[t],t]' instead of remaining as 'Derivative(f(t), t)'. Similarly, floats with exponents should be converted from '1.0e-4' to '1.0*^-4'. From the context provided, it's clear that this issue is associated with the MCodePrinter class in the mathematica.py file. To address this, we need to find and modify the existing methods for _print_Derivative and _print_Float in the MCodePrinter class. If these methods do not exist, we will need to create them. Notably, the MCodePrinter class does not currently contain these methods, so we will need to precisely locate where they should be added.",
