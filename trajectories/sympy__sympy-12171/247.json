Specifically, the code spans that are relevant are those that deal with printing derivatives and floats.\n\nFor handling derivatives, the `_print_Derivative` method needs to be implemented or modified within the MCodePrinter class. For floats, the `_print_Float` method needs similar attention.\n\nFrom the search results, there are several `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` methods in different printer classes, but none within the MCodePrinter class.

Specifically, it needs to correctly print Derivative(f(t), t) as D[f[t],t] and handle floats with exponents properly. Based on the issue, we need to fix the _print_Derivative and _print_Float methods in the MCodePrinter class. The search results provide implementations of these methods in various printer classes, such as LatexPrinter, MathMLPrinter, and StrPrinter. For the MCodePrinter, we need to implement or modify these methods to match the required functionality. From the search results, we can see that StrPrinter and LatexPrinter have existing implementations for _print_Float that might be adaptable for MCodePrinter. Similarly, MathMLPrinter and LatexPrinter have implementations for _print_Derivative that could be used as a reference to implement the needed functionality in MCodePrinter. Relevant code spans from these classes should be identified and possibly adapted for the MCodePrinter in the sympy/printing/mathematica.py file to address the issue.",
