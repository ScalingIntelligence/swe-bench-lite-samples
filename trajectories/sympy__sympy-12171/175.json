Given the descriptions and the provided potential relevant files, it's clear that the MCodePrinter class in 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' is the primary focus.

The issue mentions two specific problems: 1) Derivatives are not printed correctly, e.g., Derivative(f(t), t) should yield D[f[t],t] instead of Derivative(f(t), t), and 2) Floats with exponents are not handled correctly, e.g., 1.0e-4 should be converted to 1.0*^-4.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, we find several relevant code spans:\n\n1. In 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py', there is a class 'MCodePrinter' which is likely responsible for generating Mathematica code, but it lacks specific methods '_print_Derivative' and '_print_Float'. This class is a likely candidate for implementing the fixes suggested in the issue.\n2. In 'sympy/printing/latex.py', there are methods '_print_Derivative' and '_print_Float' in the 'LatexPrinter' class, but these handle LaTeX printing and are not directly relevant to Mathematica code printing.\n3. In 'sympy/printing/str.py', there are similar methods '_print_Derivative' and '_print_Float' in the 'StrPrinter' class, which handle string representations. These are also not directly relevant but provide insights into how such methods might be structured.\n4. In 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', there is a method '_print_Derivative' in the 'PrettyPrinter' class, which handles pretty-printing. This, too, is not directly relevant but offers another perspective on how derivatives might be processed.\n\nGiven these findings, the focus should be on 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py' to implement the required changes, as it is directly related to Mathematica code printing.\n\nThus, the identified relevant code spans are within the 'MCodePrinter' class in 'sympy/printing/mathematica.py'.",

I will identify the relevant code spans in the search results. For floats, the issue is about replacing 'e' with '*^', and for derivatives, it involves converting Derivative(f(t), t) to D[f[t], t]. I will review the MCodePrinter class in the sympy/printing/mathematica.py file for potential methods to modify for handling floats and derivatives. I will also ensure that the relevant methods (_print_Float and _print_Derivative) are identified for each concern.\n\n1. Initial Analysis of MCodePrinter in mathematica.py:\n- The MCodePrinter class is analyzed to determine if it has methods for handling derivatives and floats.\n- The class does not currently have methods for _print_Derivative or _print_Float, which means these methods would need to be added or existing methods could potentially be expanded upon.\n\n2. Comparison with Other Printers:\n- I reviewed the MathMLPrinter, StrPrinter, LatexPrinter, ReprPrinter, FCodePrinter, MpmathPrinter, TheanoPrinter, and PrettyPrinter to observe how they handle _print_Float and _print_Derivative.\n- This helps in understanding potential formats or adjustments needed for implementing the correct Mathematica syntax.\n\n3. Identification of Relevant Code Spans:\n- From the search results, it is clear that the MCodePrinter lacks specific methods for addressing the issues of float handling and derivative printing.\n- Therefore, the relevant code spans would involve implementing the suggested fixes within the MCodePrinter class:\n\n  def _print_Derivative(self, expr):\n      return \"D[%s]\" % (self.stringify(expr.args, \", \"))\n\n  def _print_Float(self, expr):\n      res = str(expr)\n      return res.replace('e','*^')\n\n Considering the current file context and search results, this would be the most relevant addition to effectively address the reported issue. Workflow can now be adjusted to incorporate these methods within the MCodePrinter class.",
