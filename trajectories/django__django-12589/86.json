            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves a 'GROUP BY' clause error in Django 3.0, specifically related to the 'status' field when using field annotations. The error message 'column reference \"status\" is ambiguous' indicates that the 'status' field is not being properly referenced in the 'GROUP BY' clause, leading to ambiguity. This might be due to changes in how Django 3.0 handles field references or annotations compared to previous versions. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the specific part of the code where the 'GROUP BY' clause is being constructed. The provided context already includes relevant files and methods related to SQL query compilation, expression handling, and aggregation in Django. Therefore, I will search for files and code snippets related to these contexts and focus on methods like 'set_group_by', 'get_group_by', 'add_annotation', and 'annotate', as these likely handle the 'GROUP BY' clause and field annotations.",
