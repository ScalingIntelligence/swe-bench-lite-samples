The error arises due to the 'status' column being ambiguous in the SQL query generated by Django. This issue is particularly relevant in Django's SQL compiler and query classes, where the handling of GROUP BY clauses is defined. The search results provide insights into how Django constructs and manages GROUP BY clauses within its SQLCompiler and Query classes. Specifically, the `get_group_by` method in `SQLCompiler` and the `set_group_by` method in `Query` are crucial for understanding how Django aggregates fields in the GROUP BY clause. Additionally, the `Aggregate` class and its subclasses in `django/db/models/aggregates.py` are relevant as they define how different aggregate functions (like Count, Sum, etc.) are handled, which might also contribute to the GROUP BY clause formation. These code spans are directly related to the logic that could be causing the ambiguous column reference error in the reported issue. By analyzing these methods and classes, we can gain a deeper understanding of how Django constructs SQL queries involving GROUP BY and potentially identify where adjustments are needed to resolve the ambiguity error.",
