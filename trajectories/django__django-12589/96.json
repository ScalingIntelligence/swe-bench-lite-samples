            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves a 'GROUP BY' clause error in Django 3.0 due to ambiguous column references in queries involving model relations and annotations. The primary areas of interest are the methods related to query construction, aggregation, and expression handling in Django's ORM. Specifically, focus should be on methods and classes that handle query compilation, aggregation, and the setup of joins and annotations. Given the specific error ('column reference \"status\" is ambiguous'), it's crucial to identify how 'GROUP BY' clauses are managed in the context of complex queries with multiple joins and nested subqueries. The provided context mentions several relevant files in Django's ORM codebase, particularly those dealing with query compilation, model expressions, and aggregation. Thus, the search should target methods and classes within these files that are involved in the construction and execution of SQL queries, especially those that handle grouping and annotation-related aspects. On examination of the provided context, it seems that the most relevant methods like 'set_group_by', 'add_annotation', 'get_group_by_cols', and 'build_filter', among others, should be the primary targets for this search due to their direct involvement in managing 'GROUP BY' clauses and annotations problematic in this scenario.",

The 'get_group_by_cols' method in 'django/db/models/aggregates.py' is important as it outlines how aggregates should handle group by operations, though initially it does not suggest handling of ambiguous column references. The 'get_group_by' method in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' is crucial as it constructs the actual 'GROUP BY' clause during SQL compilation, ensuring all relevant columns, including those from expressions and aggregates, are included. Given these components, I believe the main areas associated with managing 'GROUP BY' clauses, especially those dealing with ambiguities, are covered.
