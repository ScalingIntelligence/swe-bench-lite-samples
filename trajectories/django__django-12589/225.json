Other methods such as `Query.get_count`, `Query.has_filters`, `Query.has_results`, `Query.explain`, `Query.add_select_related`, and `Query.set_values` provide additional context on query manipulation, but they don't directly address the ambiguity in the `GROUP BY` clause.

It appears that if annotations are present in the query, their columns are also included in the GROUP BY clause.

However, there's a warning about the method signature of `get_group_by_cols` which implies that adjustments might be necessary for compatibility with future versions of Django.

The method deals with how Django handles GROUP BY clauses in the presence of annotations, which aligns with the described error scenario. Additionally, the context includes other related methods and classes such as `get_group_by_cols` in different classes like `Aggregate`, `BaseExpression`, `Value`, `RawSQL`, `Col`, `Ref`, and `OrderBy`, which are all pertinent to understanding how Django constructs and groups SQL columns. Although the context is quite detailed and covers a substantial part of the ORM's functioning concerning the GROUP BY clause, there is a mention of potential future compatibility issues with `get_group_by_cols` due to method signature changes. It suggests that while the provided context is relevant and covers a lot, there might be deeper levels of implementation or specific edge cases that could benefit from further inspection.
