The error message indicates that the 'status' column reference is ambiguous. This issue seems to be related to how Django handles GROUP BY clauses and possibly how it sets subqueries. To resolve this, we need to find and examine the relevant parts of the Django ORM code dealing with query annotations, GROUP BY clauses, and subqueries. Focusing on the files we have context for, particularly 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', 'django/db/models/aggregates.py', and 'django/db/models/expressions.py', should help pinpoint the exact functions and logic causing the ambiguity.",

The 'set_group_by' method could be particularly relevant, as it outlines how columns are added to the GROUP BY clause, possibly involving annotations and other expressions. Given the error of ambiguous column references, this section needs scrutiny for how column ambiguities are handled or could arise. In 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'get_group_by' method is critical as it translates the query's GROUP BY requirements into SQL. This method must ensure all columns referenced are clearly defined and non-ambiguous, especially when handling subqueries and annotations. The presence of complex logic involving resolution of references and evaluation of expressions underscores its importance in scenarios leading to the error reported. These sections will help in understanding how Django processes GROUP BY clauses, especially in the presence of annotations and subqueries, and might highlight shortcomings or areas needing adjustment to prevent the reported ambiguity error.",

The issue is about a 'GROUP BY' clause error in Django 3.0 where the 'status' column reference is ambiguous in a complex query involving models A, B, AB, and C with ManyToMany relationships. The error occurs specifically with a query that uses subquery annotations and GROUP BY clauses.\n\nStep 2: Review the current file context. The file context provided contains code spans with focus on the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. These classes handle aspects of SQL query construction and compilation, including group by clauses and annotations.\n\nStep 3: Process new search results.\n  3.1 Analyze each code span in the new search results, which again focus on `Query` and `SQLCompiler` classes.\n  3.2 Match code spans with key elements identified in the reported issue: `GROUP BY`, `annotations`, `subqueries`, and handling ambiguous column references.\n  3.3 Identify relevance: The `set_group_by` method in `Query` and `get_group_by` method in `SQLCompiler` are highly relevant as they directly deal with setting and getting group by clauses, which is central to the reported issue.\n  3.4 New functionality suggested by the issue is the proper handling of ambiguous references in GROUP BY clauses. The existing code spans show how group by is set and retrieved but do not directly address the ambiguity issue.\n  3.5 Review entire sections of code: The entire methods `set_group_by` and `get_group_by` are reviewed for completeness.\n  3.6 Verify references: No other parts of the codebase are referenced that might be relevant but not found.\n  3.7 Extract relevant code spans: Specifically, spans 'Query.set_group_by' and 'SQLCompiler.get_group_by' are relevant.\n\n4.
