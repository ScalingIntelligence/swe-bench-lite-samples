The provided context includes files and methods related to query compilation, aggregation, and expressions in Django's ORM. To resolve this issue, it's important to focus on the methods responsible for setting and managing the 'GROUP BY' clauses and how field annotations are handled, particularly in the `set_group_by` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `get_group_by` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`.

The error occurs specifically when trying to group by an annotated field, which leads to ambiguity in the SQL query. This is a known issue in Django 3.0 that changed the way annotations and aggregations are handled in queries. The provided search results contain relevant code spans that are potentially related to the handling of annotations, aggregations, and GROUP BY clauses in Django's ORM.\n\nThe 'Query' class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' includes methods like '__init__', 'get_aggregation', and 'set_group_by'. The 'get_aggregation' method is likely relevant as it deals with aggregate functions and annotations. The 'set_group_by' method is also pertinent as it directly sets the group by clause in the query. Further, the 'Count' class in 'django/db/models/aggregates.py' is relevant because it deals with the COUNT aggregate function, which is likely used in the problematic query.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'SQLCompiler' class contains the 'get_group_by' and 'collapse_group_by' methods, which are directly related to how GROUP BY clauses are constructed in the SQL compilation process. These methods could hold the key to understanding and potentially resolving the ambiguity error.\n\nGiven the context of the issue and based on the analysis of the code spans provided, the relevant files and code spans have been identified for further investigation into the cause and solution of the GROUP BY ambiguity issue in Django 3.0.",
