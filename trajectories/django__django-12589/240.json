The error message 'column reference \"status\" is ambiguous' indicates that the database query generated by Django's ORM is ambiguous in how it references the 'status' field when used in a subquery and grouped by it. Given the context, I should focus on Django's ORM internals where queries are built and aggregated data is handled. Specifically, I will search for methods and classes involved in SQL query compilation, aggregation, and expression handling to understand how 'GROUP BY' clauses are generated and managed.",

The provided context suggests that the error occurs when Django tries to generate a 'GROUP BY' clause that includes a subquery annotation, causing ambiguity in the reference to the 'status' field. By examining the methods involved in setting and processing group by clauses, such as `set_group_by` in the `Query` class and `get_group_by` and `collapse_group_by` in the `SQLCompiler` class, I can trace how this ambiguity might arise. Additionally, looking into the `get_group_by_cols` method in the `BaseExpression` class and similar methods in related classes like `Aggregate` and `Expression` will provide insight into how Django constructs the SQL expressions for grouping.",

The key sections to look at are the 'get_group_by' and 'collapse_group_by' methods in 'SQLCompiler', and the 'set_group_by' method in 'Query'. These sections deal with the generation and optimization of 'GROUP BY' clauses. I also looked at the 'add_annotation' method in 'Query' to understand how annotations are added to the query. Additionally, the 'BaseExpression.get_group_by_cols' method is relevant as it defines how expressions get their group by columns. From the provided search results, the identified code spans are relevant to the issue as they directly involve the 'GROUP BY' handling and annotation management in Django's ORM.",
