This involves the models A, B, AB, and C with various relations and the problematic query using annotations and counts. The error indicates an issue with how Django 3.0 handles group by clauses in SQL queries compared to Django 2.2. The provided files suggest looking into the methods related to query compilation, expression handling, and aggregation processing in Django's database models. Specifically, methods like 'set_group_by', 'get_group_by', 'get_aggregation', 'add_annotation', 'get_external_cols', and 'resolve_ref' in the 'query.py' file, along with related functionalities in 'aggregates.py', 'expressions.py', and 'compiler.py' should be investigated further for potential inconsistencies or changes between Django versions 2.2 and 3.0 that may explain the error.",

The error arises in the context of a complex query involving models A, B, AB, and C with many-to-many and foreign key relationships. The query uses Subquery and annotation to compute the status and count of related objects. The error specifically occurs during the grouping of the results. The provided search results include relevant code spans from Django's SQL compiler and query classes that handle the generation of SQL for database operations. The code spans include methods responsible for generating GROUP BY clauses (get_group_by, collapse_group_by), handling annotations (add_annotation, get_aggregation), and managing the query structure (set_group_by, annotation_select). These methods are crucial for understanding how Django constructs SQL queries and handles annotations, which are directly related to the issue at hand. By analyzing these methods, we can determine if they address the ambiguity error caused by field annotation in the 'GROUP BY' clause.",
