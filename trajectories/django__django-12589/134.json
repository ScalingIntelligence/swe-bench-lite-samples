The search results include the SQLCompiler class and the Query class, which are highly relevant to this issue as they handle SQL compilation and query construction in Django. Specifically, the SQLCompiler.get_group_by method and the Query.resolve_ref and Query.set_group_by methods are critical for understanding and potentially resolving this issue, as they directly involve the GROUP BY clause and resolving field references in queries.
