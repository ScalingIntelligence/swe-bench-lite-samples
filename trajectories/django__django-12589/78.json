The error message indicates ambiguity in the 'status' column reference. The issue seems to be related to how Django generates SQL queries for these relationships and how it handles group by clauses when using Subquery annotations. The provided file context lists several key files within the Django ORM that might be relevant to this issue, particularly those dealing with query compilation, expression management, and aggregation. Looking into how these components handle group by clauses and subquery annotations will be crucial.",
