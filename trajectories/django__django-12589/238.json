The error is specific to the 'status' field, which appears to be causing conflicts in the SQL query generated by Django's ORM. Focusing on the methods and classes that handle query construction, annotation, and aggregation in Django's ORM will be crucial for identifying and fixing this problem. Specifically, examining the set_group_by method in django/db/models/sql/query.py and the related aggregation and expression handling in other files such as django/db/models/aggregates.py and django/db/models/expressions.py could provide insights into how to resolve the ambiguity issue.",

This analysis involves identifying code spans in Django's query and compiler modules related to handling GROUP BY and annotations. The relevant files and code spans are identified based on their functionality in dealing with annotations and GROUP BY clauses.\n\n1. `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n   - `Query.set_group_by`: This method sets the GROUP BY clause in the query, which is directly related to the issue at hand. The method deals with grouping columns and annotations that might be causing the ambiguity.\n   - `Query.add_annotation`: Handles the addition of annotations to the query, a key part of the query that is affected by the GROUP BY issue.\n2. `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`\n   - `SQLCompiler.get_group_by`: Responsible for generating the GROUP BY SQL, a crucial part of the process in the reported issue.\n3. Additional spans in the `Query` class within `query.py` provide a deeper understanding of how annotations and columns are managed during query compilation, which could also contribute to the error.\n\nBy examining how annotations and GROUP BY clauses are managed in these methods, we can understand how Django resolves references and handles ambiguity in column references.",
