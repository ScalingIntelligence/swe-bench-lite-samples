The error message 'column reference \"status\" is ambiguous' suggests that the database is having trouble distinguishing between the different instances of 'status' in the query. To resolve this, we need to pinpoint where the ambiguity arises and how Django's query handling diverges between versions 2.2.11 and 3.0.4. We should focus on the methods and classes responsible for managing annotations, groupings, and SQL query compilation in Django's ORM. Given the context provided, we can start by examining the Query class and its methods related to grouping and annotation, such as 'set_group_by', 'add_annotation', and 'get_aggregation'. Additionally, we should look into the SQLCompiler class and its methods for managing SQL compilation with groupings.",
