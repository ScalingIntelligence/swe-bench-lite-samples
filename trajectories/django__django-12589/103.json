The provided query is causing a 'column reference \"status\" is ambiguous' error, which indicates that Django is having trouble distinguishing between different instances of the 'status' field when generating the SQL query. This issue arises because PostgreSQL considers all occurrences of the field name 'status' within the same query, making it impossible to know which instance should be grouped. The solution involves explicitly naming the fields in the 'GROUP BY' clause to ensure clarity.",

This requires adjusting the `values()` and `annotate()` methods to clearly define the source of the 'status' field. Specifically, replace the `values(\"status\")` in the `annotate()` method with an unambiguous reference, possibly through a custom annotation name. Additionally, examine the `Subquery` and `Count` methods to ensure they are not producing duplicates that could cause ambiguity."
