The key problem is that the 'status' column reference becomes ambiguous when the query is executed with a GROUP BY clause. This issue seems to have surfaced during the upgrade to Django 3.0.4 from an earlier version where the query was processed properly. The search results include various methods and classes from Django's ORM that are likely to be involved in handling GROUP BY clauses and annotations. The methods 'get_group_by' and 'collapse_group_by' in the SQLCompiler class, as well as 'set_group_by' in the Query class, are of particular interest as they directly deal with building the GROUP BY clause. Additionally, the 'annotate' method in the QuerySet class is relevant as it pertains to the field annotations that are causing the issue. These methods will need to be reviewed to understand how they construct and manage the GROUP BY clause and annotations, and how they may differ between Django versions.",
