The key focus is on the function 'check_array' in the 'validation' module of scikit-learn. I analyzed the 'check_array' function and found that it includes logic for handling the 'warn_on_dtype' parameter. The function checks the dtype of the input array and issues a warning if the dtype changes. Given the issue's description, it appears that the warning is not being triggered as expected when the input is a DataFrame. The 'check_array' function is responsible for validating arrays and parameters, and it should handle the 'warn_on_dtype' parameter correctly. The function '_shape_repr' and '_num_samples' are utility functions used within 'check_array', but they are not directly related to the 'warn_on_dtype' functionality and can be disregarded for this issue. Therefore, the relevant code span is the one defining and implementing the 'check_array' function.",
