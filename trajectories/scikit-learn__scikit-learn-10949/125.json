The expected behavior is to raise a `DataConversionWarning` when the dtype of the DataFrame changes during conversion.\n\n2. Review the current file context: No relevant files or code spans have been identified yet.\n\n3. Process new search results:\n   a. Identify the relevant code spans: The focus should be on the `check_array` function since it's the function being used in the provided code.\n   b. Analyze the `check_array` function: The function includes logic for handling different input types, dtype conversions, and warnings. Specifically, there's a segment that directly relates to the `warn_on_dtype` parameter, which checks if the original dtype differs from the new dtype and issues a warning if so. This is exactly where the issue should be investigated further.\n   c. Other code spans: Although not immediately relevant to the issue, other functions like `_num_samples` and `_shape_repr` are supporting utilities used within `check_array`, indicating a comprehensive look at the codebase is necessary to fully understand how `warn_on_dtype` interacts with DataFrame inputs.\n   d. Verify the issue's impact: Given the structure of the `check_array` function, it seems feasible to investigate why no warning is issued for DataFrame inputs, even when `warn_on_dtype` is set to True.\n   e. Consideration for further investigation: The absence of a warning could be due to how DataFrame inputs are handled internally within the `check_array` function, possibly skipping or not properly triggering the dtype warning check.\n\n4. Determine relevance and completeness: The provided `check_array` function is highly relevant as it directly handles the input DataFrame and should be responsible for issuing the warning based on the `warn_on_dtype` parameter. However, the search seems to be incomplete as there might be other parts of the code or configurations that affect how DataFrame inputs are processed that were not captured in the search results, particularly how the dtype conversion logic and the warning mechanism interact specifically with DataFrame objects.",

The current codebase already contains the relevant function 'check_array' which handles the conversion and validation of array-like objects, including DataFrames. However, upon analysis of the function, it appears that the 'warn_on_dtype' parameter is correctly implemented to issue a warning when the dtype changes, but no warning is observed when a DataFrame is provided. Given this, the relevant code spans should focus on the 'check_array' function and the specific condition where 'warn_on_dtype' is evaluated. Additionally, the 'check_X_y' function, which also calls 'check_array', should be reviewed to ensure it doesn't inadvertently cause the issue when dealing with DataFrames. The provided search results exactly match the relevant parts of the codebase identified as potentially responsible for the issue, thus confirming the relevance and completeness of the search. It is recommended to further investigate the 'check_array' function, specifically the section where dtype conversion occurs for object dtype arrays, which should correspond to the handling of DataFrames.
