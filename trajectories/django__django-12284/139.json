This can be related to how Django handles choices in fields and the display of those choices in models. The provided search results include relevant sections of the Django source code: \n1. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model` class contains the `_get_FIELD_display` method which is responsible for displaying the value of a field based on its choices. This method uses the `choices_dict` to map the field value to its corresponding display value. However, if the model inherits and overrides choices, the display mapping might not be updated correctly. The method uses the `make_hashable` function to ensure the field value can be used as a dictionary key, and it returns the display value based on this key.\n2. In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `Field` class is defined, which includes the `get_choices` method. This method retrieves the choices for a field, including handling for blank choices. Since the issue involves choices, this method might also play a role in how choices are handled, especially in inherited models where choices might be overridden.\nThese sections of code are directly relevant to the issue, as they deal with how choices are defined and displayed in Django models, which the issue is specifically about. They provide the foundational code for understanding how choices work in Django and how the display might be affected when choices are inherited and overridden.",

Additionally, the `Field.get_choices` method in `__init__.py` is also pertinent as it deals with the generation of choices for a field. The identified methods within these files suggest that the relevant code has been located and involves the handling and display of choices in model fields, particularly in the context of inherited models.
