The base model defines some choices, and a child model extends these choices. However, the `get_foo_display` method fails to correctly resolve the display values for the additional choices in the child model. Primarily, the focus should be on understanding how the `get_foo_display` method interacts with choices, particularly in the context of inheritance. Looking at the `django/db/models/base.py` file, there's a method `_get_FIELD_display` which might be related to this functionality. Additionally, since the issue involves handling of choices, it would be prudent to check the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` for methods like `get_choices` and `_get_flatchoices` as they might influence how choices are managed and displayed. Given these insights, the search should target these specific methods and their implementations to pinpoint the root cause of the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the functionality of `Model.get_FOO_display()` method when dealing with inherited choices in Django models. Specifically, the issue arises when a child model overrides the choices of a base model and adds new tuples to the choices. The `get_foo_display` method does not correctly display the values for these new tuples. Of primary interest are the methods `_get_FIELD_display` in the `Model` class and `get_choices` in the `Field` class, as they are directly involved in handling the display and retrieval of choices, respectively. \n\n1. Analyzing the user's issue, it is clear that the problem lies in how choices are being handled upon inheritance and how the display method retrieves the corresponding human-readable values.\n2. The file `django/db/models/base.py` contains the `Model` class, which importantly contains the `_get_FIELD_display` method. This method is key to understanding how the display functionality is currently implemented. It converts the field's value into a human-readable form based on the field's choices, but the method does not adapt well to changes in choices made by child models.\n3. The `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file houses the `Field` class, which includes methods like `get_choices` and `_get_flatchoices`. The `get_choices` method returns the available choices for a field, a critical part of the functionality impacted by inherited choices. The `_get_flatchoices` method is also of interest as it processes the choices into a flat list, which directly affects the `_get_FIELD_display` method.\n4. Both `_get_FIELD_display` and `get_choices` are identified as relevant code spans, as modifications or inspections in these parts of the code are likely necessary to resolve the issue of inherited choices not being displayed correctly.\n5. The search task is deemed incomplete as further analysis of how choices are inherited and updated when models extend each other might be required to fully address the issue.",
