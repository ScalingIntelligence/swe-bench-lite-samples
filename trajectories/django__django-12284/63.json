The focus should be on the method itself and how it handles choices, including inherited ones. The base model and child model are defined but the problem arises when the method is called on an instance of the child model to display a choice that was added in the child model. The method incorrectly displays the value itself instead of the expected output for the new tuples. This suggests a need to investigate how the `get_FOO_display` method processes choices, especially when they are overridden in a subclass. Additionally, considering Django's modular structure, related files in the `django/db/models` directory and possibly those handling field management and choice rendering in the Django admin or form modules could be relevant.",

This issue pertains to how Django handles choices in model fields, particularly when those fields are inherited and extended in child models. The provided search results include three relevant sections from Django's core model field definitions and admin utility functions, which are directly related to the handling and display of field choices.\n\n1. The `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file contains the `Field` class definition, which includes the `__init__` method where field choices are set, and the `get_choices` method for retrieving these choices. This is highly relevant because the issue involves how choices are defined and accessed in model fields.\n\n2. The `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` file includes the `ForeignObjectRel` class, which is also relevant but less directly related to the issue at hand. It deals with foreign key relationships and their choices, which might be indirectly related to the issue if foreign key fields are involved.\n\n3. The `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file contains the `display_for_field` function, particularly relevant for understanding how field values are displayed in the Django admin interface. This function checks for a field's choices and uses them to display values, which directly relates to the issue as it impacts how the choices are shown.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant sections of the codebase have been identified that could be causing or related to the issue with inherited choices in Django model fields. Specifically, the `Field.__init__` and `Field.get_choices` methods from the first file, and the `display_for_field` function from the last file, are the most pertinent parts of the code to investigate further for resolving the reported issue.",
