Given the base model `A` with choices, and child model `B` which inherits from `A` and adds more choices, the method fails to return the correct display value for the new choices. The search should focus on the method `_get_FIELD_display` in the `Model` class within `django/db/models/base.py`, as well as the `Field` class's handling of choices in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. Additionally, investigating the `Choices` functionality in `django/db/models/enums.py` could also be relevant.",

Specifically, the method fails to display the correct 'output3' for the new tuple 'C' added in the child model. To address this, we need to identify the relevant method that handles the display functionality in the Django source code. The search results reveal two significant files: `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. In `django/db/models/base.py`, there is a `_get_FIELD_display` method that seems to be responsible for displaying the choices. This method retrieves the value and matches it against a dictionary of choices to return the correct display value. Additionally, in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, there is a `get_choices` method used by the `Field` class to manage choices. Given the context and the functionalities provided, the `_get_FIELD_display` method in `django/db/models/base.py` is clearly the relevant code span for investigating and potentially fixing the issue with inherited choices in the `get_FOO_display()` method. Therefore, I recommend focusing on this method for a closer look.",

The issue with the new choice tuples not displaying correctly in inherited models might be related to how the choices are being handled in the child model or how they are passed to this method.

Specifically, the issue mentions that the method does not return the expected output for new tuples added in a child model's overridden choices.\n\n2. The current file context provided includes a definition of the Model class and its method _get_FIELD_display in django/db/models/base.py. This method is responsible for converting the field value to its human-readable form based on the choices provided.\n\n3. New search results show additional code concerning the Field class and its attributes, particularly focusing on choices and how they are handled. The Field class is a fundamental part of Django's model system and deals with the definition of fields in a model.\n\n4. For each code span in the new search results, I evaluated its relevance to the reported issue:\n   - The Field class's __init__ method, which initializes the field and sets attributes like choices.\n   - The Field._check_choices method, which checks the validity of the choices.\n   - The Field.get_choices method, which returns the choices for the field.\n   - The Field._get_flatchoices method and flatchoices property, which handle the flattening of choices.\n   - The Model._get_FIELD_display method in a different span within the same file, which was already identified as relevant.\n\n5. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant because they deal directly with the choices attribute of fields, which is central to the issue at hand.\n\n6. It appears that the search task can be considered complete as the identified spans cover the core aspects related to handling model field choices and their display in Django's model system.",
