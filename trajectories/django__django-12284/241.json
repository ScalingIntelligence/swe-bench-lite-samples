Specifically, the problem arises when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, leading to incorrect display values for new tuples added in the child model. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with choices and display logic in the Django model system. The search results provided show several code spans in `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. The key spans to focus on are those related to the `Model` class and its methods, particularly `_get_FIELD_display`, which is responsible for displaying field values based on choices. Additionally, examining the `Field` class and its methods like `get_choices` can provide insights into how choices are managed and retrieved.\n\n1. **Model._get_FIELD_display**: This method is directly related to the issue as it handles the display logic for field choices. Analyzing its implementation will be crucial to understand why the new tuples added in the child model do not display correctly.\n2. **Field.get_choices**: Although this method is not directly mentioned in the issue, it is relevant as it deals with retrieving choices for a field. Understanding how choices are processed in this method could provide context for the `_get_FIELD_display` method.\n\nThese spans are identified as relevant based on their direct involvement with the choices and display logic in Django models, which are central to the reported issue.",

Specifically, it notes that the method fails to correctly display the new tuples added in a child model. The provided search results include code spans from two main files: 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py'. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the relevant code span is 'Model._get_FIELD_display', which defines the method responsible for displaying the choice value. This method uses a dictionary created from the field's choices to look up and display the corresponding value. In 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', the relevant code span is 'Field.get_choices', which is responsible for generating the choices list for a field. This method is crucial for understanding how choices are handled and how the child model might override them. The current implementation of '_get_FIELD_display' directly uses the choices defined in the field, which suggests that it does not account for dynamic updates to choices in inherited models. The 'get_choices' method, on the other hand, deals with retrieving choices for display but does not seem to handle the inheritance of choices explicitly. Based on the provided context and search results, these spans are directly relevant to the reported issue and should be included in the identified spans. However, it is crucial to note that the search results do not explicitly provide the mechanism for how the child model's choices are merged with or replace those of the parent model. Further investigation may be needed to fully understand and address the issue of inherited choices not being recognized in the 'get_FOO_display' method. The provided search results do not cover the handling of choice inheritance explicitly, which might be essential for a complete solution to the issue.",

I examined `django/db/models/base.py` and found the method `_get_FIELD_display` which appears to be relevant to the issue, as it deals with displaying field values based on choices. Additionally, in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, I found the `Field` class which includes the `choices` attribute, relevant for handling the choice options. These findings appear to cover the relevant context for understanding and potentially fixing the issue described. The method `_get_FIELD_display` specifically handles the display logic of field choices, suggesting it's the likely culprit for the incorrect display observed with inherited choices. Furthermore, the `get_choices` method in the `Field` class seems to generate the choices based on the field settings, which is also relevant to the issue. These elements collectively address the problem stated in the issue.",
