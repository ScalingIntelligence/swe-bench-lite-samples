From the context provided, it seems that when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, the display method does not function as expected for the newly added choices. The `get_FOO_display()` method should ideally return the display value based on the choices defined in the child class, but it does not handle the new choices correctly. The search results reveal the implementation of the `_get_FIELD_display` method in Django's `Model` class, which is responsible for displaying the field's value based on the choices provided. This method uses a dictionary created from the field's choices to look up the display value. The issue likely arises because the method does not dynamically update the choices based on the class's current state, particularly when it comes to inherited choices. This method could be the source of the problem that the reported issue is addressing. The analysis indicates that the relevant code spans include the implementation of the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method, as it directly relates to the display functionality described in the issue.",

The provided file context and search results both point to the `django/db/models/base.py` file, which contains the implementation of the `Model` class and the `_get_FIELD_display` method. This method is likely where the issue lies, as it handles the display logic for model fields with choices. The method uses a dictionary created from the field's `flatchoices` to map the field's value to its display value. Given the issue, it seems that the method might not be properly accounting for choices inherited and overridden in child models. Therefore, the focus should be on enhancing the `_get_FIELD_display` method to ensure it can handle choices correctly, even when they are inherited and extended in child models.
