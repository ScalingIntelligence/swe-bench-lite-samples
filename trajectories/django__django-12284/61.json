Specifically, when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, the method does not display the correct values for new choices added in the child model. The search should focus on identifying the logic within Django's model field and model base classes where choice handling occurs. This includes looking into `Field` and `Model` classes and their methods related to choices and display, such as `get_choices()`, `_get_FIELD_display()`, and possibly others. Understanding how these methods handle inherited choices and potentially overriding behavior will be crucial.",

The identified code spans include the 'Model' class definition, the '__init__' method of the 'Model' class, and the '_get_FIELD_display' method.

The `Field` class initialization in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` shows that the `choices` parameter is directly set to an instance attribute. However, there's a need to delve deeper into how choices are managed during model initialization and specifically how they are updated or overridden in child models. The `class_prepared` signal might play a crucial role in this process as it indicates when a model class is ready, potentially post-inheritance. Further investigation into the `_meta` attribute handling, which contains metadata about the model and its fields, including choices, is also warranted to understand how it might be affected by inheritance and choice overrides.",
