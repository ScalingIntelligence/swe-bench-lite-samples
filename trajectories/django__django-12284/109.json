The user has provided a detailed example of a base model and a child model that inherits and overrides the choices. The problem is that the new choices added in the child model do not display correctly when using `get_FOO_display()`. After reviewing the search results, specifically the code span identified by `Model._get_FIELD_display`, it appears that this method uses the `field.flatchoices` to determine the display value. This method may need adjustments to correctly handle inherited and overridden choices as in the child model. The method `_get_FIELD_display` could be the part of the solution to fix this issue.",

Specifically, it should return the human-readable string for the value 'C' but returns 'C' itself instead. The provided code snippet reveals the implementation of the method `_get_FIELD_display` in the `Model` class, which is responsible for this functionality. This method retrieves the value of the field, builds a dictionary from the field's choices, and then returns the corresponding human-readable string. The current implementation is able to handle existing tuples correctly but fails with new tuples added in a child model. To address this issue, the relevant code span is the implementation of `_get_FIELD_display`, as it is the method directly involved in the bug.
