Specifically, new choices added in a child model are not being displayed correctly when using `get_foo_display()`. The issue suggests that the method fails to recognize new tuples added to the choices in the child model.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, the relevant code spans are found within the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py`. Specifically, the method `_get_FIELD_display` needs to be inspected and potentially modified to correctly handle inherited choices. Additionally, the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `ForeignObjectRel` class in `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` may also need adjustments to fully resolve the issue.\n\nGiven the provided context, the `_get_FIELD_display` method is identified as a key point of interest, as it directly pertains to the functionality reported in the issue. The method currently constructs a dictionary of choices and retrieves the display value based on the current field value. However, it appears not to account for choices that might be inherited or extended in child models.\n\nThe search results include definitions of `Model`, `Field`, and `ForeignObjectRel`, which are relevant to understanding and potentially solving the problem with inherited choices in Django models. The `_get_FIELD_display` method is particularly important as it directly involves the logic for displaying field values based on choices. The other spans involve the initialization and choice handling in fields, which could affect how choices are inherited and used across models.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is clear that the provided code spans cover the necessary components to address the issue with `get_foo_display()` not working correctly with inherited choices.

However, the specific issue of inherited choices not being correctly handled by `get_foo_display` requires a deeper understanding of how choices are propagated and managed in child models.

The `flatchoices` attribute is critical in determining how choices are displayed for a field. Examining the `Field` class and its subclasses, particularly in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, reveals that `flatchoices` are derived from the `choices` attribute of the field. However, it is unclear how this mechanism integrates with model inheritance to ensure that choices from parent models are correctly inherited or overridden by child models. Therefore, the next logical step is to find the exact point in the code where `flatchoices` are created or updated in the context of model inheritance. This search should be focused on methods within the `Model` class and `ModelBase` metaclass that deal with field initialization, especially those related to handling inherited fields and choices. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore how choices are considered or altered during the creation of a model class instance, which is managed by the `ModelBase` metaclass.",

The `Model` class contains the method `_get_FIELD_display`, which is crucial for displaying the human-readable value of a field with choices. Additionally, the `Field` class and its subclasses define how choices are set and managed, including the `choices` attribute and the `get_choices` method. However, the direct integration of inherited choices into these mechanisms, especially how the `flatchoices` are updated or created with respect to inherited fields, is not explicitly detailed within the provided file context. This gap suggests that more code, potentially in methods managing field initialization within the `ModelBase` metaclass or within the `Model` class itself, could offer a clearer picture of how inherited choices are handled and why the method might not work as expected in the case of new tuples added through inheritance.",
