The search results provided contain code spans from Django's `Field` class, which is relevant because this class is responsible for handling field choices. Additionally, the `ModelAdmin` and `InlineModelAdmin` classes are related to admin interface customization, which might be indirectly relevant to the issue. The `Field.__init__` method initializes the field with choices, and the `Field.get_choices` method is responsible for retrieving these choices. These methods are crucial for understanding how choices are set and retrieved in Django models. The `Field._check_choices` method is also relevant as it checks the validity of the choices provided to the field.

            "scratch_pad": "Analysis: The reported issue is regarding the `get_FOO_display()` method not working correctly with inherited choices in Django models. A base model has choices, and a child model inherits this base model but extends the choices. The `get_field_foo_display()` method works correctly for the inherited choices but not for the new choices added by the child model.\n\nCurrent File Context: The context provided shows portions of the `Field` class in Django's `models.fields` module, which is relevant because it includes the `choices` attribute and the `get_choices` method that might be involved in this bug.\n\nNew Search Results Review: The new search results provide additional context in the `Model` class from `models.base`, which includes the `_get_FIELD_display` method. This method uses the `choices` dictionary to map values to their display names, which seems directly related to the issue. Notably, the logic for `_get_FIELD_display` uses `flatchoices`, but it's not clear how `flatchoices` is populated or updated when a child model adds new choices.\n\nRelevant Code Spans Identi$Fied: Given the details of the issue and the current context, the key cod$e spans identified as relevant are those handling choice management and display value retrieval in both the `Field` and `Model` classes. Specifically:\n- `Field._check_choices`: Validates the format of choices.\n- `Field.get_choices`: Retrieves the choices for a field.\n- `Model._get_FIELD_display`: Retrieves the display value for a field's choice, which is where the problem described likely manifests.\n- `Field.flatchoices`: A property possibly involved in mapping choices to their display values.\n- `Field.get_filter_kwargs_for_object`: Possibly related if choices are tied to object attributes.\n- `Field.value_to_string`: Converts field values to string, which can be relevant for display.\n\nConclusion: The identified spans are relevant based on their involvement in choices management and display value retrieval, which aligns with the reported issue. It's likely that the problem occurs in how choices are managed or accessed in the inheritance scenario.\n\nTask Completion Justification: Since the identified code spans are relevant to the problem described and provide context crucial to understanding and potentially fixing the issue, I consider this search task complete. Further analysis or debugging would likely focus on these identified areas to pinpoint the exact cause and solution.",
