The method fails to correctly display the new choices added in the child model. Given the search results, the key section to focus on is the `_get_FIELD_display` method within the `Model` class. This method is responsible for returning the display value of a field based on its choices. The issue likely arises because the method only checks the choices defined in the base class and not the updated choices in the child class. The current implementation of `_get_FIELD_display` uses `field.flatchoices` which might not be updated with the new choices from the child class. This suggests that the method needs to be modified to consider the choices from the child class as well. Therefore, the relevant code span to address this issue is `Model._get_FIELD_display`.",

The issue specifically mentions that when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, the 'get_foo_display' method does not work correctly for the new tuples added. The provided file context includes the 'Model' class from 'django/db/models/base.py' which has the method '_get_FIELD_display'. This method retrieves the display value for a field's choice but seems to fail when new choices are added through inheritance. The search results provide additional context from 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', specifically the 'Field' class and its methods related to choices. The method 'get_choices' is particularly relevant as it defines how choices are retrieved and could potentially be the point of failure when dealing with inherited choices. Additionally, the 'flatchoices' property could also be involved in how choices are flattened and accessed. Given this information, it seems that the current context and search results provide enough information to pinpoint the issue. However, further investigation into how choices are handled during inheritance in Django models might still be necessary.",

However, the lack of relevant search results suggests that the core mechanisms for handling inherited choices might be missing or not directly reflected in the search pattern used. To address the incompleteness of the current investigation, it is recommended to broaden the search to include more specific contexts related to choice handling in inheritance scenarios. Additionally, examining how choices are managed and propagated through inheritance chains and how this affects the `_get_FIELD_display` method could be crucial.",
