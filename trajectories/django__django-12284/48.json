Specifically, it mentions that the method does not correctly handle newly added tuples in the choices of a child model, which inherits from a base model. The expected behavior is that `get_FOO_display()` should return the appropriate display value for all choices, including those added in the child model. To address this, we need to investigate the implementation of the `get_FIELD_display` method in the Django codebase and potentially other related methods that handle choices.\n\nGiven the search results, the `get_FIELD_display` method is found in django/db/models/base.py, which aligns with the issue's description. This method retrieves the value of a field and looks up its display value in a choices dictionary. The potential issue might lie in how the choices are merged or inherited in child models. The code spans in the search results include relevant sections from the `Field` class, `ForeignObjectRel`, and `Model` class, which are crucial for understanding how field choices are managed and accessed. Additionally, the `Field.get_choices` method is also relevant as it constructs the choices list for a field. Although the provided spans do not directly show the inheritance handling, they provide the necessary context to understand how choices are supposed to be managed and how they are currently accessed in the method.\n\nGiven the analysis, the relevant code spans have been identified to understand the issue. The `get_FIELD_display` method and the `get_choices` method are particularly relevant to the reported issue.",

These files contain the core logic for model instance initialization and field definition, respectively.

Specifically, when a child model inherits from a base model and adds more choices, the `get_foo_display()` method does not return the correct display value for the new choices. This issue is likely related to how the choices are being handled in the `_get_FIELD_display` method within the `Model` class. The provided search results include the `_get_FIELD_display` method in the `Model` class, which is responsible for returning the display value of a field based on its choices. The method retrieves the value of the field and maps it to a dictionary of choices. If the value is not found in the dictionary, it returns the value itself. This suggests that the issue might be due to the choices not being correctly updated or recognized when inherited by the child model. Additionally, the `Field.get_choices` method, which is used to get the choices for a field, is also included in the search results. This method is responsible for generating the choices list, and it might need to be adjusted to correctly handle inherited choices. Furthermore, the `Field.formfield` method, which is used to create the form field for a model field, is also relevant as it uses the choices from the `Field.get_choices` method.
