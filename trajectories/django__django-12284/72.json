Specifically, the issue arises when using this method on an inherited model where additional choices have been added. The search results reveal the relevant method _get_FIELD_display within the Model class, which is essential for understanding how the method handles choices and values. The method utilizes a dictionary created from field choices to map a given value to its corresponding display string. The problem described suggests that this dictionary does not correctly account for new choices added in subclasses, leading to the reported issue where the method fails to return the expected display value for new choices. The search results provide the necessary context to understand the implementation of _get_FIELD_display, which is crucial for addressing the issue at hand.",
