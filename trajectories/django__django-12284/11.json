The problem specifically occurs when a child model extends the choices of a base model. The method correctly handles the original choices but fails to return the expected output for the new choices added in the child model. Looking through the relevant files, the method `_get_FIELD_display` in the `Model` class seems most pertinent to this issue. Additionally, the `get_choices` method in the `Field` class might also be involved in how choices are handled. The files `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` are the initial targets for investigating this issue. It is also prudent to check how choices are handled in the `ModelChoiceField` and `ModelAdmin` classes, as they might provide insights into how choices should be managed in model inheritance scenarios.",

In particular, the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method is the one responsible for handling the display of field choices. This method retrieves the value of the field and matches it against the choices available in the field's flatchoices.

Secondly, we should investigate the `get_choices` method in the `Field` class to ensure that when choices are retrieved, they correctly include those from inherited models.

Specifically, the method does not work as expected for new tuples added in child models. From the file context, the relevant code span is identified within django/db/models/base.py, specifically in the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method. This method is responsible for returning the display value associated with the field's choices. The method uses the `choices_dict` which is a dictionary created from the field's `flatchoices`. If the value is not found in `choices_dict`, it returns the value itself, which is the issue reported as it fails to return the expected 'output3' for value 'C'. Additional relevant code spans are identified in django/db/models/options.py and django/db/models/fields/__init__.py. In django/db/models/options.py, `Options.concrete_fields` and `Options.local_concrete_fields` are found which are key for understanding the fields structure and how they are managed within Django's ORM. Additionally, django/db/models/fields/__init__.py's `Field` and `Field.get_choices` are relevant as they define how choices are set and retrieved for fields. These sections provide a deeper understanding of how choices interact with fields and models, which is crucial to address the reported issue.",
