The example demonstrates that while the method works correctly for the choices defined in the base model, it fails to correctly handle new choices added in the child model. \n\nReviewing the search results, the key areas of interest are:\n1. The `Model._get_FIELD_display` method in `django/db/models/base.py`, which is responsible for displaying the choice values.\n2. The `Field.__init__` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, which initializes the field properties including choices.\n3. The `Field.get_choices` method, also in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, which retrieves the choices for a field. \n\nConsidering the issue, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the choices and their display in the context of model inheritance. The key spans to focus on are the `Model._get_FIELD_display` and `Field.get_choices` methods, as they directly deal with how choices are managed and displayed in Django models. The `Field.__init__` method is also relevant as it sets up the choices initially.\n\nThese selected sections of code should provide enough context to understand and potentially address the issue of inherited choices not being displayed correctly by the `get_foo_display` method.",

Specifically, for new tuples added in the child model, the method returns the value itself rather than the corresponding display value. This issue involves understanding how Django models handle field choices and how the `_get_FIELD_display` method processes these choices. The code spans provided in the search results include critical sections of the Django Model class and Field class, particularly the `_get_FIELD_display` method and the `Field.get_choices` method. These spans are crucial for understanding how choices are managed and displayed in Django models. The analysis of these spans shows that the current implementation of `_get_FIELD_display` relies on the choices set in the field at the time of instantiation. If choices are overridden in a child class, the method might not correctly fetch the new choices, leading to the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those related to how choices are fetched and processed in the model and field classes.",
