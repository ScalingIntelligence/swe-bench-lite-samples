            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the `get_foo_display()` method not functioning correctly with inherited choices in Django models. The specific problem occurs when a subclass model adds new choices to a field that is inherited from a base model. The `get_foo_display()` method fails to correctly display the human-readable value for these new choices.\n\nIn the provided context, the relevant code spans are found in the `Field` class within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. This class contains the `get_choices()` method, which is crucial for handling choices in model fields. Specifically, the `get_choices()` method iterates over the choices provided to the field and prepares them for display. This method needs to be examined and potentially modified to ensure it correctly handles choices inherited by subclasses.\n\nBased on the issue description, the main concern is how inherited choices are processed and displayed in the context of model inheritance. The current logic in `get_choices()` might not account for dynamically updated choices from subclass models, leading to the issue experienced where new choices are not recognized correctly by `get_foo_display()`. This suggests a need to review and possibly revise the choice handling within the `Field` class to better support inherited choices.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans of code are `Field.__init__` where choices are initialized and `Field.get_choices` where the choices are processed for display. These are critical sections for addressing the issue by ensuring that inherited choices, including those added by subclasses, are correctly recognized and handled by the method.\n\nThe search task can be considered complete based on the identification of these key sections in the codebase. Further development and testing will be required to fully resolve the reported issue, ensuring that all relevant choices are accurately displayed in inherited models.",

To address this, we need to ensure that the `Field.get_choices()` method in the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file correctly handles the choices from the child model, including the new tuples added. The change should be made in the `get_choices()` method to ensure it checks the child model's choices before falling back to the base model's choices.

It incorrectly combines choices in a way that could lead to unexpected behavior, particularly with inheritance and choice overrides. We need to ensure that the `get_choices()` method correctly aggregates choices from base and child models, without unnecessary changes that could disrupt this process. To solve the issue concerning the `get_foo_display()` method not properly handling new tuples added by inherited choices, we need to modify `Field.get_choices()` to check for child model choices explicitly when building the choices list. This will ensure that new tuples added in the child model are correctly mapped by `get_foo_display()`, thus resolving the issue.",

This update will ensure that when `get_foo_display()` is called on a child model instance, it correctly maps the new choices added in the child model."
