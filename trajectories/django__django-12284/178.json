The problem specifically occurs with the choices added in the child class. To resolve this, it's necessary to investigate how Django handles choices in inherited models. I should focus on the `Field` class and methods such as `get_choices` and `_get_flatchoices`, as well as the `Model` class and its `_get_FIELD_display` method. Additionally, since the issue involves choices, it would be prudent to look into how Django handles choices in the `Choices` class within the `enums.py` file. The `ModelAdmin` and `ForeignKey` classes might also be relevant due to their handling of display logic and model relations.",
