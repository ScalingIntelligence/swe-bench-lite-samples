The problem is that the method does not correctly display the custom choices added in the child model, returning the actual value ('C') instead of the expected display value ('output3').\n\nReviewing the provided search results, the most relevant code spans are found in 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py'. The '_get_FIELD_display' method definition in 'django/db/models/base.py' is particularly important as it directly relates to how Django handles the retrieval of display values for model fields. This method uses the field's 'flatchoices' attribute to map values to their display strings, which might not be updated correctly when choices are overridden in child models. Additionally, the 'Field' class initialization in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' and its 'get_choices' method are relevant as they deal with how field choices are set and managed. These sections of code will be crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue with inherited choices.\n\nThus, the identified code spans include the initialization of the 'Field' class and the method handling the display of field values in 'django/db/models/base.py'. Further analysis of how choices are managed in the 'Field' class and how they propagate through inheritance would be necessary to fully address the reported issue.",

Potential issues could include a mismatch between the choices defined in the base and child classes, or a flaw in the logic that sets or retrieves these choices. The provided context suggests that while the method '_get_FIELD_display' attempts to retrieve the choices using a dictionary ('choices_dict'), it might not be correctly updated or populated when new choices are added in a subclass. This could lead to incorrect display values, as observed in the issue description. It is recommended to delve deeper into these methods to identify where the logic might be failing in the inheritance model, and to verify if the choices from the child class are being accurately considered in the display method.",

Specifically, when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, the method fails to correctly display the choices for the new tuples added in the child model.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified in the search results primarily focus on the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` and the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. These sections include the implementation of the `_get_FIELD_display` method in the `Model` class and the initialization of the `Field` class, which is crucial for understanding how choices are set and accessed.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis of the code spans reveals that there are potential issues in how choices are handled during inheritance and how the `_get_FIELD_display` method retrieves and displays these choices. The method uses a dictionary to map choices to their display values, but it might not be correctly updated or accessed when dealing with inherited choices.\n\nGiven these observations, it is clear that the provided search results contain the relevant code spans necessary to address the reported issue, particularly within the `Model` and `Field` classes. These spans will be crucial for understanding the current implementation and for making the necessary modifications to fix the issue with inherited choices in `get_foo_display`.",

Specifically, the issue arises when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides choices, resulting in the `get_foo_display()` method not displaying the expected output for new choices added by the child model.\n\nFrom the provided file context, the method `_get_FIELD_display` in `django/db/models/base.py` is identified as the potential source of the problem. This method uses `getattr(self, field.attname)` to retrieve the value of the field and then uses a dictionary created from `field.flatchoices` to determine the display value. If the value is not found in the dictionary, the original value is returned.\n\nThis behavior implies that the method might not be taking into account the child model's overridden choices. The search results confirm the presence of this method in `django/db/models/base.py`, emphasizing its relevance to the issue at hand.\n\nAdditionally, the `get_choices` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` is also relevant as it is responsible for retrieving the choices of a field, which might need to be considered when a child model overrides the choices.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans in the file context and the search results contain the code likely involved in resolving the issue. It appears that the search task is complete as the relevant code spans have been identified.",
