Specifically, when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides choice fields, it seems that the display method does not adjust accordingly for new choices added in the child model. To address this, we should first look into the implementation and logic of `get_FIELD_display` in the Model class within `django/db/models/base.py`. Additionally, we should check how the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` handles choices, especially the `get_choices` method, as choices are managed at the field level. Lastly, understanding how inheritance and overridden fields are managed in the `ModelBase` metaclass in `django/db/models/base.py` is crucial.",

This method retrieves the value of the field, constructs a dictionary of choices, and returns the force_str result of the lookup in the choices dictionary. This method is directly related to the functionality that is not working as expected in the issue report.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', the 'Field' class is found, which contains the 'choices' attribute and the 'get_choices' method. The 'choices' attribute is where the tuples of choices for a field are set. The 'get_choices' method generates a list of valid choices for the field, which is closely related to the issue since the problem occurs with displaying the choices correctly in the inherited models.\n\nGiven the context of the reported issue, these code spans are highly relevant as they directly pertain to the method and attributes involved in the choice management and display functionality of Django models.
