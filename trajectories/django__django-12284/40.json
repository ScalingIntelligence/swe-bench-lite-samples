The issue specifically focuses on how the method fails to return the expected display value for new choices added in a child model that inherits from a base model. The provided search results include relevant code spans from both django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/fields/__init__.py. In django/db/models/base.py, the critical section is 'Model._get_FIELD_display', which directly implements the behavior for displaying field values based on choices. This method retrieves the current value of the field, constructs a dictionary from field choices, and returns the display value corresponding to the current value. The analysis of this method and its context is essential to understand why the expected display value for new choices might not be returned. In django/db/models/fields/__init__.py, the 'Field.get_choices' method is relevant as it provides choices for fields, and understanding how choices are retrieved can help pinpoint the issue related to inherited choices. From an in-depth analysis, the identified relevant code spans directly address the reported issue by delving into the inner workings of Django's model system concerning field choices and their display values.
