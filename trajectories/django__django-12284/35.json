The problem arises when a child model overrides choices from a base model and adds new tuples. The method fails to display the correct output for the newly added tuples.

Specifically, the method fails to return the expected output for new tuples added in a child model that inherits from a base model. The relevant parts of the problem are the inheritance of choices and the behavior of the `get_field_foo_display()` method. Upon examining the search results, two key spans seem relevant: 'Model._get_FIELD_display' in `django/db/models/base.py` and 'Field.get_choices' in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. These spans involve the implementation of the method that retrieves choice display values and the method that generates choices for fields, respectively. These are directly related to the reported issue as they address how Django handles model fields and their choices, especially in the context of inheritance. The `_get_FIELD_display` method uses a dictionary created from the field's choices to map a value to its display string, without considering any overridden choices in the child model. This likely leads to the issue where new choices in the child model are not correctly handled. The `get_choices` method is a candidate for further investigation, as it might influence how choices are generated and thus affect the display of inherited choices.",

This method is responsible for displaying the human-readable value of a field based on its choices. The method uses the field's `flatchoices` to map and return the appropriate display value. The context also includes the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, which defines the `choices` attribute and the `get_choices` method, relevant for how choices are set and retrieved in Django fields.
