The primary suspect is the method `_get_FIELD_display()` in the `Model` class. This method likely needs to be inspected and possibly adjusted to handle inherited choice fields correctly. Additionally, the implementation of the `get_choices` method might also be a point of interest, as it could affect how the choices are processed and displayed in methods like `_get_FIELD_display`.

The example provided shows a base model with a field having choices and a child model that inherits the base model and overrides the choices, adding new tuples. However, the `get_FOO_display()` method does not work for the new tuples added in the child model.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, the most relevant parts are:\n\n1. The `Field.__init__` method where the field's `choices` property is set. This is crucial because the issue involves how choices are handled in fields.\n\n2. The `Field.get_choices` method which is responsible for getting the choices for a field. Understanding how choices are retrieved could help in diagnosing why new choices are not recognized.\n\n3. The `Field._get_flatchoices` method which flattens the choices. This could be relevant in understanding how the choices are processed.\n\n4. The `Model._get_FIELD_display` method which is directly related to the issue. This method retrieves the display value for a field's current value from its choices. The issue implies that this method does not handle the new choices added in the child model correctly.\n\nThese code spans seem relevant and should be identified as they directly deal with the choices and display handling, which are the core of the reported issue.",
