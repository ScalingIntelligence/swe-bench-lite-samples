Specifically, when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides choices, the method does not correctly display the new choices added by the child model. The search results provide insight into the Django Model class, particularly the _get_FIELD_display method. This method is responsible for displaying the human-readable value of a field based on its choices. The method retrieves the value of the field, constructs a dictionary of choices, and attempts to return the human-readable string corresponding to the field's value. The issue likely arises because the method only considers the choices defined in the base model, not those potentially overridden or added in the child model. The _get_FIELD_display method is therefore identified as relevant to the reported issue as it directly relates to the functionality of displaying field choices, which is the subject of the issue. The method from the search results should be inspected further to determine if the problem lies in how it handles inherited and overridden choices.",
