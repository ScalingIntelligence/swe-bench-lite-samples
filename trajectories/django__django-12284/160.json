The function is expected to return the human-readable form of the choice for the field. It seems to work for the choices defined in the base model but fails for new choices added in the child model. A detailed analysis of the methods involved in handling choices and their display in Django's ORM, particularly focusing on how choices are inherited and displayed, is needed. Potential candidates for investigation include the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, where methods like `get_choices` and `_get_flatchoices` might hold clues, and the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py`, where `_get_FIELD_display` method is defined. Additionally, considering the child model's handling of inherited fields and choices in the context of model inheritance might also be crucial. Enumeration handling in `django/db/models/enums.py` could also be relevant, especially with classes like `ChoicesMeta` and `Choices`.",

The example provided shows a base model `A` with choices, and a child model `B` that inherits from `A` and extends the choices. The problem occurs when invoking `get_field_foo_display()` on an instance of `B`, it does not return the expected output for the new choices added in `B`. Key aspects to focus on are how choices are handled in the `Field` class, particularly the `get_choices` and `_get_flatchoices` methods. These methods are crucial for processing choices and could be where the issue originates. Additionally, the `Model` class's `_get_FIELD_display` method is directly relevant as it retrieves and displays the choice value, which is where the discrepancy arises.\n\nIn the identified code spans, `Field.__init__` initializes the field with choices, and `Field.get_choices` processes these choices. `Field._get_flatchoices` also handles flattening choices, which could be relevant if the issue involves how choices are represented. These methods are in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. The `Model._get_FIELD_display` method in `django/db/models/base.py` directly relates to the display issue described. It uses `field.flatchoices` to map the field value to its display value, which if not correctly inherited, could lead to the problem.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the relevant code spans are indeed related to the reported issue and should be further investigated to determine if they accurately capture the problem.",

Specifically, it is mentioned that when a child model inherits a base model and overrides the choices, `get_foo_display` does not work correctly for the new tuples added.\n\n2. Review Current Context: The provided file context contains relevant code spans from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`. Notably, the `Field.__init__` method is where the choices for a field are set, and the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method is responsible for displaying the field value based on its choices.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n  3.1. Analyzed each code span in the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file. This file contains the `Field` class definition and its methods. The `Field.__init__` method initializes the field's choices, and the `Field.get_choices` method is relevant for retrieving these choices.\n  3.2. Analyzed the `ForeignObjectRel` class in `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`. This class is related to reverse relationships in Django models, but it doesn't directly address the issue of inherited choices.\n  3.3. Identified the `Field.get_choices` method as relevant to the issue, as it retrieves the field's choices. This method will be useful for understanding how choices are processed and potentially where the issue with inherited choices arises.\n  3.4. No new functions or classes were suggested by the issue, but understanding how choices are handled in the `Field` class is crucial for implementing the new functionality.\n  3.5. Reviewed entire sections of code to ensure a complete understanding. The key sections are `Field.__init__`, `Field.get_choices`, and `Model._get_FIELD_display`.\n  3.6. Verified that there are no explicit references to other parts of the codebase that might be relevant.\n  3.7. Extracted relevant code spans based on the reported issue. The relevant spans are those dealing with the initialization and retrieval of choices.\n\n4.

Specifically, the Field's '__init__' method initializes the choices attribute, and the 'get_choices' method is used to process these choices, including the handling of inherited choices from a base model. The 'Model' class also includes the '_get_FIELD_display' method which is responsible for displaying the human-readable form of the field's value based on these choices. This suggests that the file context does provide a basis for addressing the issue related to choices inheritance in model fields. However, the exact implementation of how these choices are overridden in child models, and how these changes are then handled in the '_get_FIELD_display' method, specifically with regards to the overriding of choices in child models, is not fully covered in the provided context. It seems relevant to further investigate how choices are updated or altered in child models and how these altered or added choices are then managed or represented in the methods that handle these choices in the Model class.",

The `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` is where the `choices` attribute is initialized and processed. The method `get_choices` is responsible for processing these choices, and `_get_flatchoices` flattens these choices. In the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py`, the `_get_FIELD_display` method is used to display the human-readable form of the field's value based on the choices. To fully understand the issue, we should look into more detail about how child models override choices and how this affects the display method.

The key elements to look for are: methods handling choices such as `get_choices` and `_get_flatchoices` in the Field class, and the method `_get_FIELD_display` in the Model class. Additionally, I should examine how choices are set and inherited in the Field's initialization and how they are accessed through the Model's display method. From the search results, the files `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/models/base.py` are particularly relevant as they contain definitions for Field and Model, including the relevant methods mentioned above. Furthermore, the examination of choices and their inheritance should be done in the context of initialization in the Field class and the display method in the Model class to understand how choices are processed and presented.",
