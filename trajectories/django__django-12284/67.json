The problem is specifically related to the method's inability to correctly display values for new choices introduced in a subclass. To address this, it's necessary to investigate the implementation of the get_FOO_display method as well as how choices are managed and inherited in Django models. Key files to focus on would be those dealing with model fields, model base classes, and choice management. Given the files provided in the context, it's clear that the majority of these functionalities are spread across multiple files, necessitating a detailed search. Pay particular attention to methods such as get_choices() and the logic defining how choices are inherited and accessed in subclasses.",

The example given involves a base model A with choices and a child model B that inherits from A and adds more choices. The problem is that get_foo_display() does not correctly handle the new choices added in the child model. Upon analysis of the search results, it is evident that the relevant code span is located within the _get_FIELD_display method of the django/db/models/base.py file. This method is responsible for displaying the field value based on the choices provided. The method uses a dictionary derived from field.flatchoices to map the field value to its display value. Since the choices in the child model are not correctly reflected in this method, this is likely the cause of the issue.

Therefore, this method might not correctly handle new choices added in subclasses, which aligns with the reported issue.

Specifically, the method `_get_FIELD_display` in the `Model` class and the `Field` class's `get_choices` method seem critical for understanding and potentially resolving the issue. The `Field` class's `__init__` method involves how choices are initialized, which might also be relevant to the problem at hand. Additionally, seeing the `Field._check_choices` method could help in understanding how choices are validated, though it's not directly related to the issue of displaying choices in inherited models.\n\nMoreover, the `Model._do_insert` and `Model.delete` methods, while not directly related to displaying choices, show typical operations involving models, which could indirectly affect how choices are handled or inherited. Lastly, the `ManyToManyField.save_form_data` method in `related.py` and `FileField.save_form_data` in `files.py` are likely not relevant to this specific issue, as they deal with different aspects of model data handling.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of `Model.get_FOO_display()` with inherited choices in Django models. Specifically, it appears that when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides its choices, the `get_foo_display()` method does not correctly handle the new choices added by the child model. This problem becomes evident when calling `get_field_foo_display()` on an instance of the child model. For inherited choices, the method works as expected, but for new choices added in the child model, it fails to return the human-readable form of the choice and instead returns the choice value itself.\n\nThe relevant code to address this issue involves the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method in `django/db/models/base.py`, which is responsible for converting field values into their human-readable forms based on the choices defined for the field. The `Field.get_choices` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` is also relevant as it deals with the generation of choices for fields. Additionally, the `Field._check_choices` method and the `ForeignObjectRel.get_choices` method are included as they provide a deeper understanding of how choices are handled and validated in Django models, although they might not directly contribute to the solution of this specific issue.\n\nGiven the scope of the issue and the extent of the provided search results, it is possible that further code examination or testing might be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of the problem and devise an appropriate fix. However, for the purposes of this task, the identified code spans are sufficiently relevant to proceed with the assumption that they will help in addressing the reported issue.",
