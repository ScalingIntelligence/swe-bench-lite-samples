The problem occurs when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices for a particular field. The method fails to correctly display the expected output for new choices added in the child model. To address this, we need to focus on the `django/db/models/base.py` file where the `Model` class is defined, specifically on the `_get_FIELD_display` method. Additionally, the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file should be examined for the `Field` class and its related methods handling choices.",

The key point is that when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, the method fails to return the correct display value for the new choices. This suggests that the bug could be in the way the choices are being processed in the get_foo_display method within the Model class. Since there is no relevant code identified yet in the file context, it's essential to focus on locating the parts of the codebase that deal with choice processing. The search results include some relevant code spans within the Model class in the django/db/models/base.py file. Specifically, the _get_FIELD_display method seems to be directly related to the issue. In this method, the current implementation of displaying choices seems to be dict(make_hashable(field.flatchoices)), which suggests it uses a dictionary created from the flattened choices. If the inherited choices are not properly flattened or registered in this dictionary, it could lead to the reported issue. Additionally, the Field class in the django/db/models/fields/__init__.py file also has some relevant code, particularly the get_choices and _get_flatchoices methods. These methods are responsible for preparing and flattening the choices, which could impact the display behavior. Overall, these two sections of the codebase are critical for understanding and potentially resolving the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the functionality of `Model.get_FOO_display()` when dealing with inherited choices in Django models. The specific problem is that when a child model inherits choices from a base model and adds new choices, the `get_foo_display` method does not return the expected display value for the newly added choices. The example provided shows that the method works correctly for the inherited choices but fails for the new ones.\n\nFrom the provided search results, there are several relevant code spans that could be associated with the issue:\n1. `Model._get_FIELD_display`: This method is directly responsible for returning the display value of a field, which is exactly the method that the reported issue is concerned with.\n2. `Field.__init__`: This method initializes the field with various parameters including `choices`, which might influence how `get_foo_display` works.\n3. `Field.get_choices`: This method retrieves the choices for the field, which could be indirectly related to the issue if the choices set are not properly handled.\n4. `Field.flatchoices`: This property flattens the choices which could be related to how choices are processed in the display method.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that the method `Model._get_FIELD_display` and potentially the related field initialization and choices processing methods in the `Field` class are the most relevant to the reported issue. This should provide a good starting point for further investigation or potential fixes regarding the inheritance of choices and their display values in Django models.",
