Specifically, when a child model inherits from a base model and adds more choices, `get_FOO_display()` does not correctly map the new choices to their corresponding display values. This issue could be rooted in how Django handles field choices and their inheritance. Looking at the model definition, the focus should primarily be on the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` where choices are managed and the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` where the `_get_FIELD_display` method is likely implemented. Since we have the relevant stack trace pointing to issues in these methods, it's important to examine the methods that handle the display logic for fields and the way field choices are managed and updated in the context of inheritance.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue centers on the incorrect behavior of the method `get_FOO_display()` when dealing with inherited choices in Django models. Specifically, the method fails to correctly display the new choices added in a subclass. The relevant part of the issue is that the method works for the original choices but not for the new ones added in the subclass.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided `search_results`, there are several spans of code that are likely relevant to this issue. The `Model` class definition and its `__init__` method are foundational to understanding model creation and attribute setting. The `_do_insert` and `delete` methods might be less relevant unless they interact with the choices directly.\n\nMost crucially, the span `Model._get_FIELD_display` appears to directly address the method in question. This method takes a field and retrieves its display value based on the choices provided. The method uses `getattr` to fetch the field's value, constructs a dictionary from the field's choices, and then looks up the value to find its corresponding display text. If the value isn't found in the choices, it defaults to returning the value itself.\n\nThis behavior aligns with the issue: for the new choices not present in the original set, the method likely returns the value (like 'C') instead of the expected display text ('output3'). This suggests that the issue could arise from how choices are being inherited and overridden in subclasses, and how the `_get_FIELD_display` method processes these. Identifying this span as relevant to the reported issue is crucial for further debugging or implementing a fix.\n\nGiven the focus of the reported issue, the relevant code spans are those involving the `Model` class's initialization and the method responsible for rendering the display value of fields based on their choices.",

This method is directly related to the `get_FOO_display()` functionality described in the issue.

This method is crucial for resolving the issue with inherited choices not displaying correctly. The presence of this method in the file context indicates that the relevant code for investigating the issue is present. However, the method's implementation assumes that the choices are directly set on the field and does not explicitly handle how inherited choices are managed or updated.

The method is supposed to return the human-readable name of a field's value based on the field's 'choices' attribute, but it fails to do so for new tuples added in child models that override the choices of the base model.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans:\n\n1. django/db/models/base.py - The 'Model._get_FIELD_display' method is the primary focus as it is responsible for displaying the field's value based on its choices. The method retrieves the attribute value and uses the field's 'flatchoices' to find and return the corresponding human-readable value. However, it does not handle inheritance of choices properly.\n\n2. django/db/models/fields/__init__.py - The 'Field.get_choices' method is relevant as it deals with choices and is used by '_get_FIELD_display'. However, it does not account for inherited choices in child models.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the issue, but they do not fully address the problem of inherited choices not being correctly handled in child models. The search task is not complete as there may be other parts of the codebase that deal with inheritance and choice propagation which are not covered in the provided search results.",

Specifically, the issue arises when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, causing `get_FIELD_display()` to not work correctly for the new choices added in the child model. The relevant code sections for this issue are primarily in the `Model` class and the `Field` class, particularly methods related to choices and field display.\n\nFrom the provided file context, the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method is already identified, which is crucial for understanding how the display value is computed. It uses the `choices_dict` to map the field value to its display string. The new search results confirm the presence of the `Field.get_choices` method, which is responsible for generating the choices list that `_get_FIELD_display` relies on. This method needs to be examined to ensure it correctly handles inherited choices.\n\nTo address the issue, it is necessary to understand how choices are inherited and overridden in child models and ensure that the `_get_FIELD_display` method accurately reflects the choices defined in the child model. The current implementation of `_get_FIELD_display` does not seem to account for potential overrides of choices in subclasses, which explains the reported problem.",

The method currently retrieves the choices directly from the field without considering overridden choices in child models.
