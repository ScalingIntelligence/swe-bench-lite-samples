            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the incorrect behavior of the `Model.get_FOO_display()` method when dealing with inherited choices in Django models. Specifically, when a child model inherits choices from a base model and adds new tuples to these choices, the `get_foo_display` method does not work correctly for these new tuples.\n\nThe search results provided include two key files: `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model` class is defined, which contains the `_get_FIELD_display` method, which is likely responsible for generating the display value for fields with choices. This method retrieves the field's current value and looks up the corresponding display value from a dictionary of choices.\n\nIn `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `Field` class is defined, which includes the `__init__` method where the `choices` attribute for a field is set. This attribute is a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a value and its corresponding display value.\n\nWhile the provided search results do not directly address the issue of choice inheritance and the specific problem with new tuples not being correctly handled by `_get_FIELD_display`, they do highlight the core mechanisms involved in how choices are defined and how the display value is retrieved. Specifically, the `_get_FIELD_display` method uses a dictionary to map field values to their display values, which suggests that the method's functionality might not be accounting for the way choices are overridden and extended in inherited models.\n\nGiven the scope of the reported issue and the limitations of the search results, it is important to note that while the provided code spans offer insights into how choices are handled in Django's model system, they do not directly offer a solution to the problem described in the issue. Therefore, the search task for this specific issue is not complete based on the current findings, as relevant code dealing with choice inheritance and dynamic handling of new choices in subclasses is not yet identified.",
