The issue is that the method does not correctly handle new choices added in a child model. I need to identify the relevant code spans that could be related to this behavior. The `Model._get_FIELD_display` method in `django/db/models/base.py` is crucial as it directly relates to displaying the field choices. Additionally, the `Field.__init__` and `Field.get_choices` methods in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` are relevant as they handle the initialization and fetching of choices for a field, which might be impacted by inherited choices.\n\nI have identified the relevant code spans that could be causing the issue based on the description provided. The `Model._get_FIELD_display` method is responsible for displaying the field's choices, and it directly uses the `field.flatchoices` which should include all inherited choices. The `Field.__init__` method initializes the field with its choices, and `Field.get_choices` retrieves these choices, potentially including those from the parent model but handling inheritance might need a deeper look.\n\nI have not found specific code spans addressing the issue directly, but the identified methods are where modifications could be made to fix the behavior described and could be used to implement new functionality as suggested in the issue report.",
