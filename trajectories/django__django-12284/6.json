Processed new search results:\n   - Identified relevant code spans in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, specifically `Field.get_choices` and `Field._get_flatchoices`. These spans seem relevant to how choices are handled and converted into flat choices.\n   - Considered additional sections in `django/db/models/base.py` such as `Model._get_FIELD_display` to ensure all relevant code is captured.\n   - Reviewed `django/db/models/enums.py`.

Additionally, the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, which includes the handling of choices, is also present. These pieces of code suggest that the relevant classes and methods for handling model fields and their choices are provided, implying that the file context is, to some extent, relevant to addressing the issue.
