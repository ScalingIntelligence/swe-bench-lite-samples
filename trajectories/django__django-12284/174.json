The problematic scenario involves a child model that overrides choices from a base model but encounters issues when using `get_FOO_display()` for the new choices added in the child model. The core issue lies in the display method not correctly handling the new choices. The provided code spans contain essential methods such as `Model.get_FIELD_display()`, which is central to the reported issue. This method uses a dictionary lookup paradigm to return the display value of a field based on its choices. However, the issue likely arises from the handling of inherited and overridden choices, which the code as presented does not explicitly address. Given the codebase provided, I have identified the relevant code span that directly correlates with the method in question, specifically `Model._get_FIELD_display()`, found within the `django/db/models/base.py` file. Additionally, the `Field.get_choices()` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` might also be of interest as it prepares the choices for the field, potentially influencing the display method's behavior. From the provided context, these snippets appear relevant to further understand and potentially fix the issue reported.",

There are several key points to consider: 1. The base model has a field with choices. 2. The child model inherits the base model and overrides the choices, adding new tuples. 3. The get_FIELD_display method does not return the expected output for the new tuples added in the child model.\n\nThe search results provide insights into the Django model implementation, specifically focusing on the `Model` class and the `Field` class. The relevant code spans include:\n\n1. `Model._get_FIELD_display`: This method is directly related to the issue as it handles the display of field values based on the choices. This method uses the `choices_dict` to map the field value to its display value, but it seems to fail for new choices added in the child model. This is likely the main area to investigate for the issue.\n\n2. `Field.__init__`: This method initializes the Field instance, including the setting of choices. This is relevant because it shows how choices are set during the initialization of a field. Even though it does not directly cause the issue, understanding how choices are set can be helpful when debugging the issue.\n\n3. `Field.get_choices`: This method retrieves the choices for a field. It is relevant because it shows how choices are retrieved and processed, which could be another point to investigate if the issue persists after examining `_get_FIELD_display`.\n\nGiven these points, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue reported.",

The analysis of the code provided in the search results shows that the issue likely lies in how the choices are being handled when an inherited model attempts to override them. The method _get_FIELD_display is responsible for returning the human-readable value based on the choices provided, but it uses field.flatchoices which might not be updated to reflect changes made in the child model. This discrepancy needs to be addressed to ensure that the method correctly reflects the choices defined in the child model.
