            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it appears that the method `get_FOO_display()` is not functioning as expected when dealing with inherited choices in Django models. Specifically, the issue arises when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices. The method works correctly for the original choices but fails for the new ones added by the child model. This suggests that the method `_get_FIELD_display` in the `Model` class might not be handling the inherited choices correctly.\n\nReviewing the search results, there are two relevant code spans that could be related to the issue: 1) the `_get_FIELD_display` method in the `Model` class, which is responsible for returning the display value of a field based on its choices, and 2) the `Field` class initializer and its `get_choices` method, which deal with field choices. The `_get_FIELD_display` method iterates over the field's choices to find a match to the field's value and returns the corresponding display value. If the choices were inherited and modified, this method might not correctly account for the expanded choices in the child model. The `get_choices` method is also relevant as it constructs the choices list that `_get_FIELD_display` uses, and it does so by checking the field's choices. If the method does not correctly reflect the inherited choices, it could be the root of the issue.\n\nGiven these observations, the relevant code spans are the `_get_FIELD_display` method within the `Model` class and the `get_choices` method within the `Field` class. These spans should be examined for potential bugs or areas where they do not correctly handle inherited choices.",
