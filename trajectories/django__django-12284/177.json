Specifically, when a child model inherits from a base model and adds new choices, the get_field_foo_display() method fails to return the expected output for the new choices added in the child model. The search results provided cover several aspects of the Model class in Django's ORM, including initialization, deletion, and a method related to field display. However, the most relevant code span is `Model._get_FIELD_display`, which is responsible for displaying the value of a field based on the choices provided. This method uses the field's choices to find the display value, and it seems to be the part that might not be handling inheritance correctly. The issue likely lies in how the choices are being handled and if they are correctly inherited and utilized in the child class. The provided code does not show any checks for inherited choices or how the choices are updated when a model inherits and modifies them. This indicates a potential gap in the handling of choices in inherited models, which could explain the observed behavior.",

The key elements to look for in the code are the handling of choices in model fields and the implementation of the `_get_FIELD_display` method in the `Model` class. From the file context, the `_get_FIELD_display` method in `Model` is found, which is crucial for understanding the current implementation of displaying field values based on choices. The method retrieves the value of the field and looks up the display value from a dictionary created from field choices. In the search results, the `Field` class is found with its `choices` attribute and the `_get_flatchoices` method that may affect how choices are processed for display. These code spans are relevant because they help understand how choices are defined and processed in Django models. The issue suggests that the method does not work as expected for new choices added through inheritance, pointing to a potential problem with how the choices are being captured and used in the `_get_FIELD_display` method. Therefore, the identified spans from both `base.py` and `__init__.py` are essential for diagnosing the issue and potentially modifying the behavior to accommodate inherited choices correctly.",
