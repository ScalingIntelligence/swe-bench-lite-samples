The example provided shows a base model with choices and a child model that inherits and extends these choices. The problem is that invoking get_field_foo_display() on an instance of the child model results in incorrect display for the newly added choices.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans identified are:\n1. In django/db/models/base.py, the `_get_FIELD_display` span which contains the method definition for _get_FIELD_display(). This method is responsible for retrieving the display value for a field based on its choices.\n2. In django/db/models/fields/__init__.py, the `Field.get_choices` span which includes the get_choices() method for Field. This method is used to retrieve the choices for a field.\n\nThese two spans are directly related to the functionality of displaying choices for model fields, which is central to the reported issue. The _get_FIELD_display method is crucial as it demonstrates how the display value is retrieved in Django, and understanding its logic is necessary to identify why the new choices added in the child model are not being displayed correctly. The get_choices method is also relevant as it deals with the management and retrieval of choices for fields, which could be a part of the issue if the choices are not being properly passed or recognized in the child model.\n\nGiven the context and the code spans reviewed, these sections are deemed relevant to the reported issue.",
