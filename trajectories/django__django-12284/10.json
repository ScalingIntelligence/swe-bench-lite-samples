This suggests a deeper issue with how choices are inherited and processed in Django's model system. To debug this, we need to examine the functions related to choice handling and display in Django's model fields, specifically focusing on the `Field` class in the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file and the `Model` class in the `django/db/models/base.py` file. Additionally, the `ChoicesMeta` and `Choices` classes in `django/db/models/enums.py` might be relevant since they deal with choice initialization and representation. We also need to check if there are any specific methods in the `ModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` that might affect the choice display.",

Specifically, when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, the `get_foo_display` method fails to correctly display the new choices added by the child model. To address this, it's essential to identify the relevant code spans that handle choices and their display in Django's model field implementation. \n\nUpon reviewing the provided search results, the key sections to focus on are:\n1. `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` - This file contains the `Field` class definition, which includes the `__init__` method where the `choices` parameter is handled, and the `get_choices` method which retrieves the choices for the field.\n2. `django/db/models/enums.py` - This file contains the `ChoicesMeta` class, which is related to handling choices in Django models, particularly with the `__new__` method that processes the choices.\n3. `django/contrib/admin/options.py` - This file contains the `ModelAdmin` class, which is not directly relevant to the issue at hand but provides context on how Django admin handles model display and interaction.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified are:\n- `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` - `Field.__init__` and `Field.get_choices`\n- `django/db/models/enums.py` - `ChoicesMeta.__new__`\n\nThese sections of code are crucial for understanding how choices are set and retrieved in Django models, which is directly related to the reported issue.

To address this, I'll analyze the provided code spans to identify areas relevant to model field choices and the display method.\n\n1. **Existing Context Review**: The initial file context includes `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `ChoicesMeta` class in `django/db/models/enums.py`, both of which are directly related to model field choices and their handling. The `Field.__init__` method includes the initialization of the `choices` attribute, and the `Field.get_choices` method is responsible for handling choices listing.\n\n2. **New Search Results Analysis**: \n   - The new search results include additional sections from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`.\n   - In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `Field` class and its `__init__` method are reiterated, emphasizing the choices initialization and the `get_choices` method, which appropriately processes choices options.\n   - In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model` class is revealed with its `__init__` method handling model instance initialization, and more importantly, the `_get_FIELD_display` method which is directly responsible for displaying the human-readable value of a field.\n\n3. **Relevant Code Identification**: \n   - The `Model._get_FIELD_display` method is particularly relevant as it is the core method to resolve the issue with displaying choices. This method maps the field value to its corresponding display value using the choices list.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue include methods handling the choices options and the display logic in both `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`.",
