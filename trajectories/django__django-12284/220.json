It is evident that the method might not be adequately using the overridden choices of the child model. The primary focus should be on the `models.py` file where the `Field` class and the `Model` class are defined, with a special emphasis on methods like `get_choices` and `_get_FIELD_display`. Additionally, considering that this might also involve field inheritance and choices, `base.py` and `fields/__init__.py` are the key areas to investigate. I will initiate the search with these considerations.",

Specifically, when the child model adds new choices, the display method does not return the expected output for these new choices. The provided `django/db/models/base.py` file contains key parts of the Django Model class that might be relevant to address the issue. Particularly, the method `_get_FILED_display` is responsible for returning the display value based on the choices. This method is likely where the problem lies since it deals directly with the choices and their display values. It uses a dictionary to map choices to their display values and then retrieves the display value based on the field's value. The issue might be that the dictionary is not updated with the new choices from the child model, causing it to return the wrong display values for the new choices. By identifying the relevant parts of the code responsible for handling display values and choices, we can pinpoint where the issue arises and what needs to be fixed to address the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the `Model.get_FOO_display()` method not working correctly with inherited choices in Django. The provided context from `django/db/models/base.py` includes the `_get_FIELD_display` method which is responsible for displaying the human-readable value of a field based on its choices. This method uses the field's `flatchoices` attribute to map the field's value to its display value. The new search results from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` provide insight into the `Field` class and its `choices` attribute, which is relevant for understanding how choices are set.\n\nKey observations:\n- The `Field` class has an `__init__` method where the `choices` attribute is set. When a `Field` is initialized with `choices`, those choices are stored. The `_get_FIELD_display` method, found in the `Model` class, uses these choices in its logic to determine the display value. This suggests that any issue might arise from how choices are set or inherited during initialization.\n- The `Field` class's `get_choices` method also retrieves choices if they are defined. This method includes logic for handling blank choices and potentially limiting choices based on specific criteria.\n\nConclusion: The issue with `get_FOO_display` not working correctly with inherited choices could stem from how choices are handled during inheritance, particularly if the `flatchoices` attribute does not correctly include all inherited choices or if the method logic does not account for the possibility of overridden choices. Both the `_get_FIELD_display` method and the initialization of the `Field` class in the provided context are critical for understanding and resolving the issue.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it seems like the identified sections of code are relevant to understanding the problem, but reviewing how inheritance is handled specifically with `choices` and the `flatchoices` attribute may be necessary to see how the logic is applied from inherited models to instances of the child model.",
