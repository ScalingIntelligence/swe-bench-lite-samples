Additionally, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` is relevant as it is where the model instances are actually created and methods like `get_FOO_display()` would be invoked.

It may be necessary to broaden the search beyond the initial focus on the `Model` and `Field` classes, potentially including other related classes or modules that interact with model instances or fields. Additionally, since the issue concerns inherited choices, it's important to consider how Django handles inheritance, especially in the context of fields with choices, and how this might influence the behavior of `get_FIELD_display`. It's also possible that the method is implemented in a way that interacts with the database or other middleware components, suggesting the need for a wider search scope within the Django's source code.",

Specifically, it involves a base model with choices and a child model that inherits and adds more choices. The method `get_field_foo_display()` works correctly for existing choices but fails to return the expected output for new choices added in the child model.\n\nFrom the provided file context, we see code related to model fields and their initialization in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. Notably, the `Field` class and its subclasses like `CharField` and `BooleanField` are present, along with their initialization methods.\n\nIn the search results, we found relevant code spans in `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/options.py`. The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` contains the method `_get_FIELD_display()`, which is used to display the selected choice for a field. This method uses the field's `flatchoices` to map the field's value to its display value. However, the issue pertains to the incorrect handling of new choices added in child models.\n\nIn `django/db/models/options.py`, the `Options` class includes methods like `get_base_chain()` and `get_parent_list()`, which are related to model inheritance. These methods might help in understanding how child models inherit from their parents but do not directly address the issue with `get_FIELD_display()`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the `_get_FIELD_display()` method in `Model` is the primary focus for addressing the issue. It is identified that the method might not correctly handle choices added post-inheritance.\n\nTherefore, the identified spans are from `django/db/models/base.py`, specifically the `_get_FIELD_display()` method, which needs to be inspected for potential fixes or enhancements to correctly handle inherited choices.",
