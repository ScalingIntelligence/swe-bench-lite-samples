Specifically, the `get_field_foo_display()` method is not functioning as expected when new choices are added in a child model. The problem likely resides in how Django handles choices in abstract base classes and their child classes. The initial search should focus on the `Field` class within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and the `Model` class within `django/db/models/base.py`, as these are central to model field management and model operations respectively. Additionally, since the issue involves choices, the `ChoicesMeta` and `Choices` classes within `django/db/models/enums.py` should also be investigated.",

The `_get_FIELD_display` method is particularly relevant, as it is responsible for retrieving the human-readable value of a field choice based on the current value of the field. This method uses a dictionary created from the field's choices to map the current value to its display value. However, it is not immediately clear how this method behaves when choices are overridden or extended in child models. Further investigation into methods handling field choices in the context of inheritance, such as those in the `ChoicesMeta` and `Choices` classes in `django/db/models/enums.py`, is necessary to fully understand how Django manages and propagates choices through inheritance.",

The issue is particularly with the new tuples added in child models. The current file context and search results show relevant code spans in the 'django/db/models/base.py' file, specifically the '_get_FIELD_display' method. This method is responsible for displaying the appropriate choice label based on the value. The method retrieves the value of the field and maps it to the corresponding choice label using a dictionary created from the field's flatchoices. The problem seems to be that the new choices added in child models are not properly accounted for in this mapping.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/enums.py', the ChoicesMeta class and its methods like '__new__', '__contains__', 'names', 'choices', 'labels', and 'values' are related to the handling of choices in models. However, these methods appear to be more about defining and managing choices at the class level rather than resolving the issue of displaying choices in individual model instances.\n\nThe key problem identified is that the '_get_FIELD_display' method in 'django/db/models/base.py' does not dynamically update the choices dictionary when a child model inherits and adds new choices. This suggests that the method should be updated to consider the choices defined in the child model when determining the display value.\n\nGiven the issue and the current context, the relevant code spans to address the problem are in 'django/db/models/base.py' under the '_get_FIELD_display' method.

Specifically, the issue arises when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, adding new tuples. The expected behavior is that `get_FOO_display()` should correctly return the display value for the new tuples added in the child model, but it does not. The provided file context includes relevant sections from `django/db/models/base.py`, particularly the `Model` class definition and the `_get_FIELD_display` method. This method is responsible for returning the display value based on the choices defined for a field. The search results include additional context from `django/db/models/enums.py`, which defines the `Choices` class and related metadata. This context further elucidates how choices are managed and how the `ChoicesMeta` class handles the creation of choice-based enums. The identified code spans provide a comprehensive overview of the underlying mechanisms related to model field choices and their display values, which are essential for addressing the reported issue.",
