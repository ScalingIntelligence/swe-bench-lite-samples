The `get_choices` method in the search results retrieves the choices for the field, which could potentially be used to improve the handling of choices in the inherited models.

Although the specific behavior of inherited choices merging or overriding is not explicitly detailed in the provided context, the context is sufficient to understand the general mechanisms involved in choices processing. There is a method `get_choices` in the `Field` class, suggesting it might handle how choices are retrieved, including potential considerations for inherited choices.
