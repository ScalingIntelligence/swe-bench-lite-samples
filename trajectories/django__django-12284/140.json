Specifically, the issue arises when a child model inherits from a base model and adds new choices to a field defined in the base model. The expected behavior is that the `get_foo_display()` method should correctly resolve the display value for all choices, including the ones added by the child model. The `get_foo_display()` method is part of the `Model` class in Django, and it is used to get the display value of a field with choices. The relevant code spans from the `django/db/models/base.py` file include the definition of the `_get_FIELD_display` method within the `Model` class. This method is responsible for resolving the display value of a field, but it seems to not be handling the new choices added in the child model.

            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it seems that the problem lies in the functionality of `Model.get_foo_display()` when dealing with inherited choices. The issue specifically mentions that when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides or adds new choices, the `get_foo_display()` method does not behave as expected with the new choices. This indicates that the method is not correctly handling the updated choices from the child model.\n\nGiven the file context, the focus should be on the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method, which currently retrieves the displayed value based on the choices defined in the field. This method relies on the `choices_dict`, which is constructed from `field.flatchoices`, and it currently does not account for the possibility of choices being overridden in a child model.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant files include `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`. The `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` contains the handling of choices, but there isn't a direct instance of handling overridden choices from child models. The `Model._get_FIELD_display` method in `django/db/models/base.py` currently relies on `field.flatchoices`, which needs to adapt to the new choices from the child model.\n\nTo address the issue, the focus should be on how the `choices_dict` in `Model._get_FIELD_display` can be updated dynamically to include the choices from the child model if they are overridden. This might involve checking the current instance's model to determine if it is a child model and then updating the `choices_dict` accordingly.\n\nGiven the search results, there is a potential to solve the issue by enhancing the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method to dynamically include new or overridden choices from the child model, but this would require further code analysis and possibly modifications to handle the dynamic nature of inherited choices.",
