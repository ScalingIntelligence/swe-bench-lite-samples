However, this file does not directly address the method `get_foo_display()`. \n\nIn `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `Field` class and its initialization (`Field.__init__`) are significant. This class is responsible for defining model fields, including those with choices. The method `Field.get_choices()` is particularly relevant as it constructs the choices for a field. This method could be the key to understanding how choices are managed and why new choices in a child model might not be handled correctly by `get_foo_display()`. \n\nAdditionally, `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` contains the `ForeignObjectRel` class, which is related to handling reverse relationships in models. However, this class seems less directly relevant to the issue at hand regarding choices and their display in the context of inheritance.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most relevant code spans are those in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` related to the `Field` class and its `get_choices()` method, as they address the management of field choices, which is central to the reported issue.",

Specifically, when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, the `get_foo_display()` method does not return the expected output for the new choices added in the child model.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the logic for choice fields and their display values. After examining the provided search results, we can see that the `Field` class and its methods are relevant, especially `Field.__init__` and `Field.get_choices`. These methods handle the initialization of the field and the retrieval of choices, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the `ForeignObjectRel` class from `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` is also relevant, particularly the `get_choices` method within this class. This method deals with related model choices and might influence how choices are processed in inherited models.\n\nBased on the identified relevant code spans, we can deduce that the core handling of choices in Django models is encapsulated within the `Field` and `ForeignObjectRel` classes. Therefore, these are the key areas to focus on when addressing the issue of incorrect display with inherited choices.",

The `get_choices` method in the `Field` class appears to handle choices, but there is no explicit mention or handling of inherited choices in the provided code. Additionally, while the `ForeignObjectRel` class has a `get_choices` method, it doesn't directly address the issue of choices inheritance either.\n\nGiven the current file context, it's clear that the relevant code for handling choices is present, but it doesn't specifically address the problem of inherited choices in models, which is the core issue reported.
