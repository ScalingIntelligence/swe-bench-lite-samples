The expected behavior is that when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, the `get_foo_display()` method should correctly handle the new choices. However, in the provided example, the method fails to return the correct display value for the new choices added in the child model. The focus should be on the `get_FIELD_display` method in the `Model` class within `django/db/models/base.py` to understand how it handles inherited choices. Additionally, the `get_choices` method in the `Field` class within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` might also need inspection to ensure it properly reflects inherited choices.",

The example provided shows a base model with choices and a child model that inherits and overrides these choices. The get_foo_display method fails to correctly display the new choices added by the child model.\n\nFrom the search results, two key code spans are identified as relevant:\n1. 'Model._get_FIELD_display' in django/db/models/base.py: This method is responsible for displaying the choices associated with a field. It uses the field's choices to find the appropriate display value. The issue seems to stem from how these choices are being inherited and overridden.\n2. 'Field.get_choices' in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py: This method fetches the choices for a field, which could be relevant in understanding how choices propagate through inheritance. The issue might be related to how choices are being processed and applied in the child model.\n\nThese spans address the core functionality related to choices and their display in Django models. They suggest that the issue could be rooted in how choices are set and retrieved in both the base and child models. Further investigation and potentially adjusting how choices are inherited and applied in the child model might resolve the issue.",
