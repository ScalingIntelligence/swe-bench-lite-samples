Specifically, the issue arises when a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices, with the method not functioning as expected for new tuples added in the child model. Upon analysis of the provided search results, the relevant code span to focus on is the `Model._get_FIELD_display` method, which is responsible for displaying the human-readable version of a field's value based on the choices provided. This method is crucial for understanding and addressing the issue, as it directly deals with how the display value is retrieved from the choices. The method uses the field's choices to map the field's value to the corresponding display value. The problem likely lies in how the choices are being inherited and overridden, which affects the internal dictionary used for mapping. As no additional related code spans are found in the search results, this single span is enough to inform a solution to the issue.",

The method uses the field's choices and the current field value to find the appropriate display value. This is directly related to the issue described, where new choices added in a child model do not have their display values returned correctly when using the `get_foo_display` method. Given the method's presence and its role in handling choice display values, it seems relevant to addressing the issue. Additionally, the method correctly handles the inheritance and fetching of choices based on the field's attributes like `flatchoices` and `attname`. The method also deals with the default value gracefully if the choice is not found. Thus, the relevant code to address the issue is present in the provided file context.",
