The issue is that the 'modules' view function is receiving more positional arguments than expected, which raises a TypeError. This is likely due to changes in how Django handles URL pattern matching and view function arguments in version 3.0. In the search results, the code related to URL resolution and pattern matching in `django/urls/resolvers.py` should be examined, particularly focusing on `URLPattern` and `URLResolver` classes and their methods. The `resolve` method in `URLPattern` class shows how the URL resolution process tries to match the incoming path to a pattern and calls the associated view function with the matched arguments. This is directly related to the issue of passing too many arguments to the 'modules' view function. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those related to URL resolution and pattern matching, specifically focusing on how arguments are passed to the view functions.",

The error trace points to an incompatibility in how Django 3.0 handles URL resolution compared to previous versions. The provided search results contain several relevant sections, primarily focusing on URL resolution within Django's URL resolution module ('django/urls/resolvers.py'). Key spans include the 'URLPattern' class, specifically the '__init__' method defining the URL pattern's callback and the 'resolve' method which matches the URL pattern to the appropriate view function. Additionally, the 'URLResolver' class is relevant with its 'resolve' method, which is used for resolving a URL path to the appropriate view function considering nested patterns and namespaces. This provides a comprehensive understanding of how URL resolution works in Django 3.0, particularly with the handling of positional arguments passed to view functions. Based on the issue and the context provided, the identified spans are relevant as they directly pertain to the reported issue's core problem involving URL pattern resolution and positional argument handling.",
