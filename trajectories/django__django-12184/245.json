Specifically, the view function 'modules' is being called with more positional arguments than it is defined to accept. This issue is likely related to changes in how Django processes URL patterns and how view functions are resolved and called. \n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant code spans are identified in the 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/urls/base.py' files. These include the ResolverMatch class, which deals with the resolution of URLs to view functions, and the URLPattern class, which handles the patterns and callbacks for URLs. Additionally, the URLResolver class is crucial as it manages the resolution process for URLs, including handling URL patterns and resolving them to the appropriate view function.\n\nThe 'ResolverMatch.__init__' method and the 'URLPattern.resolve' method are particularly relevant. The former initializes the ResolverMatch object with details about the matched URL, including the function to call and the arguments to pass. The latter tries to resolve a given path to a view function, passing any matched arguments. Together, these parts of the code are central to how Django maps URLs to views and how it passes arguments to those views.\n\nGiven these elements, it seems likely that the issue lies in how Django 3.0 handles the resolution of URLs with optional parameters and how it passes these parameters to the view functions. The identified code spans provide a good starting point to understand and potentially fix the issue.",

The error message indicates that the 'modules' view function expects 1 to 2 positional arguments but receives 3. This discrepancy points to a potential change in how Django handles URL resolution and the passing of keyword arguments to view functions between versions. The relevant sections of the codebase are those that deal with URL resolution and the construction of arguments to be passed to view functions. The 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver' classes in 'django/urls/resolvers.py' are central to this process. Specifically, the 'resolve' method in both classes should be examined. Additionally, the 'ResolverMatch' class is involved in constructing the final set of arguments to be passed to the view function. Given the nature of the reported issue, the focus should be on understanding how optional parameters in URL patterns are being handled and how this affects the construction of arguments for view functions.",

The `URLPattern.resolve` method constructs a `ResolverMatch` object, which includes the callback function and the arguments it receives. The issue arises because the view function `modules` is receiving more positional arguments than expected, which might be due to how the `resolve` method processes optional parameters. The provided context gives a clear insight into the structure and functioning of URL resolution, but lacks specific details on how Django 3.0 changes the handling of optional parameters compared to Django 2.2.
