The search should focus on the 'modules' view function and the URL configuration to identify where the additional positional arguments are coming from and how to adjust the code to handle these scenarios correctly.",

The `_get_full_path` method also deals with constructing the full request path, which is relevant for URL parsing.\n\n2. **django/utils/http.py**: This file contains utility functions for HTTP handling, including functions for URL quoting, encoding, and parsing. The `limited_parse_qsl` function, in particular, is relevant as it parses URL query strings and could be involved in the handling of URL parameters.\n\n3. **django/urls/base.py**: This file contains core URL resolution functions.

The provided file context does not directly address the specific issue of optional URL parameters causing crashes in the 'modules' view function after upgrading to Django 3.0. Although Django's internal mechanisms for handling HTTP requests and URL resolutions are relevant, they do not directly contain the application's specific 'modules' view function or its URL pattern configuration. Therefore, a more localized search within the application's codebase for the 'modules' view function and its URL configuration is warranted. This will help pinpoint where adjustments are needed to align with Django 3.0's changes.",
