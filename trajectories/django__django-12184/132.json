This suggests a change in how Django handles URL resolution and view invocation might be the cause. The search results from 'django/core/handlers/base.py' reveal critical sections related to URL resolution and view processing, particularly the '_get_response' method which is responsible for handling the processing chain after the URL resolution. This method contains the logic where the view function is invoked with positional arguments. This makes the '_get_response' span especially relevant because it directly involves the callback function (view) and its arguments. Additionally, the middleware loading in 'load_middleware' could potentially affect how the view is called, so it's also relevant.

This suggests a need to review the URL configuration and the view function itself to ensure that the correct number of arguments are passed. Given the current file context, we have already identified the relevant Django core middleware processing code, which includes how middleware handles view functions and how arguments are passed to these functions. The new search results provide additional context around URL handling, including how URL resolvers are defined and how patterns are managed in Django. Specifically, the 'URLResolver' class and the associated methods provide detailed insight into how Django processes URL patterns and resolves them to view functions. These details are crucial for understanding how Django 3.0 might differ in handling URL patterns compared to previous versions. The 'URLResolver.url_patterns' and 'URLResolver.__init__' spans provide key information on how URL patterns are stored and how the URLResolver is initialized, which is central to understanding the issue at hand. Additionally, the 'get_resolver' function is directly related to fetching the resolver for URL patterns, which could be a point of difference between Django versions. This span is relevant as it indicates how the URL resolution mechanism works, which could be a contributing factor to the reported issue. Overall, these spans are highly relevant as they directly relate to the URL configuration and resolution, processes that are central to the reported issue.",
