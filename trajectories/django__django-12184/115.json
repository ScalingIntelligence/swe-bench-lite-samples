The URLConf definition specifies a pattern with an optional 'format' parameter, which should be passed as a keyword argument to the view function. However, due to changes in Django 3.0, this might be leading to the view being called with an incorrect number of arguments. The traceback indicates that the error occurs during the URL resolution process, specifically when the view function is invoked. Searching for the 'modules' function in the relevant Django views files and checking how URL resolution is handled in Django 3.0 will help pinpoint the exact cause.",

The provided search results include several key sections of Django's URL resolving mechanism, such as the URLPattern and URLResolver classes, which are central to understanding how URLs are matched to view functions. The URLPattern class's 'resolve' method is particularly relevant, as it handles the resolution of a given path to a view function, potentially including extra arguments. The URLResolver class also plays a crucial role in this process, managing the resolution of URLs across multiple URL configuration modules. Given the error message, the code spans related to URLPattern and URLResolver should be further examined to identify any discrepancies in argument handling between Django versions. Additionally, the '_route_to_regex' function, which converts URL routes to regular expressions, may also be relevant if changes in regex handling between Django versions are affecting argument parsing. The code spans identified here provide a starting point for understanding and potentially resolving the issue.",

This suggests a problem with how the URL pattern is being resolved and passed to the view function. The provided context and search results focus on the URL resolution process in Django. The context includes the code from 'django/urls/resolvers.py', which is crucial for understanding how URL patterns are matched and resolved to view functions. The search results provide additional examples and context on how URL patterns are defined and resolved in different parts of Django's contrib modules. Based on the issue description, the relevant code spans are those that deal with URL pattern resolution, particularly the 'resolve' method in 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver' classes, as well as the '_route_to_regex' function which constructs the regex patterns for URL routes. These sections are critical for identifying how the URL parameters are being processed and passed to the view functions.",

The traceback points to a problem in the URL resolution process, where the view function is being called with more arguments than it can handle. The provided search results, which include code from Django's url resolution and view handling logic, help in understanding how Django processes URL patterns and how it might differ between versions. The relevant files from Django's core, especially 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and checks in 'django/core/checks/urls.py', provide insight into URL pattern matching and argument handling. The other files listed, such as those from contrib modules, while interesting, do not directly address the issue of too many positional arguments being passed to a view function due to an optional URL parameter. Therefore, focusing on 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and its handling of URL patterns and arguments is crucial. Additionally, since the issue references a change in Django's behavior from 2.2 to 3.0, reviewing changes in the Django release notes or migration guides for possible related changes could be beneficial for a more comprehensive understanding.",

The key problem is that the view function `modules` is now receiving more positional arguments than it can handle. This discrepancy is evident in the view definition, where the default parameter 'format' is specified, but it appears to be problematic in the new Django version. The analysis of the search results shows that there are several URL configurations in Django's contrib modules that use optional parameters similarly. However, these examples are not directly related to the issue since they don't involve the same error context. The focus should be on understanding how Django's URL resolution has changed between versions to handle optional parameters more effectively. The relevant code spans from the current context and search results that deal with URL resolution and parameter handling in Django should be identified. Specifically, the `URLPattern` and `URLResolver` classes from `django/urls/resolvers.py` are crucial as they define how URLs are matched and how view functions are called with the appropriate arguments. Additionally, understanding the changes in the `check_resolver` function in `django/core/checks/urls.py` could provide insights into potential compatibility issues between Django versions.",
