The error indicates that the view function 'modules' is receiving more positional arguments than expected. This could be due to changes in how Django matches URL patterns to view functions or how keyword arguments are passed. To resolve this, we need to find the specific changes in Django 3.0 related to URL pattern matching and view function invocation. We should focus on the URL pattern and view function definitions, as well as any helper functions or middleware that might interact with them.",

The specific view in question is 'modules', which takes a 'format' parameter with a default value of 'html'. However, with the upgrade to Django 3.0, the view is receiving an unexpected third argument, causing the TypeError.\n\nTo find relevant code spans, I looked for sections related to URL pattern resolution, especially those dealing with the handling of view functions and their arguments. The code spans that are particularly relevant include those in 'django/urls/resolvers.py' (e.g., 'URLPattern.resolve', 'URLResolver.resolve') and 'django/urls/conf.py' (e.g., '_path', 'path', 're_path'), as these files contain the logic for matching URLs to views and passing arguments to them.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, the identified spans in 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/urls/conf.py' are critical as they directly pertain to the URL resolution process in Django and how view functions and their parameters are handled. These spans are likely to contain the code that affects the behavior causing the reported issue. Further, the 'URLPattern.resolve' and 'URLResolver.resolve' methods are particularly important as they involve the actual resolution of URLs to views and the passing of arguments to these views.",

The error indicates that the `modules` view function is receiving more positional arguments than it expects, which seems to be caused by a mismatch in how URL patterns are resolved and how view functions are invoked. The provided context includes the implementation of URLPattern and URLResolver classes in `django/urls/resolvers.py`. The resolution process involves matching URL paths and invoking the corresponding view functions with arguments captured from the URL pattern. The issue likely arises from how optional URL parameters are handled, potentially due to changes in parameter handling in Django 3.0. To fix this, the focus should be on ensuring that the `modules` view function correctly handles the optional `format` parameter.",
