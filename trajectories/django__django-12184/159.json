The error message indicates that the function is receiving 3 arguments when it expects either 1 or 2. This discrepancy suggests changes in how Django handles URL parameters or view initialization.\n\nGiven the search results, the most relevant file appears to be 'django/views/generic/base.py', which contains the base 'View' class along with its initialization and view dispatch mechanisms. Specifically, the '__init__' and 'as_view' methods in the 'View' class are likely places where Django has introduced changes affecting view initialization and argument handling.\n\nIn the provided spans, 'View.__init__' and 'View.as_view' are crucial as they define how a view instance is created and how it handles incoming request arguments. These methods could explain the changes leading to the described TypeError. Notably, the 'as_view' method explicitly checks for and handles keyword arguments, which might not have been strictly enforced in older versions of Django.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will proceed to identify the relevant spans in 'django/views/generic/base.py' that are likely to be related to the issue.",
