These files are indeed central to URL routing and view function invocation in Django. The ResolverMatch class and the resolve method in the URLResolver class specifically handle the resolution of URLs to view functions. Additionally, the BaseHandler class in 'django/core/handlers/base.py' is responsible for processing requests and invoking the appropriate view functions. The reported issue involves an error where too many arguments are being passed to the 'modules' view function in Django 3.0, which suggests changes in how URL parameters are handled. The provided code in the file context shows the relevant classes and methods used in this process, making it plausible that the relevant code context has been identified. However, without the ability to modify the codebase or suggest changes, I cannot confirm that the issue would be fully resolved by examining only this context.",
