The provided context from `django/urls/resolvers.py` shows the `URLResolver` class and its `resolve` method, which is responsible for matching URLs and invoking the corresponding view functions. The key changes to focus on involve how optional parameters are handled and how arguments are passed to the view functions. Additionally, investigating any changes in Django 3.0's URL resolution mechanisms that might affect the behavior is crucial.",

This could be due to changes in how Django handles URL pattern matching and view function invocation in versions 3.0 and above. The relevant code spans to look at would include the URLPattern and URLResolver classes, especially their __init__ and resolve methods, as these deal with pattern matching and view resolution. The spans 'URLPattern.__init__', 'URLPattern.resolve', 'URLResolver.__init__', and 'URLResolver.resolve' are particularly relevant as they involve the setup and execution of URL patterns and their corresponding view functions. Additionally, the 'URLResolver._populate' method, which preprocesses the URL patterns, might also be relevant if the issue stems from how patterns are being populated or matched against the URL. Looking specifically at the 'URLResolver.resolve' method, we see how it resolves a URL path to a view; this process involves handling the arguments passed to the view function, which is central to the reported issue. Since the exact code change causing the issue isn't immediately apparent, it would be prudent to also consider broader changes in the Django framework's handling of URLs and views between versions 2.2 and 3.0. Without access to comprehensive change logs or additional context on specific updates in Django 3.0, analyzing the provided code spans should focus on identifying potential mismatches between expected and actual arguments passed to view functions during URL pattern matching.",
