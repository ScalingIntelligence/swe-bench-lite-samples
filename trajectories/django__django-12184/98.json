This suggests that the URL pattern definition and the view function's signature need careful examination. \n2. **Relevant Code in Search Results**: \n   - **URL Pattern Definition**: The search results do not directly include the user's URLConf definition, but the issue is related to URL pattern handling and view function invocation. \n   - **URLResolver Class**: The `URLResolver` class in `django/urls/resolvers.py` is relevant because it manages URL patterns and resolves them to view functions. Especially relevant are the spans 'URLResolver.__init__' and 'URLResolver.resolve_error_handler'. \n   - **BaseHandler Class**: The `BaseHandler` class in `django/core/handlers/base.py` is responsible for handling requests and responses, including middleware and view invocation. The span 'BaseHandler.load_middleware' is pertinent as it pertains to middleware that might affect view function calls. \n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the Django core files provided in the search results, the most relevant spans are from the `URLResolver` class and the `BaseHandler` class, as they directly relate to URL pattern resolution and request handling, which are central to the issue at hand. These spans provide context for how URL patterns are processed and how view functions might be called, which can help diagnose and potentially fix the TypeError described.",

This issue seems to have arisen when upgrading Django from version 2.2 to 3.0. After analyzing the provided code spans and the reported issue, I've observed that the problem might be due to the change in how Django handles URL parameters and view functions. Specifically, the problem could be related to the handling of the 'format' parameter in the URL configuration and the view function definition. The relevant code spans identified from the search results include the initialization of URLResolver, the method to resolve error handlers in URLResolver, and the middleware loading process in BaseHandler, as these are directly linked to URL resolution and request handling which might be affected by the optional URL parameters issue. The other spans in the search results do not directly relate to the reported issue. Based on this analysis, we should focus more on the URL resolution and request handling code spans.",

Given the context provided in <file_context>, I need to identify relevant code spans in the <search_results> that could be contributing to or resolving this issue. After reviewing the <search_results>, I've concluded that the most relevant code span is in 'django/utils/decorators.py', specifically the 'make_middleware_decorator' function which wraps a view function and processes middleware. This function is crucial because it handles the invocation of view functions and their arguments, which is directly related to the reported issue. The other code spans in the search results, such as settings and middleware definitions, are less directly related to the specific TypeError issue and more to the overall configuration of Django.",
