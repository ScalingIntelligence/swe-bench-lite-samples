The error traceback suggests that the `modules` view function is receiving more positional arguments than expected. This typically occurs when the URL pattern and the view function signature do not align. After analyzing the search results, I focused on the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file, particularly the `URLPattern` and `URLResolver` classes, as they handle the resolution of URL patterns to view functions. The `resolve` method in the `URLResolver` class is particularly relevant as it attempts to match a request path to a URL pattern. Additionally, examining the `URLPattern.__init__` and `URLPattern.resolve` methods provides insights into how URL patterns are initialized and how they resolve paths to view functions. This context is crucial for understanding the mismatch between URL patterns and view signatures, which is likely causing the reported error.",
