The view function 'modules' is expected to handle 1 to 2 positional arguments but is receiving 3, causing a TypeError. This could be due to a change in how Django matches and passes URL parameters to view functions. The traceback suggests that the error occurs in the '_get_response' method of 'django.core.handlers.base.BaseHandler', indicating that the issue might be in how the URL patterns are resolved and passed to the view. To pinpoint the exact cause, it would be helpful to focus on the 'modules' view function and the URL patterns defined in the URLConf.",

Specifically, the 'URLPattern.resolve' method in 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and the '_get_response' method in 'django/core/handlers/base.py' are critical as they handle the matching of URLs to views and the invocation of those view functions. These spans should be examined to understand how URL parameters are passed to view functions and whether any changes in Django 3.0 are causing the excessive arguments.
