The error message indicates that the view function is receiving more positional arguments than expected. This suggests a potential change in how URL parameters are being passed to view functions from Django 2.2 to Django 3.0.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/urls/base.py'. These files contain the core URL resolution logic in Django, which includes classes like 'URLPattern', 'URLResolver', and 'ResolverMatch', as well as functions like 'resolve' and 'reverse'.\n\nThe 'URLPattern' class and its 'resolve' method are particularly relevant because they handle the mapping of URLs to view functions. The error could be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual parameters being passed to the view function during the resolution process. This could be due to changes in how optional parameters are handled by 'URLPattern' or 'URLResolver' in Django 3.0 compared to Django 2.2.\n\nGiven the provided search results, the identified code spans include initialization and resolution methods for both 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver'. These spans are likely relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue with optional URL parameters in Django 3.0.\n\nIn conclusion, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue because they involve the core URL resolution logic in Django, which is directly related to the error experienced when using optional URL parameters in view functions.",

The `RoutePattern` class in `django/urls/resolvers.py` shows how Django 3.0 processes routes and converters, which might impact the handling of positional and keyword arguments in view functions. Additionally, the `resolve` method in `URLResolver` is central to URL resolution and could have been modified to enforce stricter checks on the number and type of arguments passed to view functions. To understand these changes better, it's crucial to examine the specific updates in Django 3.0's resolver logic and how these might affect the compatibility of older URL configurations with optional parameters.

This suggests a potential change in how Django 3.0 handles URL resolution or view function invocation. The provided file context and search results contain various parts of Django's URL resolving mechanism, including RegexPattern, URLPattern, and URLResolver classes, which are critical for understanding how URLs are matched and resolved to view functions. The search results also include the base.py file, which contains the resolve and reverse functions. This evidence suggests that the issue could be related to how the URL patterns are defined and how the view functions are called based on these patterns.

Specifically, the `RoutePattern` class's `match` method shows how Django handles optional parameters in routes. The context includes substantial code that would be needed to address the reported issue regarding optional parameters in URLs, as it touches on how URL patterns are compiled and resolved, how optional parameters are treated, and how positional and keyword arguments are passed to view functions. Given this, I believe the relevant code concerning URL resolution and pattern handling is provided. However, since the issue involves a change from Django 2.2 to 3.0, it's possible further changes in Django's core handling of URL patterns might affect the solution, but these are not directly addressable through this file context alone.",
