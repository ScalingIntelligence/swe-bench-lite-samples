The '_get_response' method in 'django/core/handlers/base.py' is where the exception is being raised, indicating that the error might be related to how Django 3.0 handles URL parameters compared to previous versions.

Since the search hasn't yielded results directly related to the 'modules' function or the optional 'format' parameter, we should focus our next search on custom or project-specific files where such configurations and functions might be defined.

The search results include URL resolution functions and classes, which are directly related to URL patterns and their handling.

This issue is likely related to changes in how Django handles URL parameters and view function signatures. Given the context provided, the relevant code spans should include the handling of URL resolution and view function invocation. The BaseHandler class in 'django/core/handlers/base.py' is crucial as it manages the process of resolving URLs and invoking views. The methods '_get_response' and 'process_exception_by_middleware' are particularly relevant as they handle the actual invocation of view functions and exception processing. Additionally, the 'django/urls/resolvers.py' file contains logic for URL resolution, which is directly related to the issue of matching URLs to view functions. The 'ResolverMatch' class and its initialization are important as they determine how URL parameters are passed to view functions. Considering the provided search results, the identified code spans are sufficient to understand and address the issue reported.
