The search results provided contain multiple files and code spans, which are analyzed to identify segments relevant to the reported issue. The focus is on the URL configuration and view handling components of Django. The analysis of the code spans from the search results reveals several key areas that could be relevant to resolving the issue: 1) The `URLResolver` class in `django/urls/resolvers.py` contains methods for resolving URLs and handling patterns, which could be directly related to the URL configuration issue. 2) The `WSGIHandler` and related classes in `django/core/handlers/wsgi.py` handle the request processing and could indirectly relate to the issue as the error occurs at the request handling level. 3) The `resolve` function and `get_resolver` in `django/urls/base.py` are core components for URL resolution, which might provide insights into how the URL is being processed and could help in identifying where the error occurs. Therefore, these identified areas in the search results should be further investigated to resolve the issue.",

The issue likely stems from changes in how Django handles URL resolution and view function calls between versions 2.2 and 3.0. Given the provided context and search results, the relevant parts of the codebase appear to be in `django/urls/resolvers.py`. The `URLResolver` and `URLPattern` classes, especially their `resolve` methods, are critical for understanding how Django matches URLs to view functions. The `URLPattern.resolve` method constructs a `ResolverMatch` object, which includes the view function and the arguments it should receive. The error suggests that the view function is being called with more arguments than expected, which could be due to how arguments are captured and passed in these resolution methods.

The traceback indicates a TypeError due to an incorrect number of positional arguments being passed to the view function 'modules'. This suggests that the URL resolution mechanism in Django 3.0 might be passing more arguments than expected to the view function. The current file context and new search results focus on the URL resolution and matching parts of Django's URL handling system. \n\nFrom the new search results, it's clear that the resolver mechanism in Django 3.0 might have changed in how it handles URL patterns and their matching to view functions. The 'URLPattern' class's 'resolve' method and the 'URLResolver' class's 'resolve' method are particularly relevant as they handle the actual resolution of URLs to view functions. The 'URLResolver.resolve' method shows how it aggregates arguments from the URL pattern match and passes them to the view function, which could be the source of the issue if it's passing more arguments than before. \n\nAlso, worth noting is the 'ResolverMatch' class, which encapsulates the result of URL resolution, and its '__init__' method could have changed to include more parameters, inadvertently affecting the view function calls. The 'URLPattern.__init__' method and its 'resolve' method are also key, as they define how a URL pattern is associated with a callback (view function) and how it resolves a URL path to that callback, respectively. \n\nBased on the alignment of the code spans with the reported issue, I've identified the relevant 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver' class implementations and their methods as key areas that could contain the code related to the issue of passing too many arguments to view functions.",
