The error message indicates that the `modules` view function is receiving more positional arguments than it is designed to handle. This suggests that there might be a change in how Django handles URL patterns or view function arguments between versions. To pinpoint the exact cause, it's important to review the URL pattern configuration and the `modules` view function. Additionally, examining Django's URL resolution and view handling logic in version 3.0 may provide more context on where the discrepancy arises.",

This issue likely stems from changes in how Django handles URL parameters and view functions. The search results need to focus on the URL resolution and view handling parts of Django's core to identify where the mismatch between expected and actual arguments occurs. The provided search results include several spans that are potentially relevant. For instance, the 'resolve' function in `django/urls/base.py` handles URL resolution, which is directly related to the issue of passing optional URL parameters. Additionally, the `_get_response` method in `django/core/handlers/base.py` focuses on handling requests and responses, which is another key area affected by this issue. The 'TemplateView.get' method in `django/views/generic/base.py` is also relevant as it shows how Django handles GET requests in class-based views, which could be related to the view function in question. Given these findings, it appears that the search results are indeed relevant to the reported issue, providing context and potential code sections that may be contributing to the TypeError.",
