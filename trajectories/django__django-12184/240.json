The URL pattern and view function provided in the issue are designed to handle a 'format' parameter which defaults to 'html' if not provided. The error suggests that the view function is receiving more arguments than expected. This could be due to changes in Django's handling of URL parameters or view functions in version 3.0. To address this, we need to look for code spans related to URL pattern handling and view function definitions. The search results include files related to URL handling in Django (`django/urls/__init__.py`, `django/urls/resolvers.py`, and `django/urls/conf.py`). These files contain classes and functions for URL resolution, including `URLPattern` and `URLResolver`, which are likely relevant to the issue. Specifically, the `URLPattern` class and its `resolve` method are of interest, as they handle the matching of URL paths to view functions. Additionally, the `_path` function in `django/urls/conf.py` is relevant because it is used to define URL patterns. These code spans are likely involved in the issue described, as they directly relate to the URL pattern and view function mentioned in the reported issue.",

Specifically relevant are the 'URLPattern.resolve' and 'URLResolver.resolve' methods, which detail how URL patterns are resolved into view functions with their arguments. Additionally, the 'URLResolver._get_cached_resolver' and 'URLResolver.resolve_error_handler' methods also play a role in handling URL resolution and error handling respectively.

The `resolve` method in `URLPattern` details the invocation of the callback (view function) with matched arguments. This context suggests that the changes in Django 3.0 require adjustments in view function signatures to accommodate the new URL resolving mechanism. Reviewing how view functions are called in Django 3.0 and understanding changes in `RoutePattern` and `RegexPattern` are crucial steps to address the issue of positional arguments.

By examining the provided search results, we can identify key sections of code related to URL resolving and middleware processing, which might be contributing to the error. The search results include middleware classes and functions from 'common.py', 'locale.py', 'csrf.py', and 'cache.py', which could potentially interfere with the request processing and the passing of arguments to view functions. However, the most relevant code sections seem to be in 'resolvers.py' and 'conf.py' where URL patterns are defined and resolved. The 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver' classes in 'resolvers.py' handle the resolution of URLs to corresponding view functions, and changes in these classes or their interactions could lead to the reported error. Similarly, the '_path' and 're_path' functions in 'conf.py' are used to define URL patterns, including the one specified in the issue, and changes in these functions could affect how arguments are passed to view functions.

The `resolve` method in `URLPattern` and `URLResolver` classes provides insight into how view functions are invoked with the matched arguments. Therefore, the `modules` view function likely needs to be adjusted to correctly accept and handle the positional and keyword arguments that are passed to it during URL resolution. Specifically, it might need to be updated to handle the `request` object along with the `format` parameter properly, which could be done either by explicitly defining the `format` parameter in the function signature or by ensuring that the URL pattern does not inadvertently pass extra arguments. Additionally, reviewing any middleware or other URL configuration settings that might influence how the `request` object is processed could also be beneficial.",
