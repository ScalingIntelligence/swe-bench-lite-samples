The error occurs because the view function 'modules' is receiving more positional arguments than expected. This suggests a change in how URL parameters are handled or passed to view functions in Django 3.0. The search results contain code from 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/urls/base.py'. In 'resolvers.py', the 'URLPattern.resolve' method processes the URL pattern and might be passing extra arguments to the view function. This aligns with the error described in the issue. The 'resolve' function in 'base.py' also plays a role in directing the URL resolution process. Based on these findings, the relevant code spans are those dealing with URL resolution and passing parameters to view functions.",

Specifically, the 'resolve' method in 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver' classes is crucial as it is responsible for matching URLs to their corresponding view functions and passing the correct arguments.
