This discrepancy likely stems from changes in how Django processes URL patterns and their corresponding view functions across versions. The key elements to focus on are the URL pattern resolution and how view functions are called. In the search results, the most relevant code spans are those within the 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver' classes, particularly the 'resolve' methods where URL resolution occurs. These methods dictate how the view functions are called with arguments extracted from the URL patterns. Additionally, the 'ResolverMatch' class, which determines the callback function and its arguments, is pertinent. Given the issue's specifics, focusing on the 'resolve' methods in 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver' should provide insight into the argument passing mechanism and potential points of misalignment with the view function's expected signature. This will help in identifying the root cause of the 'modules() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 3 were given' error.

This suggests a compatibility issue in URL resolution and view function parameter handling. The search results and file context provided show relevant code spans, particularly in 'django/urls/resolvers.py', where 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver' classes are defined. These classes handle URL resolution and could be the source of the issue. Notably, the 'URLPattern.resolve' method involves updating kwargs with default_args, which might cause issues if the view function does not properly handle. Additionally, the 'URLPattern.__init__' method might also be relevant as it initializes the pattern, callback, default_args, and name, all of which impact the behavior of URL resolution.\n\nThe new search results further confirm this hypothesis, particularly the 'URLResolver' class in 'django/urls/resolvers.py' which processes and matches URL paths. The 'URLResolver.resolve' method directly matches and resolves URL paths, integrating default kwargs and submatch kwargs, potentially leading to an extra parameter being passed to the views if not handled correctly.",

The traceback indicates that the function is receiving more positional arguments than expected. This suggests a change in how Django handles URL parameters between versions 2.2 and 3.0. To address this, we need to focus on the URL resolution and view function handling. After examining the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/urls/base.py' files. Specifically, the ResolverMatch class and its initialization, the URLPattern class, and its resolve method, which all deal with how URL parameters are passed to view functions, are relevant.

Examining the `ResolverMatch` class, which is used to return the result of URL resolution, might also yield insights into changes that affect how view functions receive their arguments.
