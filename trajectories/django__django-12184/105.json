The error indicates that the function expects 1 to 2 positional arguments but receives 3. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the middleware or the URL resolver is passing arguments to the view function. Given the provided search results, the most relevant part of the code is in the `BaseHandler._get_response` method, where the view function is called with arguments extracted from the URL resolver's match. Understanding this code is crucial to determine why the view function is receiving more arguments than expected after upgrading Django. It's possible that changes in how middleware or the URL resolver operates in Django 3.0 might be responsible for the extra arguments being passed to the view function.",

The error message indicates that the view function 'modules' is receiving more positional arguments than it is defined to handle. This suggests a change in how Django handles optional URL parameters between versions 2.2 and 3.0. To address this, I need to focus on code spans that deal with URL resolution, view processing, and middleware handling to understand how the handling of optional parameters might have changed. The relevant files to consider are 'django/core/handlers/base.py' and 'django/urls/resolvers.py'. In 'django/core/handlers/base.py', I should look for the '_get_response' method which is responsible for resolving the view function and handling the middleware chain. In 'django/urls/resolvers.py', the 'URLResolver' class and its 'resolve' method are key, as they handle the actual resolution of the URL to the view function. Given the reported issue, I need to ensure that the handling of optional parameters in the URL pattern and the view function's argument handling are properly aligned to prevent the TypeError. The search results provide relevant code spans that will help in identifying where the optional parameter handling might differ between Django versions and how the view function might need to be adjusted.",
