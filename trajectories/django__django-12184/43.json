This is likely due to changes in how URL parameters are handled in Django 3.0. The current file context and search results focus on URL resolution, specifically on how URL patterns and views are resolved and matched. The key elements to look for are the URL patterns and the view functions, ensuring that the number of expected parameters matches the actual parameters provided by the URL patterns. The provided search results do not directly contain the view code causing the issue, but they provide context on how URL patterns are defined and resolved, which is crucial for understanding and addressing the issue. The relevant code spans identified are from `django/urls/resolvers.py` and `django/contrib/admindocs/views.py`, which deal with URL pattern resolution and extraction of views from URL patterns, respectively. These sections are relevant because they show how views are associated with URL patterns and how those patterns are processed. However, the exact view code causing the TypeError is not present in the search results, so further investigation is likely needed to directly address the issue.",
