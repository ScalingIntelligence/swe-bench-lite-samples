The function starts by checking if the dependent variable is a sequence or a symbol, raising a ValueError otherwise. This is where the issue with unsupported types like f(x) arises. After confirming the types, the function proceeds to substitute the dependent variable into the equation, differentiate it, and solve for the derivative. This part of the code is likely to be involved in the error when trying to use 'Eq' for the equation, as solving it or getting its derivative might fail.
