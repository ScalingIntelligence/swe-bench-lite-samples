These issues are related to how the 'idiff' function handles the input types and their differentiation. From the search results, we can see the 'idiff' function definition, which includes checks for the type of the dependent variable 'y' and raises a ValueError if it's not an x-dependent symbol. This behavior directly relates to the second reported issue regarding 'f(x)'. Additionally, the function's attempt to solve for the derivative at line 'solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0].subs(derivs)' is a likely source for the IndexError mentioned when 'idiff' is used with 'Eq'. Therefore, the identified code span is relevant to addressing both issues reported.",
