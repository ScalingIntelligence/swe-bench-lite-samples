The provided search results contain the implementation of the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. This implementation checks if 'y' is a sequence or a symbol and raises a 'ValueError' if it is not an x-dependent symbol. This aligns with the second error reported in the issue where 'f(x)' is not accepted. The error message 'expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: f(x)' is exactly what is raised in the function. Additionally, the line 'yp = solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0].subs(derivs)' in the function could be related to the 'IndexError' mentioned in the issue, as the error occurs when the list index is out of range in this line. Therefore, the code span labeled 'idiff' is highly relevant to both issues reported.",
