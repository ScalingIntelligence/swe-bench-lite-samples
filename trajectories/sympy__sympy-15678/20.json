The function's logic includes checks for the type of 'y' and raises a ValueError if 'y' is not an x-dependent symbol, which aligns with the error encountered when 'f(x)' is used as 'y'. Additionally, the function attempts to solve for the derivative of the equation with respect to 'x', highlighting the critical part of the code where the error due to unsupported 'Eq' type might occur. This span is crucial for addressing the reported issues as it directly contains the core logic responsible for handling the equation differentiation, thus making it highly relevant to the reported issue.",
