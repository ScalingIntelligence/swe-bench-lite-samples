The search results provide the implementation of the `idiff` function in `sympy/geometry/util.py`, which is highly relevant. The function raises a `ValueError` when `f(x)` is passed, which aligns with the issue description. The `diff` and `expand` functions in `sympy/core/function.py` could be relevant for supporting `Eq` objects and function handling, though their relevance is secondary compared to the primary `idiff` function. The `dsolve` and `classify_ode` functions in `sympy/solvers/ode.py` might also be indirectly relevant for context on how to handle differential equations and classifying ODEs, but they are not directly related to the issue at hand since the issue is specifically about the `idiff` function's limitations.",

The current implementation of 'idiff' in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' fails in these cases due to insufficient checks and handling. The file context provides insights into the existing code related to 'idiff' and functions like 'diff' and 'expand'. Analyzing the new search results, especially the 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' file, revealed relevant functions such as 'dsolve' and its helper functions, which are designed to handle differential equations similarly to 'idiff' but more comprehensively. These functions use advanced techniques and additional arguments to support various forms of equations and functions, which could inspire improvements in 'idiff'. The identified code spans involve function definitions and import statements crucial for understanding how other parts of SymPy handle similar problems and may guide in improving 'idiff' to support the desired functionalities.",
