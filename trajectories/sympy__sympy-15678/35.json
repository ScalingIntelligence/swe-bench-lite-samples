The current context provides the `idiff` function definition and some related spans in `sympy/geometry/util.py`. The new search results include additional code spans that are relevant to differential operations and handling of functions. Specifically, the `Derivative` class and the `diff` function in `sympy/core/function.py` are crucial to understand how differentiation is handled in SymPy. The `BooleanFunction` in `sympy/logic/boolalg.py` is also relevant as it relates to boolean operations, which could be indirectly related to the handling of conditions in the `idiff` function. These new spans help in understanding the broader context of differentiation and how functions are treated, potentially guiding in modifying the `idiff` function to support `Eq` and `f(x)`.",
