The provided code snippet for 'idiff' in sympy/geometry/util.py includes the function definition and its logic. It specifically handles cases where 'y' is a sequence or a Symbol, but it raises an error if 'y' is not an x-dependent symbol, which is likely the reason why 'f(x)' is not supported. Additionally, the line 'yp = solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0].subs(derivs)' could be the source of the 'IndexError' when 'Eq' is passed, as 'solve' might not return any solutions in some cases. This code is directly related to the functionality being discussed in the issue and should be considered relevant.",
