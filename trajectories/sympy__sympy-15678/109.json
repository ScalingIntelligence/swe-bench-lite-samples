However, they do show relevant methods ('solve' and 'dsolve') and functions ('diff') which might be used or need modifications to support 'Eq' and 'f(x)' in 'idiff'. Specifically, 'solve' in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' and 'dsolve' in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' are likely used in solving differential equations, which 'idiff' might rely on. Therefore, these methods could be crucial for addressing the reported issue.
