The errors are indicating problems with differentiation and solving in these specific cases. The error message 'list index out of range' suggests that `solve` is not returning any results, likely due to the specific form of the equation or the way it is being passed. Additionally, the 'expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: f(x)' error implies that the function is looking for a specific type of input. This seems to be a problem in how the function is handling certain types of input and could be related to the logic within the `idiff` function itself. Given the context, the search should focus on the `idiff` function within `sympy/geometry/util.py` and possibly the handling of equations and functions within the core functionality of SymPy, such as in `sympy/core/function.py`.",

'idiff' does not support symbols defined as functions, like 'f(x)'.\n\nTo address these issues, we need to look at the implementation of 'idiff' and understand how it handles incoming equations and symbols. From the search results, we can see that 'idiff' raises a 'ValueError' if the symbol is not x-dependent, which is the scenario reported, specifically with 'f(x)'. Additionally, the traceback indicates an 'IndexError' when 'solve' does not return a solution, which may be related to handling 'Eq' objects.\n\nGiven these points, we should first focus on the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' to identify the parts of the code handling symbol type checking and equation solving. The current implementation of 'idiff' in the search results already shows the logic that is failing, so the relevant parts of the code are the sections that handle the 'y' symbol input and the equation solving step.",
