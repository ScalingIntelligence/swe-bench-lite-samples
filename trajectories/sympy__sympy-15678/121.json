Specifically, it fails to handle equations where the left-hand side is an 'Eq' object, and it also fails to handle derivatives of functions written as 'f(x)' instead of 'y'. To address these issues, I need to locate the 'idiff' function's implementation and possibly related error-handling code. Given the context provided, the 'idiff' function is likely defined in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', but I should also check related files like 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' and 'sympy/core/function.py' for broader functionality or interaction that might be affecting 'idiff'.",
