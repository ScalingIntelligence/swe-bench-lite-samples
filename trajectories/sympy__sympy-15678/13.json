The search results confirm the existence of 'idiff' in the mentioned file and also show the function 'solve' in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' which might be relevant for handling 'Eq' objects. Additionally, the 'diff' function in 'sympy/core/function.py' could be useful for differentiation, which is a key part of 'idiff'. Since the issue involves improving 'idiff' to handle 'Eq' objects and 'f(x)', we need to identify the necessary code spans to understand how these parts of the codebase interact and where improvements could be made.",

The function logic directly deals with differentiating equations and solving for the derivative. However, it faces issues with `Eq` objects and functional expressions like `f(x)`, as evidenced by the reported issues. The file `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` contains the `solve` function, which is crucial for solving equations and is referenced in the `idiff` function. Additionally, `sympy/solvers/ode.py` and `sympy/core/function.py` provide further context on solving differential equations and handling functions, respectively. These files suggest that the context for handling `Eq` objects and functional expressions is widely spread across the codebase, but not all necessary parts are provided in the file context for a comprehensive fix. However, given the identified code, there's enough context to understand the general approach and modify the existing `idiff` function to handle these cases.",
