The current context shows the implementation of the `idiff` function in `sympy/geometry/util.py`. The first issue might be related to the `solve` function used in `idiff` which could potentially not handle `Eq` objects correctly. The second issue might be due to the logic checking for x-dependent symbols. For addressing these issues, we need to look at how `solve`, `diff`, and `subs` are implemented and used in other parts of the codebase. The search results provide insights into these functionalities across different files. Particularly relevant are the implementations of `diff` and `subs` in `sympy/core/expr.py` and `sympy/core/basic.py`, which might influence the behavior of `idiff`. Additionally, understanding how `Eq` objects are typically handled in SymPy, if there are special methods for them, could also be beneficial. The search results do not directly address the handling of `Eq` objects, but they provide foundational understanding of how symbolic substitution and differentiation are managed, which is essential for addressing the reported issues.",

            "scratch_pad": "Upon reviewing the reported issue, it is clear that the idiff function is experiencing issues with handling equations expressed in terms of 'Eq' and functions like 'f(x)' instead of symbols. The two main issues are the IndexError when attempting to differentiate an equation with 'Eq', and the ValueError when attempting to differentiate an equation with a function 'f(x)'. The goal is to identify the relevant code spans that might contribute to these issues and potentially provide insight into how these issues could be addressed.\n\nStarting with the current file context, the idiff function itself is the primary candidate as it contains the logic for implicit differentiation, showcasing how it handles differentiating equations. It raises a ValueError explicitly when encountering a case like 'f(x)', which aligns with the issue described in the reported problem.\n\nReviewing the new search results, several key files and functions stand out that might be relevant to addressing the issues:\n\n1. **idiff**: The implicit differentiation function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' is the primary focus as it directly handles the differentiation that leads to the errors.\n2. **solve**: Functions named 'solve' in 'sympy/matrices/matrices.py' and 'sympy/matrices/sparse.py' might be relevant, though they are typically for solving equations rather than differentiating them. However, understanding how they handle symbolic or functional dependencies might illuminate if they use similar logic that could offer solutions or workarounds for the idiff logic.\n3. **diff**: The 'diff' function in 'sympy/core/function.py' and 'sympy/core/expr.py' is fundamental to differentiation and is likely where calls to 'idiff' or its related methods are made. Reviewing how it handles different forms of expressions like 'Eq' and 'f(x)' could provide valuable insights.\n4. **subs**: The substitution method in 'sympy/core/basic.py' is crucial for handling replacements within expressions. It might influence how 'idiff' substitutes 'f(x)' into its differentiation process, thus indirectly affecting the handling of 'f(x)'-type issues.\n\nThese functions and methods in the new search results are directly related to the issues at hand by either directly handling differentiation or influencing how differentiation is approached in SymPy. Therefore, assessing the implementation of these functions will help in tracing the logic causing the errors and determining where adjustments might be needed to support differentiation involving 'Eq' and 'f(x)'.",

However, specific error handling or robust checks for expected behaviors such as `Eq` or `f(x)` do not appear to be explicitly detailed within this snippet. For deeper understanding and potential fixes, checking how `Eq` and `solve` operate within the context of SymPy's core would be beneficial.
