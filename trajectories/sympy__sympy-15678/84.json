Upon examining the provided code span within the `sympy/geometry/util.py` file, it is evident that this span contains the definition of the `idiff` function. The function raises a `ValueError` if the input `y` is not an `x-dependent symbol(s)`, which directly relates to the second part of the issue where `idiff` does not support `f(x)` instead of `y`. Furthermore, the function attempts to solve the differential equation by differentiating it with respect to `x` and then solving for `dydx`. If no solutions are found, as indicated by the `IndexError` in the reported issue, it results in an out-of-range index error, which aligns with the first part of the issue.
