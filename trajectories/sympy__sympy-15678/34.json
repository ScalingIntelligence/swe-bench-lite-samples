            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue identifies two main problems with the `idiff` function in the SymPy library. The first issue is that `idiff` does not support `Eq`, leading to an IndexError. The second issue is that `idiff` does not support `f(x)` in place of `y`, resulting in a ValueError. Both issues are related to the handling of symbolic expressions and the differentiation process in the `idiff` function.\n\nTo address the first issue, it is necessary to modify the `idiff` function to handle `Eq` objects properly. This might involve extracting the left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation and processing them separately. Additionally, the function should handle the case where no solution is found without raising an IndexError.\n\nFor the second issue, the function needs to accept `f(x)` as a valid dependent variable. This might involve enhancing the check for x-dependent symbols and ensuring that the function can handle more complex expressions involving functions of `x`.\n\nGiven the search results, the code span identified in the `idiff` function within `sympy/geometry/util.py` directly addresses both issues. The current implementation of `idiff` does not properly handle `Eq` objects and `f(x)`, as evidenced by the error messages in the reported issue. Therefore, the provided code span is relevant and should be considered for modifications to correct the identified issues.",
