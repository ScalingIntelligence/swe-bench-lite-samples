Both issues point to needed improvements in the `idiff` function within the `sympy.geometry.util` module to better handle these cases. Therefore, the primary focus of the search should be the `idiff` function in `sympy.geometry.util.py`, looking specifically for modifications to handle `Eq` objects and functional derivatives.",
