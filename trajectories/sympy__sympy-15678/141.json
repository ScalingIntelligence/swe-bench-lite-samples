Both issues seem to be related to the handling of equations and symbolic differentiation. First, I will need to identify files and functions related to symbolic differentiation, particularly those dealing with the 'diff' function and equation solving in SymPy. Secondly, I'll search for the 'idiff' function itself to inspect its logic and how it handles different inputs. Lastly, I'll look into any related examples or test cases to understand the expected usage and failure points.",

The existing implementation of 'idiff' does handle certain cases correctly but fails in others, as indicated by the tracebacks. Looking at the current context, it is evident that the 'idiff' implementation is in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', where it checks for the type of 'y' and raises a ValueError if it's not an x-dependent symbol. To address the issues, modifications need to be made to handle 'Eq' objects and allow for 'f(x)' as a valid argument.\n\nReviewing the new search results, there are several relevant sections.\n\n1. In 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' under span 'solve', there is a comprehensive function 'solve' that handles the solving of equations which could be leveraged to handle cases where 'idiff' might currently fail.\n\n2. Also in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py', span '_solve' and '_solve_system' provide underlying functionality for solving equations and systems of equations respectively, which could be used or adapted for handling the new requirements in 'idiff'.\n\n3. Span '_invert' in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' is particularly relevant as it is a method for inverting equations, likely useful for handling both 'Eq' objects and functions like 'f(x)' in the context of 'idiff'.\n\nThese functions suggest that modifications could be made within the existing 'idiff' function by enhancing its ability to defer to these solver methods when encountering equations or functions it cannot directly handle. This approach would extend the capabilities of 'idiff' without needing to rewrite its core logic completely.",

The first problem is that `idiff` does not support equations in the form of `Eq`, and the second is that it does not support expressions like `f(x)` instead of `y`. The provided `file_context` contains the current implementation of `idiff`. Upon examining the new search results, the same `idiff` implementation is found, which confirms that the issue lies within this function. To address the reported issues, modifications should be made to the `idiff` function to handle equations given as `Eq` objects and to support expressions involving functions like `f(x)`.\n\n- The current implementation of `idiff` directly checks for symbols and raises a `ValueError` if it encounters a function-dependent symbol, which is the cause of the second problem. This should be adjusted to handle such cases.\n- The function should also be able to differentiate equations given as `Eq` objects. This could involve converting the equation to a standard form before processing.\n\nGiven the above, the identified relevant code spans are within the `idiff` function definition.",
