The provided code span from 'sympy/geometry/util.py' directly addresses these issues. Firstly, the function correctly raises an error when 'y' is not an x-dependent symbol, which handles the case of 'f(x)' being passed. Secondly, the function does not currently incorporate handling for 'Eq' objects, which would likely require a modification to recognize equation objects and extract the left-hand and right-hand sides for differentiation. As the function stands, it assumes straightforward expressions rather than equations, indicating it lacks support for 'Eq'. The provided span is thus highly relevant as it contains the core implementation of 'idiff', which would need adjustments to support 'Eq' and handle functional dependencies more gracefully.",
