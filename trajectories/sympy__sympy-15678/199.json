The error traces indicate problems with the `idiff` function in `sympy/geometry/util.py`. Additionally, the error messages suggest that the function fails to recognize certain expected formats for symbols and equations, leading to `IndexError` and `ValueError`. To address this, we need to locate and focus on the `idiff` function within the relevant files. Although some files (like `sympy/solvers/ode.py` and `sympy/integrals/risch.py`) are not directly linked to `idiff`, they might still contain relevant logic for differential equations and expressions. Further, the `exp` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` may also be involved in the expression handling.",

Secondly, it does not support expressions involving `f(x)` instead of `y`. The tracebacks provided in the issue indicate two specific errors: an `IndexError` when trying to solve for `dydx` in `idiff`, and a `ValueError` when `idiff` encounters `f(x)` as an argument. To address these issues, the relevant code spans need to be identified where these problems might originate. The search results include `sympy/geometry/util.py` which contains the definition of `idiff`. This function is responsible for implicitly differentiating equations. The spans identified in this file are directly relevant to the reported issue as they involve the logic for handling equations and differentiating them implicitly. Additionally, the file `sympy/solvers/ode.py` contains functions related to solving ordinary differential equations but does not contain a direct match to the `idiff` function's logic mentioned in the issue. The other files, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` and `sympy/solvers/ode.py`, though related to functions and solving ODEs respectively, do not contain code directly linked to the `idiff` function's implementation.\n\n**Decision Process: Identifying the most relevant code spans**\n1. **sympy/geometry/util.py**: This file contains the `idiff` function where the errors are originating. The code span in question involves handling the differentiation of equations implicitly. This is the most relevant code span as it directly addresses the issues reported. Other code spans in this file, such as handling might contribute to a broader understanding of the function, but are less directly relevant to fixing the reported issues in `idiff`.\n2. **sympy/solvers/ode.py**: While this file deals with ODEs, the code spans here (`dsolve`, `classify_ode`) are not directly related to the implementation of `idiff`. They are more about solving ODEs rather than differentiating them implicitly.\n3. **sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py**: This file deals with exponential functions and might be indirectly relevant to `idiff` when handling equations involving `exp`. However, the relevance here is less pronounced compared to the direct relevance found in `sympy/geometry/util.py`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans in `sympy/geometry/util.py` are the most relevant to the reported issue, as they involve the core logic of the `idiff` function which is directly impacted by the issues described. The other spans, while they could contribute contextually to the overall understanding of SymPy's function and solver architecture, do not directly relate to the `idiff` function's current implementation issues emphasized in the reported issue.",
