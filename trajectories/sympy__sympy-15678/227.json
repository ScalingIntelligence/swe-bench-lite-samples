Upon examining the provided code spans in the file context and search results, the majority of relevant code is found in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file context, specifically in the span labeled 'idiff'. The search results do not contain new code spans that directly address the issues with 'idiff'. Thus, the focus remains on the existing implementation in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. The task is to enhance this existing function to properly handle 'Eq' objects and functions like 'f(x)' instead of just symbols like 'y'.",
