To address these issues, we need to look at the 'idiff' function in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file and understand how it processes the input expressions and variables. The current implementation checks for specific types of inputs and raises errors if the inputs do not meet the expected format. This suggests that adjustments may be needed in the way 'idiff' handles 'Eq' objects and generic functions. The search results include the 'idiff' function definition, which is directly related to the issue. Additionally, the 'Function' class in 'sympy/core/function.py' is relevant because it deals with symbolic functions and their differentiation, which is a key part of the 'idiff' functionality. The spans within 'Function' that evaluate derivatives and handle function differentiation will likely need modification to accommodate 'f(x)' and similar cases.
