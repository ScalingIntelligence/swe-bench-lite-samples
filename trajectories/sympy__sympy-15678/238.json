The error tracebacks indicate specific lines in the `idiff` function that raise exceptions. By analyzing the provided `idiff` function code, we can identify the exact lines causing the issues: 1) The `IndexError` is likely caused by the `solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0].subs(derivs)` line when no solutions are found. 2) The `ValueError` is raised in the `idiff` function when `expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: f(x)`. These issues suggest that the `idiff` function needs to handle `Eq` objects and arbitrary functions more gracefully. The search results include the `idiff` function definition in `sympy/geometry/util.py`, which is directly relevant to addressing these issues. Additionally, the `diff` function in `sympy/core/function.py` and other related imports in `sympy/solvers/ode.py` might be useful for enhancing `idiff` to handle `f(x)` correctly. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the reported issues are those containing the `idiff` function and any additional related functions or imports necessary for supporting `Eq` and `f(x)`.",

The search results provide insights into the 'diff' function and its handling of derivatives, which is relevant to fixing the 'IndexError' in 'idiff'. Additionally, the 'dsolve' and 'classify_ode' functions, which deal with solving and classifying ordinary differential equations, respectively, might offer insights into handling 'Eq' objects and expressions like 'f(x)'.
