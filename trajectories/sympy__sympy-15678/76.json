The tracebacks provided show specific errors when trying to use `idiff` with these cases. The primary task is to identify the relevant code spans that deal with these issues within the `idiff` function implementation itself, as it seems likely that modifications are needed to address these shortcomings.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, the focus initially lands on the `idiff` function defined in `sympy/geometry/util.py`. This function is central to the issue since it contains the logic for implicit differentiation, and the errors are directly related to its implementation. The code spans enclosed with `<span id='idiff'>` provide a clear view of this function. Notably, the checks for `Symbol` types and the use of `solve` within the function seem pertinent to the errors reported.\n\nAs I analyze this function, I observe the following critical areas:\n- The handling of `Symbol` types and raising an error if the symbol is not x-dependent.\n- The usage of `solve` on a differentiated equation to find `dydx`, which throws an `IndexError` when no solution is found.\n\nGiven the detailed context of the issue and the location of `idiff` within `sympy/geometry/util.py`, I am confident that the relevant code spans involve the `idiff` function itself. This conclusion does not require further examination of other parts of the codebase since the core of the issue lies within the `idiff` implementation.",
