The error messages indicate that the function is not equipped to handle these cases, leading to IndexError and ValueError respectively. Given the tracebacks and the nature of the issues, it's likely that the idiff function in sympy/geometry/util.py needs to be adjusted to handle these different input types gracefully. Additionally, understanding how other functions like dsolve in sympy/solvers/ode.py handle similar inputs could provide insights into potential fixes or patterns to apply.",

This function is supposed to handle differential equations and seems to fail when given equations wrapped in `Eq` objects or when the dependent variable is a function `f(x)` rather than a symbol. The code span labeled 'idiff' clearly shows the implementation of `idiff`, which includes checks for symbols in the dependent variable and attempts to solve the differential equation. The Traceback in the reported issue suggests that the error occurs due to an assumption in the code that `y` must be a symbol dependent on `x`, which fails when `y` is actually a function `f(x)`. Additionally, the issue with `Eq` might stem from how the equation is processed within `idiff`, as the function does not seem to be equipped to handle equations directly in the form `Eq(y*exp(y), x*exp(x))`.",

The search for relevant code snippets, particularly focusing on how dsolve handles similar inputs, did not yield directly usable results. Therefore, the next logical step is to analyze the idiff function itself to identify where and how these issues occur, and to consider potential modifications. The function currently raises a ValueError when encountering 'f(x)' and an IndexError when trying to differentiate an equation not in the specified format. Enhancing the function to accept Eq objects and properly manage functions as dependent variables will likely involve adjustments to the input checks, the substitution mechanism, and the differentiation logic.",

The current context provided the implementation of `idiff` which already addresses the first identified problem with the `IndexError` being raised due to the list index out of range. The new search results repeat the same context, but this confirms the focus should be on improving the handling of `Eq` objects and supporting functions like `f(x)`. To address the issue with `Eq` objects, we need to ensure that the function can differentiate equations without raising an `IndexError`. For the support of `f(x)`, the function should be able to handle symbols that are functions of `x` without raising a `ValueError`. The current implementation already raises a `ValueError` specifically for `f(x)`, so the code span containing this logic is relevant.",
