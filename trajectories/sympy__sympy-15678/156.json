This prompts a need to modify the 'idiff' function to handle these cases properly. The current implementation of 'idiff' in the sympy/geometry/util.py file is analyzed. It is found that the function either fails with an IndexError when trying to solve an equation with Eq or raises a ValueError for an x-dependent symbol like f(x). To address these issues, the function likely needs to be enhanced to correctly identify and process these types of inputs. The implementation of 'solve' and 'diff' functions from sympy/core/function.py could be relevant, particularly the 'diff' function, which is responsible for differentiating equations. Considering the context of the issue, the identified span in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' directly relates to the 'idiff' function's operation and thus seems highly relevant to the issue resolution. The spans in 'sympy/core/function.py' identifying 'diff' and 'expand' functions could also be helpful, but primarily as supporting functions used within potential fixes applied to 'idiff'.",
