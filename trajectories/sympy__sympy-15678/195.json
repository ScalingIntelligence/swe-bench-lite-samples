This function handles the differentiation of an equation with respect to 'x', where 'y' is dependent on 'x'. The function includes error handling for cases where 'y' is not x-dependent, matching the error for 'f(x)' reported in the issue. Additionally, the traceback for 'Eq(y*exp(y), x*exp(x))' suggests an 'IndexError', likely due to 'solve' not finding any solutions in 'eq.diff(x)', which points to a logical failure in the current implementation.
