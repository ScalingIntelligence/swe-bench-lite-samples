Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the key elements**: The key elements in the issue are 'idiff', 'Eq', and 'f(x)'. These are the main points of concern as they represent the functionality that is currently not supported or causing errors.\n\n2. **Review the 'idiff' code span**: The 'idiff' code span contains the implementation of the 'idiff' function. This is directly relevant as it will help in understanding how 'idiff' processes its inputs and where it might fail for 'Eq' or 'f(x)'.\n\n3. **Other relevant code spans**: Although the 'diff' and 'expand' functions in 'sympy/core/function.py' are related to differentiation and equation manipulation, they do not directly address the specific issues with 'idiff' as reported. The other spans in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' relate to solving ordinary differential equations but do not directly contribute to understanding the 'idiff' issue.\n\n4. **Relevance decision**: Since the 'idiff' code span is the only one closely tied to the reported issue, it is the most relevant for addressing the problems mentioned (i.e., handling 'Eq' and 'f(x)').

The relevant sections to address the reported issues would be the handling of `Eq` and the support for `f(x)`. The `sympy/core/relational.py` section provides insights into the `Eq` functionality, which can be used to enhance `idiff`. However, there isn't direct code in the search results that specifically addresses the issue with `idiff` not supporting `f(x)`.

The issues raised, such as `idiff` not supporting `Eq` objects and handling expressions like `f(x)`, suggest areas of improvement that could involve modifying `idiff` to process `Eq` objects directly and expand its capability to handle functions like `f(x)`. The presence of the `Eq` class in the file context indicates that it is possible to integrate support for `Eq` objects into the `idiff` function by modifying the function to recognize and process these objects more effectively. Additionally, the code for `Eq` includes detailed handling of symbolic equations, which could be leveraged to enhance `idiff`'s capabilities. However, while the main components for addressing the issues are present, specific modifications to `idiff` itself to handle `Eq` and `f(x)` directly are not detailed in the provided context.
