This requires examining the implementation of `idiff` and related functions in SymPy's codebase. Additionally, the error messages suggest that there might be issues with how `idiff` handles certain inputs, particularly when it comes to differentiating equations. A comprehensive search should include focusing on the `idiff` function itself, along with any functions or classes that it interacts with, such as `solve` or `diff`. Furthermore, looking into the handling of `Eq` and functions like `f(x)` within the `idiff` function is essential.",

The provided search results contain the implementation of the `idiff` function from the `sympy/geometry/util.py` file. This function is responsible for implicit differentiation and its current implementation doesn't handle `Eq` objects as it uses `solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0]` which will not work if `eq` is an `Eq` object. Furthermore, the function raises a `ValueError` if `y` is not an `x`-dependent symbol, which explains the error when `f(x)` is passed as `y`. Based on this, the code span identified as 'idiff' is directly related to the issue reported.
