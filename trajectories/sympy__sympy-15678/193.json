Specifically, the function raises a ValueError when encountering a function like f(x), indicating it expects x-dependent symbols. This aligns with the second issue reported. Additionally, the IndexError encountered when using Eq suggests that the function might not be handling the results of 'solve' robustly, possibly due to an empty list or unexpected structure.\n\nThese issues indicate that the reported problems are indeed valid and pertinent to the provided 'idiff' function. The function's current logic needs adjustments to handle Eq objects appropriately and to manage inputs better where functions like f(x) are expected.",
