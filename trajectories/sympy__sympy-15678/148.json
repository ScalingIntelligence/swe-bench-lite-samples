I analyzed the existing code for idiff and found that it raises a ValueError if the symbol provided (y) is not x-dependent. This directly relates to the second part of the issue where the function does not handle f(x). Additionally, the first part of the issue where idiff does not support Eq, could be due to how the function handles differential equations. Given the tracebacks, the error handling and the logic for identifying dependent variables in the code are highly relevant to address the reported issues. However, there is a lack of context regarding the specific handling of Eq in the given code snippet. Since the analysis of the relevant code span is complete and encompasses the areas where the reported issue might originate, I believe the identified code spans are pertinent.",

However, it does not handle the Eq object or the case where the dependent variable is a function of x (like f(x)).\n\nIn the search results, we see several files and spans that are relevant:\n\n- sympy/core/relational.py: This file contains the implementation of the Eq (Equality) class, which is necessary for correctly handling the Eq object in the idiff function.\n\n- sympy/solvers/solvers.py: This file contains various solver functions, which might help in handling custom functions like f(x) in idiff.\n\n- sympy/core/expr.py: This file contains the Expr class, which is the base class for expression handling in SymPy. Understanding how Expr objects are handled might be useful for the function handling in idiff.\n\n- sympy/core/function.py: This file deals with function-related operations, which are crucial for handling f(x) in idiff.\n\nGiven these contexts, the identified spans would guide the modification of the idiff function in sympy/geometry/util.py to correctly handle the Eq objects and the dependent variable as a function of x (like f(x)).",

I will start by identifying relevant code spans from the search results. The main target areas are the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', the 'Eq' class in 'sympy/core/relational.py', and possibly the '_solve' function in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py'. I should also consider 'Lambda' and its methods in 'sympy/core/function.py' for any potential inconsistencies.\n\nThe 'idiff' function, located in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', is involved in differential calculations and needs to accommodate 'Eq' objects as well as handle 'f(x)' patterns. The 'Eq' class, defined in 'sympy/core/relational.py', provides the functionality for equations and equivalences, so this class's methods related to equation solving (e.g., 'equals' and '__new__') are crucial.\n\nThe '_solve' function in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' is responsible for solving equations, so modifications here might be necessary to support 'idiff' more effectively. Additionally, the methods of the 'Lambda' class in 'sympy/core/function.py' should be checked for any compatibility issues with 'idiff'.\n\nI will also keep an eye on any utility functions like '_simplify_variable_coeff' in 'sympy/solvers/pde.py' because they might indirectly affect the functioning of 'idiff'.\n\nOverall, the main focus should be on enhancing the 'idiff' function to handle 'Eq' and 'f(x)' correctly, possibly by making changes to the 'Eq' class's methods and extending the functionality of the '_solve' or similar solver functions.",

Analyzing the provided file context, it's evident that the current implementation of 'idiff' in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' does not explicitly handle 'Eq' objects and may not accommodate the substitution of 'f(x)' in the same context the function is defined. However, other parts of the context, such as 'sympy/core/relational.py' and 'sympy/core/expr.py', illustrate how 'Equality' objects and general expressions are handled in SymPy, which could potentially guide how such enhancements could be made to 'idiff'. Furthermore, 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' provides a broader view of how various solver functionalities are implemented in SymPy, potentially providing deeper insights into integrating or reusing functionalities to extend the 'idiff' function to handle the reported issues.",
            "search_suggestions": "Further exploration into how 'Eq' objects and dependent variables like 'f(x)' are treated in other parts of SymPy such as in equation solvers and relational expression handlers could provide more specific clues and possibly reusable code or logic for enhancing the 'idiff' function. Additionally, understanding how other functions handle the differentiation of equations or expressions, especially in a setup where 'idiff' needs to be extended, might also offer useful patterns or techniques applicable to 'idiff's case."
