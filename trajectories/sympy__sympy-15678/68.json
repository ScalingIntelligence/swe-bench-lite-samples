The provided code in the search results contains the 'idiff' function, which is exactly what we need to address the issues. The function checks for x-dependent symbols and uses 'solve' to find derivatives, which aligns with the expected functionality. The errors in the reported issue correspond to the 'IndexError' when trying to access an element in an empty list after solving the differential equation (indicating issues with the equation format or the solve method) and the 'ValueError' due to expecting x-dependent symbols but receiving a function instead. This matches the code span labeled with 'idiff', making this span highly relevant to addressing the reported issues. Therefore, the identified code span is 'idiff'.",
