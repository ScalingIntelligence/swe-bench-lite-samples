The relevant files and functions to look into are clearly in the `sympy/geometry/util.py` file, specifically the `idiff` function, and potentially related functions like `solve` and `diff` which seem to be used within `idiff`. The `idiff` function is trying to handle differentiations where the derivative relationships (like `dy/dx`) need to be inferred directly from the given equations rather than having those derivatives explicitly provided. Therefore, it's essential to check the logic involving these operations and potentially how error handling (like the `IndexError` and `ValueError`) is implemented.",

Upon analyzing the provided code span from the 'idiff' function in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file, it appears that the function currently expects 'y' to be a symbol dependent on 'x' and raises a ValueError if it's not. This explains the error when 'f(x)' is used instead of 'y'. The other issue with 'Eq' not being handled might be related to the section where the derivative is being solved. Given the information, it seems the existing code might need adjustments to properly handle 'Eq' objects and function-dependent variables like 'f(x)'.",

This can guide us in how to adapt or expand the logic in the 'idiff' function. Since the current context does not specify the use of 'Eq' or 'f(x)' explicitly in any other part of the provided 'idiff' function, it leads us to believe that more comprehensive searches across related modules or files handling differential equations are necessary. The goal is to gather examples and implementations that can be directly or indirectly adapted into 'idiff' to mitigate its current problems. The strategy should focus on modules likely dealing with symbolic equations ('Eq') and functions ('f(x)') differentiated in a context similar to 'idiff'.",

These could provide insights and utilities that might be beneficial for enhancing the 'idiff' function. These findings suggest that the 'idiff' function should be updated to parse 'Eq' objects and handle 'f(x)' appropriately by possibly converting 'Eq' to expressions and managing function applications correctly. Given that no direct relevant results were found in the broader search for handling 'Eq' and 'f(x)' in a differential context, it appears that further targeted inspection of the identified relevant files like sympy/solvers/ode.py might yield more specific techniques and modifications to adapt within the 'idiff' function for effective support of 'Eq' and 'f(x)'.",

First, `idiff` does not support equations in the form of `Eq(y*exp(y), x*exp(x))`. Second, it does not support using `f(x)` instead of `y`. The existing code in the `idiff` function already handles the detection of x-dependent symbols and the substitution of these symbols with their functional forms. The error tracebacks indicate that the function fails when trying to solve for the derivative in these specific cases. Therefore, the relevant code spans should focus on the `idiff` function definition where these issues can be addressed. To fix the first issue, the function should be able to handle equations defined with `Eq`. For the second issue, the function should be able to treat `f(x)` as a valid x-dependent symbol. Since the existing code already covers the main functionality of `idiff`, the identified spans should include the entire `idiff` function to ensure that any modifications made to address the reported issues are applied correctly.",
