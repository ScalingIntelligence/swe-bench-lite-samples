The current file context includes the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', showcasing its implementation. The new search results primarily list additional functions and imports relevant to solving ODEs, such as 'dsolve', 'classify_ode', and various ODE solution methods. These likely are indirectly relevant as they could be used to fix or improve the 'idiff' function. However, they do not directly address the issues mentioned in the report. Therefore, while the search results are relevant for a broader understanding of the context in which 'idiff' operates, they do not directly solve the issues within 'idiff' itself. For now, since the issues reside within 'idiff', I will only consider 'sympy/geometry/util.py' as relevant.",
