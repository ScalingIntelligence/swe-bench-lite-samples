From the search results, the function 'idiff' is found in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. The implementation of 'idiff' directly handles the first problem by checking for the types and raising an error if the types are not as expected. This confirms relevance to the issue. The second problem is also handled in the 'idiff' function by checking if the symbols are dependent on 'x' and raising an error if not. The 'diff' function in 'sympy/core/function.py' is also relevant as it handles differentiation, which is a key part of the functionality needed to fix the issues in 'idiff'. The 'ode.py' file, especially the 'dsolve' and 'classify_ode' functions, are likely relevant for understanding how to extend 'idiff' to support more complex functions like 'f(x)'. However, detailed code in these sections is not directly related to the 'idiff' issue. Therefore, focusing on 'idiff' in 'util.py' and 'diff' in 'function.py' is sufficient to address the immediate issues without needing further detailed analysis from 'ode.py'.",
