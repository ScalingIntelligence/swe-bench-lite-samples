Specifically, it doesn't support 'Eq' objects and it doesn't support passing a function 'f(x)' instead of 'y'. From the provided search results, the relevant code span is the implementation of the 'idiff' function itself. This function is responsible for implicit differentiation and contains the logic for handling the input equations and symbols. The identified section of the code includes checks for the type of 'y' and raises an error if 'y' is not an x-dependent symbol, which directly correlates with the issue of not supporting 'f(x)' as input. Additionally, the function attempts to solve the differentiated equation but can raise an 'IndexError' if it fails to find a solution, which is likely what happens when 'Eq' objects are used. Therefore, this span of code is highly relevant to the reported issue as it directly involves the part of the code that needs correction to handle 'Eq' objects and 'f(x)'.",

The file context is relevant and identifies the critical parts of the codebase that need attention to fix the issues.

Additionally, the function uses `solve` and `diff` methods, which could fail under certain conditions, leading to errors like `IndexError`.

The presence of a `solve` function call indicates a critical step in the process, where the derivative of the equation is solved for, potentially leading to the `IndexError: list index out of range` if no solution is found. Similarly, accessing `[0]` directly suggests vulnerability to cases where the derivative might not exist or be implicitly assumed by the function's logic. Diving deeper into the `solve` and `diff` methods implementations and how they handle or manage symbolic equations (`Eq`) and expressions like functions (`f(x)`) could reveal why the execution path fails in the reported scenarios.

While the search results did not directly address these issues, they highlight relevant modules like `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/logic/boolalg.py` that deal with differentiation and Boolean functions. To address the reported issues, we need to improve `idiff`'s capability to handle `Eq` and `f(x)` inputs.

The relevant code spans provided in the file context and search results both point to the 'idiff' function in the same file. This indicates that the search task is already complete, and the relevant code spans detail the exact implementation of the 'idiff' function where both issues are present. The function raises a 'ValueError' if 'y' is not an 'x-dependent symbol' and attempts to solve for the derivative of the given equation.
