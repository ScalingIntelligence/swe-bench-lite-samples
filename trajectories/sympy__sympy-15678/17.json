The search results contain a relevant part of the code in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' where the 'idiff' function is defined. The function checks for the type of 'y' and raises an error if 'y' is not an x-dependent symbol, which would be the case for 'f(x)'. Additionally, the function uses 'solve' to handle the derivative of the equation, suggesting a problem with improper handling of equations defined in 'Eq' objects. Therefore, the identified code span in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' seems relevant to both issues, needing adjustments to manage 'Eq' objects and 'f(x)' as a symbol directly without raising an error. The search for relevant code can be considered complete since the identified code span addresses both concerns raised in the issue.",
