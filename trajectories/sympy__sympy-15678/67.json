The issue specifically mentions problems with 'idiff' not supporting 'Eq' and 'f(x)' instead of 'y'. We need to find the relevant code spans that define or reference 'idiff' and also identify any related functions or classes that might need adjustments to support the new functionalities.\n\n1. Analyzing the reported issue:\n   - 'idiff' does not support 'Eq' and 'f(x)' instead of 'y'.\n   - Both elements need correction.\n\n2. Review the current file context: No relevant code identified yet.\n\n3. Process new search results:\n   - The 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' contains 'solve' function which might be relevant for solving the 'Eq' related issues.\n   - The 'sympy/core/function.py' contains 'diff' function which is likely used in 'idiff'.\n   - The 'sympy/geometry/util.py' contains the actual definition of 'idiff', which is the key function we are looking for.\n   - The 'sympy/holonomic/holonomic.py' contains 'HolonomicFunction' class with a 'diff' method, possibly relevant due to its name.\n   \n4. Identify relevant code spans:\n   - 'idiff' function definition in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'.\n   - 'solve' function in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' - could be related to solving 'Eq' instances.\n   - 'diff' function in 'sympy/core/function.py' - could be related to handling differential operations within 'idiff'.\n\n5. Evaluate relevance:\n   - The 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' is directly related.\n   - The 'solve' function in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' might have relevance as it could handle the 'Eq' instances.\n   - The 'diff' function in 'sympy/core/function.py' is closely related as it performs differentiation similar to 'idiff'.\n\nConclusion: The identified code spans in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py', and 'sympy/core/function.py' are relevant to the reported issue regarding 'idiff'.",

The issue mentions two specific problems: 'idiff' not supporting the 'Eq' class and not handling 'f(x)' properly. Upon examining the 'idiff' function, it is evident that it does not explicitly handle or check for instances of 'Eq', nor does it have specific handling for a function like 'f(x)' without additional context. The code in 'idiff' is part of a larger system involving symbolic mathematics and implicit differentiation, which suggests that the fix or adjustment to handle 'Eq' and 'f(x)' would involve modifying this function or adding necessary checks.
