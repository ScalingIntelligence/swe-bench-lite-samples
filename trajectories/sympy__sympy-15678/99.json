The stack traces indicate specific lines within the `idiff` function where errors occur. The function is likely to be the primary focus for fixing these issues, as it seems to have specific handling for derivatives and equations, which is where the problems are manifesting. The `solve` function from `sympy.solvers` also appears to be involved in the error trace, suggesting that the inability to solve for derivatives properly might be at the core of the issue. The `diff` function from `sympy.core.function` is also relevant, as it is central to the functionality of differentiating equations. Investigating how these functions interact and how they handle the specific inputs given in the issue will be crucial to resolving the problems.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue points to two main problems with the 'idiff' function in the SymPy library:\n1. 'idiff' does not support the input of an equation in the form of 'Eq(y*exp(y), x*exp(x))', which is a symbolic equation in SymPy. This leads to an 'IndexError' due to an attempt to access an element out of the list range.\n2. 'idiff' does not support expressions involving functions (like f(x)) instead of symbols directly dependent on x. This results in a 'ValueError' indicating that the function expects an x-dependent symbol but receives a function instead.\n\nReviewing the 'idiff' function in the search results, it is clear that these problems arise due to how the function processes its inputs and handles the differentiation of non-symbolic dependent variables. The current implementation does not anticipate the use of 'Eq' directly, nor does it correctly manage dependencies on functions rather than simple symbols.\n\nThe solution to the problem seems to involve modifying the 'idiff' function to better accommodate SymPy equations ('Eq') and to handle dependencies on functions of x, rather than just simple symbolic dependencies. This would likely require changes to the way the function interprets input expressions and how it solves for the derivative in differing contexts.\n\nSince 'idiff' is the primary function under discussion and already identified in the search results, it directly addresses the reported issue without needing further navigation in the codebase. As such, the search task can be considered complete based on the identified function and the apparent nature of the issues described.",
