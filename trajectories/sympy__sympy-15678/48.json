The reported issue includes specific examples of these failures, and the traceback suggests that the function is not prepared to deal with these inputs. The current implementation raises errors due to the way it checks and processes the input symbols and equations. Notably, it throws an 'IndexError' when trying to solve for the derivative in one case and a 'ValueError' in another, indicating that the function lacks the capability to handle input in these specific formats. By examining the 'idiff' function in the provided search results, it's evident that this is the main function referenced in the issue, and it needs modifications to support 'Eq' and 'f(x)' inputs correctly. This function's relevance is clear as it directly corresponds to the functionality described in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code span is the entire 'idiff' function definition.",

The search results show a broad set of functions and utilities related to solving ODEs, which could be pertinent if the goal was to enhance `idiff` capabilities. However, the specific changes needed are not addressed by the found functions. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on improving `idiff` itself and ensuring it handles `Eq` and `f(x)` correctly seems crucial. The current file context already shows the problem areas in `idiff`, and new search results don't provide specific additional code to rectify these issues.
