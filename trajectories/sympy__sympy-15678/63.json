The tracebacks indicate that the errors originate from `sympy/geometry/util.py`, which is likely the main file containing the `idiff` function. To address these specific issues, it's crucial to pinpoint the exact code segments that handle these conditions within `idiff` and possibly related functions or helpers. Additionally, examining the `solve` function and its interactions within `idiff` is necessary, as suggested by the traceback.",
