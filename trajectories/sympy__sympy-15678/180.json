The provided search result includes the relevant `idiff` function from `sympy/geometry/util.py`. The function's code is analyzed to understand how it processes input and what errors it currently throws. The code checks if `y` is a sequence or a dependent symbol and raises a ValueError if `y` is neither. This explains the error when `f(x)` is passed. The IndexError could be due to the solve function failing to find a solution when given an Eq object, which isn't explicitly handled in the current implementation.
