Error messages suggest there are problems when trying to differentiate equations directly using 'Eq' and when using 'f(x)' as a dependent variable. The primary file identified as relevant is 'sympy/geometry/util.py' which contains the definition of 'idiff'. Other files involve core function manipulation, ODE solving, and examples of differential equations usage. Since the issue is specifically with 'idiff', a detailed search within 'sympy/geometry/util.py' for the 'idiff' function and its related error handling is necessary. Additionally, a search for the 'Eq' function in 'sympy/core/function.py' to understand how 'idiff' interacts with it might reveal the necessary corrections.",

The code provided in the search results exactly pertains to the `idiff` function, which involves parsing equations, determining the appropriate derivative, and handling exceptions like the IndexError and ValueError mentioned in the issue. The code effectively checks for x-dependent symbols and raises an error if an unsupported symbol type is encountered, which directly addresses one part of the issue regarding handling of `f(x)`. Additionally, the code includes logic for determining derivatives, which is relevant for supporting the use of `Eq` once adapted. Thus, this code is highly relevant to resolving both issues reported, lacking support for `Eq` and `f(x)` in the `idiff` function.",
