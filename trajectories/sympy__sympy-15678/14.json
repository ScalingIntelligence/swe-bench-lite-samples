Both of these issues suggest that the current implementation of 'idiff' is not fully compatible with all forms of input equations and symbols. The current context is empty, meaning no relevant code has been identified yet. The search results include the definition of 'idiff' in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', which is directly relevant to the reported issue as it contains the code that is failing. Additionally, there are other sections of code that could potentially be related, such as the 'diff' function in 'sympy/core/function.py' and the 'dsolve' function in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py'. However, the primary focus should be on the 'idiff' function since it is the direct source of the reported errors.",
