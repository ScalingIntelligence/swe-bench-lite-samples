The key is to correct how `idiff` handles equations that are instances of `Eq` and how it manages functions like `f(x)` as the dependent variable.\n\nExamining the provided code, especially in `sympy/geometry/util.py`, reveals the `idiff` function's implementation. This function is responsible for implicit differentiation and initial checks on the types of `y` and `x`. The error arising from `idiff` trying to handle `Eq` and `f(x)` suggests that these are not being properly discerned or handled in the differentiation process.\n\nThe analysis of the code spanned identifies:\n1. In the `idiff` function, there is a `solve` function used to retrieve the derivative's value. The error occurs because the list index is out of range, suggesting that the equation could not be solved for the derivative directly, especially when `Eq` or `f(x)` are involved.\n2. There is a specific error message relating to `x-dependent symbol(s)` which is triggered when `f(x)` is passed as `y`. This indicates that the function is expecting `y` to be a symbol explicitly dependent on `x` but fails to recognize `f(x)` as such.\n\nThese observations point to the specific sections of the code that need to be adjusted to support `Eq` and `f(x)`. The task is to improve the logic within these parts to handle these cases more gracefully and correctly identify and differentiate expressions involving `Eq` and `f(x)`.",
