From the search results, it became clear that the relevant code spans are located in two primary files: 'sympy/geometry/util.py' and 'sympy/solvers/ode.py'. In 'sympy/geometry/util.py', the idiff function is directly related to the reported issue. This function handles the implicit differentiation and is currently causing the reported errors when receiving specific inputs. On the other hand, 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' contains a variety of functions that are related to ordinary differential equations, including those dealing with systems of equations and various types of ODE classification methods. Interestingly, some functions in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' support Wild type arguments, suggesting they could handle more generic or pattern-based inputs like 'f(x)'. Taking these observations into consideration, I decided to isolate the idiff function from 'sympy/geometry/util.py' as a primary focus for addressing the reported issues since it directly handles the problematic cases. Additionally, further modifications might be needed in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py', particularly around handling more generic inputs and possibly incorporating Eq type expressions.",

The 'idiff' function uses 'solve' to find the derivative, which may not handle 'Eq' instances correctly. Additionally, the function checks if the 'y' parameter is a symbol and not a function, thus failing when 'f(x)' is passed. The 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' file includes imports that could potentially be used to improve the 'idiff' function to support 'Eq' instances and function differentiation.

Given the context provided in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', 'sympy/solvers/ode.py', and 'sympy/core/function.py', a more comprehensive examination of how `idiff` might integrate or adapt functionalities from these sections of the codebase is necessary. Specifically, the `Derivative` class within 'sympy/core/function.py' might be utilized or extended in `idiff` to handle inputs more effectively. Additionally, understanding how `solve` from 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' processes and solves equations can provide crucial insights into supporting `Eq` objects and functional dependencies in `idiff`. No new files or code spans are necessary at this point, but a deeper integration or modification of existing functionalities might be the solution.",
