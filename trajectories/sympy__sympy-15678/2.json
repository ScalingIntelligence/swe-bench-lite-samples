The error messages indicate that 'idiff' is designed to work with 'Symbol' types and does not handle 'Function' types appropriately. In the provided code spans, the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' handles differentiation but raises errors when encountering 'Function' types like 'f(x)'. The function 'diff' in 'sympy/core/function.py' is also relevant as it provides the actual differentiation operation, indicating potential areas to expand functionality for 'Function' types. Additionally, the 'classify_ode' function in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' is somewhat related, as it deals with classifying and solving ODEs, which might need to consider 'Function' types for more generalized differential operations. The identified code spans show where the current logic fails for 'f(x)' types and where 'idiff' can potentially be modified to support new functionality.",
