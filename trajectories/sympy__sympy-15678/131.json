Based on the provided context, the `idiff` function is located in `sympy/geometry/util.py`. Additionally, expanding the search to include other relevant files like `sympy/solvers/ode.py` and `sympy/core/function.py` might yield further insights into how symbolic equations and function differentiation are handled.",

Upon initial inspection, the idiff function in sympy/geometry/util.py seems to be the main focus as it handles both of these cases. The function raises a ValueError when it encounters f(x), and it fails with an IndexError when trying to solve for derivatives using Eq. The remaining code spans in other files provide context for functions like diff and expand, which are likely necessary for implementing the corrections. However, the core issue with idiff appears to be addressed in the provided span, so further inspection of surrounding code is unnecessary for now, especially given the quick implementation suggested in the issue description.",

From the `file_context`, we see that `idiff` is defined to handle sequences and symbols but throws errors for function types and equations. The search results from `sympy/solvers/ode.py` do not directly address the issues in `idiff`. They deal with other ODE-related functions like `dsolve` and classification functions but do not fix the core issue with `idiff`. The `sympy/core/function.py` results provide context on how functions and derivatives are handled, which could be useful for understanding the environment `idiff` operates in. However, the immediate relevance is limited. Given the specific issues with `idiff`, the search results lack code spans that directly contribute to resolving these issues. A deeper integration into the `idiff` function might be necessary to address the `Eq` and function handling problems, which are not currently found in the search results.",
