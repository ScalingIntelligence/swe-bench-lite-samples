The first is that 'idiff' does not support equations defined with 'Eq' from the sympy library. The second is that 'idiff' does not support functions like 'f(x)' in place of 'y'. The provided search results directly address both of these issues as they contain the current implementation of the 'idiff' function. Specifically, the code checks if 'y' is a sequence or a symbol and raises a ValueError if it is not an x-dependent symbol. Additionally, the function attempts to solve differential equations by using the 'solve' function, which may be where the IndexError is arising for 'Eq'-defined equations. This code is directly relevant and seems to be the one that needs to be modified to handle 'Eq' and 'f(x)'-typed inputs.",
