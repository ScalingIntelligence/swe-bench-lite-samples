These issues point to potential problems in the way 'idiff' handles input types and equations. The search results provide context in the 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' file, particularly the 'solve' function and 'solve_linear' function, which might be relevant for handling 'Eq' objects and linear equations. The 'sympy/solvers/solveset.py' file contains a function 'linear_eq_to_matrix' that could be relevant for handling linear equations. Finally, the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file contains the actual implementation of the 'idiff' function, which is likely where the fixes are needed to handle the reported issues. By examining these sections of the code in relation to the reported issues, it should be possible to pinpoint the specific code spans that require modification or improvement to resolve the issues with 'idiff'.",
