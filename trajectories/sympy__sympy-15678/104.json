Reviewed the current file context: The context shows the implementation of 'idiff' in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. It includes the main functionality and checks for the type of 'y' and raises an error if it's not as expected.\n3. Processed new search results:\n  3.1. Examined 'diff' in 'sympy/core/function.py'. This function handles differentiation but is not directly related to the issues in 'idiff'.\n  3.2. Reviewed 'dsolve' and 'classify_ode' in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py'. These functions are relevant as they deal with solving and classifying ODEs, which might be used to implement or fix the issues in 'idiff'.\n  3.3. Identified that the main issue in 'idiff' is related to handling different types of 'y' (whether it's a symbol or a function) and handling 'Eq' objects correctly.\n  3.4. Discovered that 'idiff' raises an error for 'f(x)', indicating it expects 'x-dependent symbol(s)'.\n  3.5. Noted that the current implementation of 'idiff' might not correctly handle 'Eq' objects, leading to an IndexError.\n  3.6. Concluded that the relevant code spans are in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' for 'idiff' and in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' for potential fixes or enhancements.\n4. Determined that the search task is not yet complete as further analysis and possible implementation are needed to address the issues with 'idiff' handling 'Eq' and 'f(x)'.",

This suggests that 'idiff' needs modifications to handle these cases.\n\nI then reviewed the current file context provided, specifically focusing on the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. The function currently handles cases where 'y' is an 'x-dependent symbol', but it doesn't handle 'Eq' and 'f(x)' properly.\n\nNext, I processed the new search results. In 'sympy/core/function.py', there are multiple spans related to functions and derivatives, which could be relevant for implementing support for 'Eq' and 'f(x)' in 'idiff'.\n\nIn 'sympy/solvers/ode.py', there are spans related to handling ODEs, classification of ODEs, and specific solutions for ODEs. These are also relevant to the issue, as 'idiff' relates to solving ODEs.\n\nBased on the relevance of these code spans to the issue, I've identified the following code spans that are relevant for handling 'Eq' and 'f(x)' in 'idiff'.",

It raises 'ValueError' for certain cases. Additionally, the `sympy/solvers/ode.py` contains logic for solving ordinary differential equations, but it does not directly handle the specific issues reported with `idiff`.
