The provided code span contains the definition of the 'idiff' function. It is evident that the function is not equipped to handle 'Eq' objects directly as it assumes 'y' to be a sequence or a symbol. There's also a likely issue at the line 'yp = solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0].subs(derivs)' where an 'IndexError' may occur if 'solve' returns an empty list. Additionally, the function raises a 'ValueError' when 'y' is not an 'x-dependent symbol', which suggests a stricter validation than required for a function like 'f(x)'. This span is highly relevant as it directly addresses the core functionality that needs to be corrected for supporting 'Eq' and 'f(x)'.",

However, the second part of the issue regarding `idiff` not supporting `Eq` is not directly addressed in the provided code. The `IndexError` from the issue could be due to a list index out of range when trying to solve for the differential, which suggests that the `solve` function might not be returning an expected result.
