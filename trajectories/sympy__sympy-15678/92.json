Upon analysis, the most relevant file seems to be 'sympy/geometry/util.py' which contains the definition of 'idiff'. The issue is directly related to the 'idiff' function's handling of Eq (equality) and the function application f(x). The code in span 'idiff' from file 'sympy/geometry/util.py' is where the current implementation exists and where corrections are needed for supporting Eq and f(x).\n\nIn the 'idiff' span, the function first checks if 'y' is a sequence or a symbol and raises an error if it's not. This handling needs to be extended to support 'Eq' objects and function applications like 'f(x)'. The comments in the issue suggest expanding the function to correctly handle these cases, especially around the line where it tries to solve for the derivative and the error handling part.\n\nThe other files and spans, such as parsing functions and other utility functions, while relevant to SymPy's broader functioning, are not directly related to fixing the 'idiff' function reported in the issue.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue with 'idiff' involves two main problems: 1) 'idiff' does not support the use of 'Eq' in its arguments, leading to an IndexError when trying to solve for the derivative. 2) 'idiff' also does not support differentiation with respect to functions of the independent variable, instead expecting symbols. This led to a ValueError when attempting to use 'f(x)'.\n\nThe initial context provided the main function implementation of 'idiff' in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. This code spans involve the core logic of 'idiff' which raises the ValueError when encountering 'f(x)' instead of a symbol, and tries to solve the differential equation.\n\nThe new search results provide various files and code spans related to different parts of SymPy. Key files include those handling parsing, derivatives, integrals, ODE classification, and system of ODEs.
