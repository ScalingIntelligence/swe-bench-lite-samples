The provided search results contain two relevant code spans: one in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' that defines the 'idiff' function, and another in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' that contains imports and functions related to solving ODEs, which might be relevant given the nature of the issue described. The 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' handles the differential equation and checks for the type of dependent symbols, which is directly relevant to the reported issue, especially the error handling for unsupported types. The imported functions and classes in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py', such as 'solve', 'Eq', and 'diff', are also likely related, as they are fundamental to addressing the issues with the 'idiff' function.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, we can infer that the 'idiff' function needs to be updated to handle 'Eq' objects and expressions with functions like 'f(x)' properly, addressing the IndexError and ValueError described in the issue. The presence of 'diff', 'solve', and 'Eq' in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' also suggests that this module could support the necessary functionality for making the corrections to 'idiff'. Therefore, both the code span defining 'idiff' and the module that includes related functions should be considered relevant to address the issue.",
