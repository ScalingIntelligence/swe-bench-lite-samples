This report includes explicit examples of code failing due to these limitations. To address these issues, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the 'idiff' function definition. The code span with id 'idiff' in the file 'sympy/geometry/util.py' contains the entire definition of the 'idiff' function. This spans includes the logic for handling different types of inputs and performing implicit differentiation. Given that the errors described in the issue pertain directly to the 'idiff' function's handling of input types and differentiation logic, I conclude that the code span with id 'idiff' is relevant to resolving the issues in the report.

The traceback indicates that the error occurs within the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. The issue with Eq is likely due to the 'idiff' function not being designed to handle Eq objects directly, and the issue with f(x) instead of y suggests that the function does not handle more complex expressions involving functions. The 'sympy/core/relational.py' file contains definitions for Eq and related classes such as Equality, which should be relevant for handling Eq objects. This file does not directly address the 'idiff' function but provides the necessary relational operators and classes that 'idiff' might need to integrate for handling Eq objects. The remaining search results are not directly relevant to the issue at hand as they deal with different types of functions and imports which are not immediately related to the 'idiff' function's capability to handle Eq and f(x) structures.",
