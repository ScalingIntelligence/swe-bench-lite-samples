In the search results, the `idiff` function is found in `sympy/geometry/util.py`. This function is responsible for implicit differentiation and includes checks for different types of inputs, including sequences and symbols. The error handling for unsupported types like `f(x)` is also present. The function attempts to solve for derivatives and substitutes back the original functions. This code span is highly relevant to the reported issue as it directly addresses the problems mentioned. Additionally, examining the entire section of code related to `idiff` provides a comprehensive understanding of its functionality and potential points of failure.
