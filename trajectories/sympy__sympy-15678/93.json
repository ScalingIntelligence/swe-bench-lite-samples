The error when using `idiff` with `Eq` is an `IndexError`, indicating a problem with indexing at `diff` and `solve` operations. The error when using a function of x (`f(x)`) results in a `ValueError`, indicating an issue with the type of symbol expected. Given the context, it's clear that the `idiff` function in `sympy/geometry/util.py` is where the primary issue lies. Additionally, due to the nature of the errors, it might be beneficial to look into the `solve` and `diff` functions within the SymPy codebase to ensure compatibility and handle these cases correctly.",

This function is clearly relevant to the reported issue because it handles the implicit differentiation that is failing. There is also another significant file, 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py', which contains a 'solve' function that may be related to how 'idiff' tries to solve for the derivative symbolically, also indicating potential places for corrections or enhancements to support Eq and custom functions better. The third file, 'sympy/core/function.py', includes the 'diff' function which is crucial for any type of differentiation, but it doesn't directly address the limitations specified in the issue, although understanding how it works could be useful.

The provided file_context already includes the relevant code span (idiff) that needs to be addressed. The search results include additional functions such as 'solve' from sympy/solvers/solvers.py, 'diff' from sympy/core/function.py, and 'diff' methods from sympy/logic/boolalg.py and sympy/holonomic/holonomic.py which provide different implementations of differentiation. These are likely relevant for enhancing the idiff function's capabilities, particularly the 'solve' function which is used in the idiff implementation. However, the focus should primarily remain on the idiff function itself, as the issue is specifically about its limitations. The search results provide a broader context of SymPy's functionality, which could be useful for future enhancements of the idiff function, but they do not directly offer new code spans that would immediately resolve the current issues with idiff handling Eq and Function expressions. The immediate task, therefore, remains to adjust the idiff function in sympy/geometry/util.py to correctly process Eq and Function instances.",

Additionally, the function tries to solve for the derivative `dydx` by indexing into the result of `solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)`, which can raise an `IndexError` if the list returned by `solve` is empty. This suggests that both the current handling of types and the behavior of `solve` in conjunction with `diff` are critical points of failure. To enhance `idiff`, we must: 1) Ensure `solve` can properly handle equations of type `Eq` and return a valid result. 2) Verify that `diff` correctly differentiates functions of `x`.

The second issue is that `idiff` does not support expressions with `Function` objects, causing a ValueError due to expecting x-dependent symbols. To address these issues, an inspection of the `solve` function in `sympy.solvers.solvers` is necessary, as it is the function called within `idiff` that likely causes the error when handling `Eq`. Furthermore, to support expressions with `Function` objects, modifications in how symbols are identified and processed in `idiff` might be required, potentially by leveraging the `diff` methods available in other related modules, such as `sympy.core.function` and `sympy.logic.boolalg`, to handle symbolic differentiation differently.",
