            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights two problems with the 'idiff' function in SymPy's geometry module:\n\n1. 'idiff' doesn't support handling equations of the form 'Eq(y*exp(y), x*exp(x))'.\n2. 'idiff' also doesn't support handling symbol functions like 'f(x)' instead of 'y'.\n\nThe first problem involves differentiating equations involving both 'y' and 'x', which currently results in an 'IndexError: list index out of range' due to the inability to solve the resulting differential equation. The second problem arises because 'idiff' is designed to handle symbols, yet 'f(x)' is recognized as a Function type without being differentiated properly.\n\nGiven the nature of the issues, the most relevant part of the provided search results is the 'idiff' function definition itself in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file. This function is where the logic for implicit differentiation is handled, and both of the issues described seem to stem from areas within this function's implementation. Therefore, the focus should be on revising or enhancing the logic within this function to better handle the scenarios presented by the reported issues. For instance, the function should potentially validate the type of input (checking if the input is an 'Equality' equation rather than assuming it will differentiate correctly), and it might need to extend support for differentiating functions that are encapsulated in other operations\u2014these are likely paths to address the deficiencies mentioned.\n\nSince the issue's resolution strongly relies on modifying or adding capabilities to the 'idiff' function, all the spans within the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file are pertinent, particularly the section where 'idiff' is defined and implemented, as this directly involves the functionality that needs to be adjusted.",

The task involves identifying additional relevant code spans from the <search_results> section that could be pertinent to enhancing `idiff` to address these issues. The analysis looks for functions or parts of the codebase that might help in differentiating or substituting expressions involving `Eq` and functions like `f(x)`. \n\nUpon reviewing the <search_results>, the `diff` function from `sympy/core/function.py` is directly relevant as it is responsible for differentiating functions. Similarly, the `dsolve` function in `sympy/solvers/ode.py` is relevant because it deals with solving differential equations, which is closely related to what `idiff` is intended to do. The `classify_ode` function could also be useful for understanding how ODEs are classified and handled before solving.
