The provided code snippet in the search results contains the definition of the 'idiff' function. This function is likely where the modifications need to be made to address the reported issues. Specifically, the function should be able to handle 'Eq' objects and recognize 'f(x)' as a valid dependent variable. The existing code already raises an error when it encounters 'f(x)' due to the type check. To resolve the issues, the function needs to be enhanced to accommodate these cases. Given the context, this span of code is highly relevant to addressing the reported issues.",

Both issues are related to the handling of input types and the differentiation process. From the provided context and search results, it is evident that the primary code spans relevant to these issues are located in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' under the function 'idiff'. This function currently checks for 'Symbol' instances but doesn't handle 'Eq' or functions like 'f(x)' appropriately. The search results show additional contexts like 'sympy/core/function.py' with 'diff' function, 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' with 'dsolve' and 'classify_ode', and 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' with 'solve', but these seem more related to generic differentiation, ODE solving, and equation solving functionalities rather than the specific issues with 'idiff'. Therefore, the focus should remain on refining 'idiff' in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. The identified code spans in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' are crucial for direct fixes or additions to support 'Eq' and 'f(x)' properly, considering the reported Traceback errors which indicate specific lines of failure.",
