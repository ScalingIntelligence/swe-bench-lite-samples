It's crucial to note that 'idiff' does handle some symbolic expressions but fails in the given scenarios.

However, the function currently does not support 'Eq' instances directly, which may lead to the IndexError reported in the issue. Additionally, encountering 'f(x)' instead of 'y' results in a ValueError stating 'expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: f(x)'. To rectify these issues, the function should be updated to properly handle both cases. Specifically, SymPy's 'solve' and 'diff' functions may need modifications or additional handling for 'Eq' instances and 'f(x)' symbols. We need to explore how SymPy typically handles 'Eq' instances for solving or differentiation, and distinguish 'f(x)' from typical 'y' symbols in differentiation. Investigating the core SymPy modules and other functions like 'dsolve' in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' could provide further insights into how to handle these special cases for better error resolution.",

Additionally, encountering 'f(x)' instead of 'y' results in a ValueError stating 'expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: f(x)'. To rectify these issues, the function should be updated to properly handle both cases. Specifically, SymPy's 'solve' and 'diff' functions may need modifications or additional handling for 'Eq' instances and 'f(x)' symbols. We need to explore how SymPy typically handles 'Eq' instances for solving or differentiation, and distinguish 'f(x)' from typical 'y' symbols in differentiation.
