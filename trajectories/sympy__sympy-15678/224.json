The current search results have identified the 'idiff' function definition in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' and other import statements and functions in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py'. The 'idiff' function code explicitly handles Symbol types and raises an error for non-Symbol types, which explains the behavior with f(x). It also attempts to solve derivatives using 'solve', which likely fails with Eq and leads to the IndexError. These findings suggest that the 'idiff' function logic needs adjustments to correctly handle Eq objects and to support function types like f(x).",

The function's current behavior indicates it doesn't support Eq objects and cannot handle expressions involving functions like f(x). The tracebacks from the issue description align with the exceptions raised in the idiff function. Additionally, the presence of related modules such as sympy/solvers/ode.py suggests further examination in the context of differential equations, which might also entail checking sympy/core/function.py for comprehensive functional expression handling. Given the provided file context and the direct relevance to the issue at hand, it appears that the critical parts of the codebase related to addressing this issue have been identified, even though additional context from other parts of the codebase might be beneficial for a complete understanding and fix. It's possible that modules handling more complex aspects of differential equations and expressions might not be fully captured in the current context, but these are secondary in comparison to the directly implicated idiff function.",

The sympy/core/function.py and sympy/solvers/ode.py contexts provide essential background on how functions and ODEs are managed in SymPy, which is crucial for understanding how to enhance idiff. However, while the code snippets touch on relevant aspects like the Function class and symbolic equation handling, they do not demonstrate definitive fixes or enhancements specific to the support of Eq and f(x) in idiff.
