Upon reviewing the provided code, it's clear that the function 'idiff' in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' is the main function where these issues would be addressed. The function already contains logic to handle sequences and symbols, but it lacks specific handling for instances where the equation might be an instance of Eq or where the dependent variable is a function of x rather than a symbol. This suggests that modifications to support these cases would need to be made within this function. Specifically, the function should be updated to check if the input 'eq' is an instance of Eq and handle it appropriately, and also to accept dependent variables that are functions of x. The current implementation raises a ValueError for such cases, indicating that these are indeed areas that need improvement. Therefore, the identified code span is highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
