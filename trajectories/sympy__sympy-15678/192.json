The search results focus on various implementations of the `diff` method across different modules in the sympy codebase. However, the direct code related to `idiff` is not evident in the provided search results. The closest match to the issue's context would be the `solve` method in `sympy/matrices/matrices.py` and `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`, as these methods are likely to be used in solving differential equations where `idiff` might be implemented. Additionally, the `diff` method implementations in `sympy/core/expr.py`, `sympy/core/function.py`, and other similar files deal with derivatives, which are fundamental to the operation of `idiff`. Although these results are not directly related to `idiff`, they provide essential background on how differentiation is handled in different contexts within the codebase, which could be crucial for resolving the reported issue. Given the limitations of the search results, it's recommended to review these files and potentially expand the search scope to more directly address the `idiff` functionality.",
