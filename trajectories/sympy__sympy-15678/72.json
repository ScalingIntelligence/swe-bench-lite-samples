The analysis involves reviewing the 'idiff' implementation to identify where support for 'Eq' and functions like 'f(x)' should be added. Additionally, examining the current context shows that 'idiff' uses 'solve' to handle its calculations, and understanding how 'solve' and 'subs' are used in the implementation is crucial for making targeted modifications.
