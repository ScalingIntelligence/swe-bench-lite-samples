It doesn't support functions like `f(x)` for the dependent variable. Analyzing the provided context and search results, we can identify relevant code spans to address these issues.\n\nFirstly, for the support of `Eq` class, the search results from `sympy/core/relational.py` indicate that `Eq` is defined as `Equality`, making it necessary to handle `Equality` objects in the `idiff` function. This is evidenced by the code span with id 'impl:5', where `Eq = Equality` is defined.\n\nSecondly, the issue regarding the support for `f(x)` as a dependent variable can be addressed by examining the handling of symbols or functions in `idiff`. The main span in `sympy/geometry/util.py` already includes code that raises a `ValueError` for symbols like `f(x)` that are not properly bound to `x`. This indicates a need to enhance the function to correctly process expressions depending on `x` that are not straightforward symbols but rather functions.\n\nConsidering these points and further examination of the code sections provided, particularly in the `sympy/solvers/ode.py` around the `dsolve` function (with the id 'dsolve'), additional insights into how SymPy handles equations involving function expressions like `f(x)` are gained. This knowledge can guide further modifications to `idiff` to properly handle such cases.\n\nTo sum up, the identified code spans in 'sympy/core/relational.py' (specifically for 'impl:5') and the detailed context in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' for 'idiff' provide a solid base to start modifying the `idiff` function to support `Eq` and expressions like `f(x)`.",

The current context provided already includes code spans from 'sympy/geometry/util.py' which defines the 'idiff' function. We should look for additional code spans in the new search results that might help in correcting these issues.\n\n1. 'idiff' not supporting 'Eq': We need to find code related to handling 'Eq' (equality) objects. The current context already includes spans from 'sympy/core/relational.py' which defines the 'Equality' class and its methods, including '__new__' and '_eval_relation'. This is relevant as it provides the functionality for 'Eq' objects. We should ensure we have all necessary parts of this implementation to handle 'Eq' within 'idiff'.\n\n2. 'idiff' not supporting 'f(x)' instead of 'y': This involves handling function expressions. The new search results include spans from 'sympy/core/function.py', particularly the 'Function' class and its methods such as '_eval_derivative'. This is relevant as it pertains to differentiating function expressions, which is crucial for supporting 'f(x)' in 'idiff'.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the context provided, the relevant code spans are found in the already identified files and new search results, focusing on the 'idiff' function definition and the related functionality for handling 'Eq' and 'Function' objects.",
