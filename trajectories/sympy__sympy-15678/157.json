The error traces suggest problems in how `idiff` handles these cases. Given the context provided, it's clear that `idiff` is defined in `sympy/geometry/util.py`, and the errors occur when `solve` does not return any solutions, leading to an `IndexError`. Additionally, there's a `ValueError` when `idiff` is used with `f(x)`. To address these issues, we should focus on the code within `idiff` and its dependencies. We need to check how `idiff` processes the input types and how it attempts to solve for derivatives. Also, we should look at any utility functions that `idiff` might be calling for solving or substituting expressions.",

The provided search results contain the 'idiff' function in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file. This function is responsible for implicit differentiation of equations. The function currently raises errors for the scenarios described in the issue, particularly lines that deal with checking the type of 'y'. These lines are crucial as they determine whether 'y' is an 'x'-dependent symbol or not. The code span containing the 'idiff' function is directly relevant to addressing the reported issue because it outlines the current implementation and the specific points where the code fails to handle 'Eq' and 'f(x)'. Analyzing and modifying this code span will be essential for implementing the required fixes. The 'solve' function from 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' is also relevant as it is used within the 'idiff' function to solve equations, which will be crucial for correcting the 'IndexError' when 'solve' returns an empty list. Thus, the provided search results have revealed the necessary code spans that are directly applicable to resolving the issues described in the report.",
