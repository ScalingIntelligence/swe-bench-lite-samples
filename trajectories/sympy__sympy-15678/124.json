The initial focus should be on the file `sympy/geometry/util.py` where the idiff function is defined. Additionally, given the nature of the issue, looking into related modules like `sympy/solvers/ode.py` and `sympy/core/function.py` could be beneficial to understand how solve and diff functions are handled in similar contexts. The examples provided suggest that the idiff function might not be accommodating Symbolic equations properly, which involves understanding how symbolic manipulations are done in the `sympy/core` module. Since the error occurs with both Eq() and f(x) forms, it might be necessary to ensure that the function can handle both forms, which might involve checking how symbols and functions are differentiated and solved within the SymPy framework.",

It does not support functions of the form 'f(x)' in place of 'y'. The provided search results include relevant code in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' where the 'idiff' function is defined. The function definition shows handling for symbols and functions but lacks direct support for 'Eq' types and specific handling for 'f(x)' where it expects x-dependent symbols. Apart from 'idiff', other spans in 'sympy/core/function.py' and 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' are for auxiliary functions that might be used in resolving the issue but are not directly relevant to fixing 'idiff' itself. It is concluded that fixing 'idiff' will require modifications within its current implementation to accommodate 'Eq' and 'f(x)', and these specific parts are identified in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file.",

Analyzing the provided code context and search results, the relevant sections of interest are where `idiff` is defined, how it processes equations, symbols, and their derivatives. \n\nThe initial `idiff` function in `sympy/geometry/util.py` already captures the structure of error handling and integration of derivatives. We need to expand this function to include support for differentiation of an equality object, specifically to handle `Eq` from the SymPy core, which represents an equation. Additionally, we're required to adapt the function to permit expressions integrating `f(x)`, indicating the need for further checks during the symbol substitution phase. \n\nIn the search results, the `sympy/core/function.py` contains the `diff` function which is widely used throughout SymPy for differentiation. This could serve as a reference for potentially enhancing the differentiation handling in `idiff` alongside modifications to `isinstance` checks in `idiff` to now recognize expressions involving any function of `x`, including `f(x)`. \n\nFinally, extraction of certain individuals spans across these sections demands clear detailing of what exactly is required for the specific inputs and expected outcomes. Review and integration of several areas notably focused within `idiff`, `diff`, and extensive referencing across classes and utilities for patterns governing function assumptions and symbolic manipulations are crucial.",

The function explicitly expects `y` to be either a sequence of symbols or a single symbol, which precludes handling more complex expressions or functions directly. This is likely the root cause of the errors encountered when using `Eq` and `f(x)` forms.

Based on the provided context and search results, the key areas to look at are the definition and implementation of 'idiff' in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', the handling of 'Eq' and 'Derivative' objects in 'sympy/core/function.py', and the overall context in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py'. The issue suggests that 'idiff' should be modified to handle 'Eq' objects properly and to accept 'f(x)' as a valid symbol for differentiation. The search results contain sections of 'Derivative' class and its methods in 'sympy/core/function.py', which are crucial for understanding how differentiation is handled in SymPy. Additionally, 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' has imports and functions related to ODE solving, which might be indirectly relevant. The relevant code spans are those that deal directly with the handling of 'Eq' and 'f(x)' in the 'idiff' function and related differentiation logic.",

This function is shown to raise errors when dealing with equations involving `Eq` and functions like `f(x)`, as it expects `y` to be a symbol or a sequence of symbols. This aligns with the issues described. Furthermore, the context provides additional affiliated modules: `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/solvers/ode.py`, which could contain more relevant code for expanding `idiff`\u2019s capabilities to handle `Eq` and `f(x)`. However, directly examining `idiff` suggests that implementing necessary changes to support these cases would typically require modifications in its code logic, possibly involving collaboration with utilities from the mentioned modules. Given these points, we can infer that while the `idiff` function needs adjustments for full compatibility, this perspective is corroborated by the wider context, indicating that the file context likely contains most, if not all, pertinent information required to address the issue.",
