The stack traces and examples indicate that the issues primarily involve the `idiff` function itself and potentially associated methods within the SymPy library, particularly in modules related to geometry, solvers, and core functions.

It doesn't support using `f(x)` directly instead of `y`. The provided search results include the implementation of `idiff` in the file 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. The function checks for `x-dependent symbols` and throws an error if it doesn't find them as expected for the case involving `f(x)`. Additionally, the traceback indicates that the function fails when trying to solve the differential equation due to an `IndexError`. This suggests that the issue might stem from how the function handles specific input types or the solving process itself. Consequently, the entire span of the `idiff` function should be marked as relevant for addressing these issues, as changes will likely be required across the function to handle both `Eq` and `f(x)` cases appropriately, and to prevent exceptions like `IndexError` during the solving process.",
