To address these, we need to look into the implementation of 'idiff' and related functions that handle differential equations and symbolic computations. Specifically, we should focus on the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file where 'idiff' is initially defined, and also consider related files in the 'sympy/solvers' and 'sympy/core' directories that handle differential equations and symbolic functions. Additionally, we should explore the 'sympy/functions' and 'sympy/integrals' directories as they may contain supporting functions for solving and manipulating expressions.",
