It does not support expressions with functions like 'f(x)' instead of 'y'. Upon analyzing the provided search results, the current implementation of 'idiff' in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file is identified as highly relevant. Specifically, the function raises a 'ValueError' if it encounters an 'x-dependent symbol' that is not supported, which aligns with the issues described. Moreover, the function attempts to solve for derivatives and substitute them back into the equation, which could potentially address the support for 'Eq' and functions like 'f(x)'. The additional files and spans, such as the 'diff' function in 'sympy/core/function.py' and the 'dsolve' and 'classify_ode' functions in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py', though not directly related to the 'idiff' function, are part of the broader differential equation solving capabilities in SymPy and might be indirectly relevant for context or to understand the broader system. However, their direct relevance is less pronounced compared to the 'idiff' function itself. Given the issues reported, the focus should primarily remain on correcting the 'idiff' function to handle 'Eq' and 'f(x)' appropriately, and further inspection of other parts of the codebase might not be necessary unless new problems arise specifically related to ODE solving that connect back to these broader functions.",

This confirms that some parts of the relevant code to address the issue are indeed present, specifically the handling of algebraic differentiation directly within the `idiff` function. However, the direct handling of `Eq` objects within `idiff` is not shown, which suggests that the file context might not be complete for issues related to `Eq`.

From the current file context, it's evident that `idiff` is defined in `sympy/geometry/util.py`. Now, considering the new search results: \n\n1. In `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` file, the `solve` function is found. This function is relevant as `idiff` uses `solve` internally and modifications might be needed to support `Eq` objects. \n\n2. In `sympy/core/function.py`, the `diff` function is found. Although the reported issue doesn't directly mention problems with `diff`, it is still relevant as differentiating equations is central to both `idiff` and `solve` functions. \n\nBased on this analysis, I identified spans in each file that are likely relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
