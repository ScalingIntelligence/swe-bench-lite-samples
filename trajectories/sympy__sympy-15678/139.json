The tracebacks provided in the issue indicate that the errors occur in the `idiff` function due to unsupported cases. The current context indicates no relevant code has been identified yet.

The current implementation in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' checks if 'y' is a sequence or a symbol and raises an error if it is not, which explains the error when 'f(x)' is provided as the dependent variable. Additionally, the current implementation assumes that the equation can be directly differentiated, which breaks when the equation is not directly separable. The 'solve' function within 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py' is relevant because it is used within 'idiff' to solve for the derivative, and understanding how 'solve' handles different types of equations could inform how to modify 'idiff' to handle 'Eq' objects and function dependencies seamlessly.",
