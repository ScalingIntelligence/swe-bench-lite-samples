The existing implementation of 'idiff' raises errors in these cases. \n\nThe search results present the code for 'idiff' in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', which includes the logic handling the differentiation. The function first checks if 'y' is a sequence or a symbol, and if not, it raises a 'ValueError' indicating that it expects an x-dependent symbol. This error corresponds to the issue where 'idiff' fails when given a function like 'f(x)' instead of a simple symbol. Additionally, in the same function, an 'IndexError' is mentioned in the comments, which likely corresponds to the failure when 'Eq' is used, particularly when the list index is out of range in the 'solve' function.\n\nGiven these observations, the identified span in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' is indeed relevant to the reported issue, as it directly addresses the current limitations and anticipated improvements mentioned in the issue description. This span contains the current implementation of 'idiff', which is the central function under discussion for enhancement.",
