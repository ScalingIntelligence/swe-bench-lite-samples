The error traces indicate problematic sections within the `idiff` function itself in the `sympy/geometry/util.py` file. Additionally, the `solve` function might be relevant for debugging the list index error when no solution is found. The `diff` function in `sympy/core/function.py` could also be related to the issue as it might be called within `idiff`. Understanding how the `solve` function and `idiff` interact is crucial for correcting the behavior with `Eq` and `f(x)`.",

The tracebacks from the issue indicate that the function fails at specific points in its execution: one instance fails because 'solve' returns an empty list, leading to an 'IndexError', and the other fails because it doesn't accept 'f(x)' as an input, resulting in a 'ValueError'. The code spans provided in the search results include the 'idiff' function itself, which is directly related to the operations described in the issue. Additionally, the 'Derivative' class in 'sympy.core.function' could be relevant for understanding how differentiation is handled in the module.
