The error messages indicate that there are problems when handling equations of the form Eq(y*exp(y), x*exp(x)) and when the dependent variable is given as a function (e.g., f(x)). The relevant code spans have been identified in several files within the SymPy package, particularly in files related to geometric utilities, core functions, and ODE solvers. To address the issue, we need to focus on the idiff function's implementation and its interactions with these different components to enhance its handling of the specified inputs.",
