The function 'idiff' likely handles the differentiation of implicit functions, but it encounters errors when the input equation is an instance of 'Eq' or when the dependent variable is a function like 'f(x)' rather than a symbol. To address these issues, we need to locate the specific areas in the 'idiff' function where support for these cases can be added or modified. Additionally, checking other potentially related functions such as 'diff', 'dsolve', and other ODE and PDE solvers in the SymPy library might provide insight into how to correctly handle these cases.",

It raises 'ValueError' when 'f(x)' is encountered and has potential issues with handling the case of 'solve' returning an empty list (as indicated by the 'IndexError').

Additionally, the `simplify` module in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` contains functions like `inversecombine` that could be relevant if the simplification of expressions involving `Eq` or `f(x)` is needed. The `fu` module in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` also contains trigonometric simplification functions that could be leveraged if trigonometric identities are involved in the expression differentiation.
