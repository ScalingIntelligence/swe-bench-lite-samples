The second issue is that 'idiff' does not support differentiation with respect to a function instead of a symbol (e.g., f(x) instead of y). Both issues are related to the 'idiff' function and its handling of input types. To address these issues, the search should focus on the 'idiff' function in relevant files and any associated functions or classes that might be involved in handling equations or functions as arguments.",

The provided search results contain the 'idiff' function definition. The function is found in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file. The issue with 'Eq' support seems related to the line 'yp = solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0].subs(derivs)' where an IndexError is encountered for 'list index out of range'. This suggests that 'solve' might not be returning any solutions, which could be due to the form of 'eq'. The issue with 'f(x)' instead of 'y' is caused by the error handling for x-dependent symbols 'raise ValueError(\"expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: %s\" % y)'. The function does not properly handle or substitute expressions like 'f(x)'. This indicates that the 'idiff' function's current implementation is not robust enough to handle these types of inputs.

Additionally, the function uses 'solve' which might fail if the input equation is of type 'Eq'.
