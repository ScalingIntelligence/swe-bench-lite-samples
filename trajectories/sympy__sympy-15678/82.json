The tracebacks provided indicate that the 'idiff' function is located in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. The issues reported involve handling 'Eq' objects and functions like 'f(x)' instead of 'y'. To address these issues, we need to focus on improving the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. Additionally, considering that 'idiff' involves differential operations, it would also be beneficial to check the 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' file for any potential connections or utility functions related to differential equations that might help in addressing the issues.",

From the provided context and search results, we see that `idiff` is defined in `sympy/geometry/util.py` and raises errors when dealing with `Eq` and `f(x)`. The search results in `sympy/solvers/ode.py` contain relevant imports and functions related to solving ODEs, including handling of functions and equations. However, none of the explicitly defined functions in `sympy/solvers/ode.py` directly handle the issues reported for `idiff`. Given the context, the core logic for `idiff` does not seem to be in `sympy/solvers/ode.py`. Therefore, we conclude that while `sympy/solvers/ode.py` provides relevant background for understanding ODE solving, there is no immediate section in the search results that directly offers a solution to the specific issues reported for `idiff`.",
