From the provided search results, we can see the implementation of the 'idiff' function in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file. This function is responsible for implicit differentiation and seems to be the exact place where these issues arise. The code checks if 'y' is a sequence or a symbol and raises a 'ValueError' if it is not an x-dependent symbol. This behavior directly relates to the reported issue where 'f(x)' is not accepted. Additionally, the function attempts to solve the differential equation using the 'solve' method, which might fail with 'Eq' objects due to their symbolic nature. Therefore, the code span identified as 'idiff' is directly relevant to the reported issue and should be addressed to support 'Eq' objects and 'f(x)' symbols.",

We start by examining the current file context provided, especially focusing on `idiff` in `sympy/geometry/util.py` and the `Equality` class in `sympy/core/relational.py`. We then proceed to analyze new search results to find additional relevant code spans that could help in implementing support for `Eq` and `f(x)`.\n\n1. **Examination of `idiff` in `sympy/geometry/util.py`:**\n   - The `idiff` function is defined to handle implicit differentiation. It checks if `y` is a sequence or a symbol and raises an error if `y` is not an x-dependent symbol. This code is foundational to understanding the context of the issue.\n2. **Examination of `Equality` in `sympy/core/relational.py`:**\n   - The `Equality` class represents the `Eq` function and handles relations between expressions.\n   - We focus on methods and properties within `Equality` that might be relevant to integrating `Eq` into `idiff`.\n\n3. **New Search Results Analysis:**\n   - We find relevant code spans in `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/core/relational.py` that could be useful for expanding the functionality of `idiff`. The `Function` class and its derivatives are examined for their role in symbolic functions, which might be relevant for supporting `f(x)` in `idiff`.\n   - Within `relational.py`, we review the `Relational` class and its properties, which underpin the functionality of `Equality` and other relational operators.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans will be crucial for the development of solutions to the reported issues, particularly in `sympy/geometry/util.py` for `idiff`, and the handling of symbolic relations in `sympy/core/relational.py` and `sympy/core/function.py`. Therefore, the task involves carefully integrating these code spans into potential solutions that address the specific problems raised in the reported issue.",

The 'idiff' function is currently designed to handle symbolic differentiation but is encountering errors with certain inputs as reported. The 'sympy/core/relational.py' file contains the 'Equality' class, which is crucial for understanding how 'Eq' objects are managed and evaluated. This includes methods like '__new__' and '_eval_relation' that are pivotal in determining equality between expressions. Additionally, the 'sympy/core/function.py' file provides insights into symbolic differentiation handling, which could be pertinent to improving 'idiff'. The current task focuses on understanding how these pieces interact to potentially enhance 'idiff'. The reported issues indicate a gap in functionality related to 'Eq' objects and 'f(x)' differentiation within 'idiff'. The provided file context seems comprehensive in addressing these issues, with detailed methods and class definitions for 'Eq' and symbolic differentiation. However, further exploration into how 'sympy/geometry/util.py' exactly interacts and integrates with these functionalities in 'sympy/core/relational.py' and 'sympy/core/function.py' is required to ensure all relevant code for the issues is identified.",
            "search_suggestions": "Further examination of the interaction between 'sympy/geometry/util.py', 'sympy/core/relational.py', and 'sympy/core/function.py' to identify how exactly 'idiff' employs the functionalities from these files for handling 'Eq' objects and functions like 'f(x)'. Specifically, checking for methods or integrations in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' that are not currently covered in the provided context might reveal additional relevant code."
