The current context already provides the relevant 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. The new search results bring more context related to the 'diff' function in 'sympy/core/function.py', which might be needed as 'idiff' internally uses the 'diff' function. This suggests that changes might need to be made in both the handling of input types within 'idiff' to accommodate 'Eq' and 'f(x)' as well as adjustments on how 'diff' is invoked in the function logic. Thus, both 'sympy/geometry/util.py' and 'sympy/core/function.py' are likely to be relevant.",
