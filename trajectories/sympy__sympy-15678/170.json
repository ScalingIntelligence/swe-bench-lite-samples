The primary files of interest are those directly involved with differential calculus and symbolic manipulation. The `idiff` function is defined in `sympy/geometry/util.py` and related functions like `diff` and `expand` are in `sympy/core/function.py`. These files should be the starting point for investigating how `idiff` handles its inputs, particularly focusing on how it processes `Eq` objects and function expressions like `f(x)`. Additional files related to ODEs and differential functions, such as `sympy/solvers/ode.py` and `sympy/integrals/risch.py`, might also contain relevant code for handling these specific types of errors.",

The first problem is that 'idiff' does not support equations formatted with 'Eq'. The second problem is that 'idiff' does not support using 'f(x)' instead of 'y'. I then reviewed the provided search results to find code spans that deal with the 'idiff' function and its handling of equations and functions in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file. The span with id 'idiff' appears to define the 'idiff' function and includes error handling that aligns with the issues reported. This span should therefore be considered relevant to the reported issues. Furthermore, I checked other files like 'sympy/core/function.py' and 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' for additional context or related functions but found nothing directly related to the 'idiff' function's issues. The task seems complete with the identification of the relevant span in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. However, it's worth noting that the provided code does not directly address the corrections needed for the 'idiff' function as per the reported issues. These corrections involve supporting 'Eq' and using 'f(x)' instead of 'y', which require actual implementation changes rather than just identifying existing code.",
