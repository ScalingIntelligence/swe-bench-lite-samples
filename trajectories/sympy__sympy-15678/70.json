These issues are demonstrated by the provided code snippets, which show error traces when `idiff` is called with `Eq` and `f(x)`. The relevant code span from the search results is the implementation of `idiff` itself, specifically where it handles the input arguments and attempts to differentiate the equation. The tracebacks indicate that the function cannot correctly process these inputs, leading to index and value errors. Thus, the code span provided defines `idiff` and is directly related to the issues reported, warranting further investigation for corrections.",

Currently, the `idiff` function in `sympy/geometry/util.py` shows it handles differentiation implicitly with respect to `x` using `solve` on the differential equation. However, it explicitly checks for `Symbol` or sequence of `Symbol` and raises an error for any other type, which would include function symbols like `f(x)`. The function should be updated to handle these cases. The search results confirm the `idiff` function definition's existence in `sympy/geometry/util.py`. Additionally, `sympy/core/function.py` includes the `diff` function, which might be relevant for modifying `idiff` to handle `Eq` objects. There are also mentions of `dsolve` in `sympy/solvers/ode.py` and in the example script, which could provide insights into similar solutions for handling differential equations.",
