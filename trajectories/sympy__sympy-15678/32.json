The provided search results contain the implementation of the `idiff` function in the `sympy/geometry/util.py` file. The function currently processes `y` as a symbol dependent on `x`, but it does not handle `Eq` objects or functions explicitly. Thus, the code span targeted by the 'idiff' ID is highly relevant to the issue as it directly addresses the core functionality that needs to be enhanced. My analysis confirms that the current implementation indeed throws errors when `idiff` is used with `Eq` objects or `f(x)` instead of `y`, as the function is not designed to handle these cases. Therefore, this code span should be marked as relevant for further inspection and potential modification to address the reported issues.",
