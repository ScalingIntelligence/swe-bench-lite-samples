The primary file of interest is 'sympy/geometry/util.py' if the function is defined there, which seems likely given the usage examples and the tracebacks. Additional files that might be relevant include 'sympy/core/function.py', 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' for functions related to differential equations, and 'examples/intermediate/differential_equations.py' as it demonstrates usage of 'dsolve' functions which are likely related to 'idiff' in some way. The 'exp' class in 'sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py' is also relevant as it is used in the issue description. The goal will be to identify the exact points in these files where adjustments to support the use of 'Eq' and derivatives with respect to functions need to be made.",

The idiff function span in sympy.geometry.util.py is particularly important as it directly relates to the reported issue. It needs to be adjusted to support Eq objects and function types like f(x) properly. Additionally, the Function class in sympy.core.function.py contains methods relevant to function differentiation, which might be indirectly related to the issue. The sympy.solvers.ode.py file contains methods like dsolve, classify_sysode, and checkodesol, which are related to solving ordinary differential equations and thus also relevant to the reported issue.
