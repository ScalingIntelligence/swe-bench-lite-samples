The tracebacks indicate an IndexError due to unexpected conditions in the solve call within 'idiff', and a ValueError due to receiving a function instead of a symbol. Given the error locations and function names in the tracebacks, a focused search in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file for the 'idiff' function and related 'solve' function usage is necessary to address these issues. Additionally, considering 'idiff' might involve 'diff', 'solve', and other related functions, searching for these in the broader context of SymPy's function and solver modules is appropriate.",

The error messages indicate issues with solving the differential equation. The relevant code span identified is in `sympy/geometry/util.py` under the `idiff` function. This function is responsible for solving implicit differential equations. The analysis shows that the function needs to be adjusted to handle equations of type `Eq` and manage symbols like `f(x)` correctly. Other files found, such as those in `sympy/solvers/solvers.py`, `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`, and `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`, contain related functionalities such as `solve` and matrix operations, but they do not directly address the issues with `idiff`. Thus, the focus should remain on modifying the `idiff` function. The task appears to be incomplete as the `idiff` function needs modifications, which means more relevant code or context might be needed to fully address the issue.",

The current context and search results show the implementation of `idiff` in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. The function needs to handle `Eq` objects appropriately and support functions like `f(x)` instead of just symbols. The search results also include the 'solve' function in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py', which is used within `idiff` to solve for derivatives. This function could be modified to better handle the situations described in the issue. Additionally, 'sympy/matrices/matrices.py' and 'sympy/matrices/sparse.py' include matrix-related solving methods that might not be directly relevant to fixing `idiff` but could be useful for understanding solver behavior.",

This limitation is evident in the error messages provided in the issue, where 'idiff' fails when 'y' is 'f(x)' due to the type check. To address this, the function needs to be expanded to recognize and handle instances of 'Function' for 'y'. This could involve adding additional logic to differentiate between 'Function' and 'Symbol' instances and handle them accordingly within the function. Furthermore, the error handling within the 'idiff' function needs attention to ensure that it properly manages cases where 'solve' returns an empty list, which currently results in an 'IndexError' due to an attempt to access an element that does not exist. This suggests an improvement in robustness is necessary around the 'solve' function's usage within 'idiff'.",

The search results provide additional context in `sympy/geometry/util.py`, specifically the `idiff` function. To address the issues, we need to examine the `idiff` function's handling of `Eq` objects and functions like `f(x)`. The code in the `idiff` function checks if `y` is a sequence, a symbol, or raises an error for other types. This seems to be the part that doesn't handle `f(x)` correctly, as mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the `solve` function used inside `idiff` might not handle `Eq` objects appropriately, leading to the `IndexError` reported.
