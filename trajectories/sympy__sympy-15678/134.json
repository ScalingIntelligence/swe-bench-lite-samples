The issue mentions two specific problems: 1) 'idiff' does not support 'Eq', and 2) it does not support 'f(x)' instead of 'y'. The provided search results include the 'idiff' function which is the primary focus of the issue. Within the 'idiff' function, the relevant code spans are those handling the input parameters and the differentiation logic. The specific lines throwing errors in the issue's traceback are not present in the provided code spans, but the broader function definition is. The function 'idiff' checks if the dependent variable 'y' is a symbol or sequence, then performs the differentiation and solves the equation. This logic aligns with the issue's requirements to support 'Eq' and 'f(x)' directly. Therefore, the 'idiff' function is contextually relevant to the reported issue as it covers the expected functionality described in the issue. \n\nSteps taken to identify the relevant code: \n1. Understood the reported issue which is about 'idiff' not supporting 'Eq' and 'f(x)' directly. \n2. Located the 'idiff' function in the search results to analyze its code. \n3. Identified sections of the 'idiff' function related to parameter checking and differentiation logic which aligns with the issue's requirements. \n4. Determined that the logic within 'idiff' can be adjusted to incorporate 'Eq' and 'f(x)' based on the understanding of the issue's context and the provided code's capabilities. \n\nHence, the search task can be considered complete as the relevant code for addressing the issue has been identified.",
