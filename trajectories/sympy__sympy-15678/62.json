The relevant code spans are found in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' where the 'idiff' function is defined. This function is crucial as it directly addresses the issues raised. By examining the 'idiff' span, we can see where modifications might be needed to support 'Eq' and handle 'f(x)' or other functions. The function currently raises a 'ValueError' when encountering 'f(x)', indicating that it expects an x-dependent symbol rather than a function. Addressing this would involve enhancing the 'idiff' function to correctly identify and process 'f(x)' or similar function-based expressions. Additionally, the 'IndexError' in the 'solve' function within 'idiff' suggests an edge case where no solution is found, which might also need handling to prevent the error and potentially return a more meaningful result or error message. Furthermore, understanding how 'Eq' is intended to be processed in 'idiff' will be essential to ensure it can be handled correctly without errors. This analysis does not require looking into other files like 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' or 'sympy/core/function.py' as they do not directly pertain to the immediate issues of supporting 'Eq' and 'f(x)' in 'idiff'.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves two main problems with the 'idiff' function: it doesn't support 'Eq' objects and it doesn't support functions like 'f(x)' instead of 'y'. The current context and search results provide critical code spans that pertain to 'idiff' directly or deal with related operations such as differential solving and function handling. Specifically, the 'idiff' definition in the file context and search results (span id 'idiff') outlines the main logic of the function, including checks for 'x-dependent symbol(s)' and solving for derivatives. This direct match to the reported issue is essential for addressing the errors when 'Eq' objects or 'f(x)' functions are used. Additionally, the 'solve' function (span id 'solve') found in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' can provide a solution handling mechanism necessary for 'idiff,' though this span directly addresses the solving operation, crucial for operationalizing changes to 'idiff' to support 'Eq' and 'f(x)'. The function 'diff' in 'sympy/core/function.py' (span id 'diff') is also relevant, as it aids in managing derivatives, a critical component in making 'idiff' functional with 'Eq' and 'f(x)'. Finally, the code span in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' (span id 'find') discloses an auxiliary function that is indirectly relevant, exemplifying framework support functions that could align with broader efforts to support or reinforce 'idiff' handling of different input types. Overall, the analysis retrieves code spans that directly address the function 'idiff', appropriate solving mechanisms, and indirect support functions that collectively offer a comprehensive perspective on how to handle 'Eq' and 'f(x)' within the function.",
