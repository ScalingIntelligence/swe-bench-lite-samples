The first issue involves handling equations in the form of `Eq(y*exp(y), x*exp(x))`, where it fails due to an 'IndexError'. The second issue concerns handling equations where `f(x)` is used instead of `y`, leading to a 'ValueError'. The initial scan suggests that the `idiff` function is likely located in `sympy/geometry/util.py`. To address these issues, we need to locate the `idiff` function and review its implementation alongside any related functions that handle equations and symbolic differentiation. We should also check if there are specific patterns in the code that fail to account for these types of equations and the use of `f(x)`.",

This indicates that the function 'idiff' needs to be modified to handle these cases. 2. The current file context indicates that no relevant code has been identified yet. 3. The search results revealed the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py', which contains the logic for implicit differentiation. This function currently raises an error when encountering 'f(x)' and does not handle 'Eq' objects, which aligns with the reported issue. 4. The search also includes 'sympy/solvers/ode.py', specifically the 'imports' span, which lists the imports used in the file, including 'Eq' from 'sympy.core.relational'. This suggests that 'Eq' is used elsewhere in the codebase, which might be relevant for understanding how to handle 'Eq' within 'idiff'. 5. The 'dsolve' and 'classify_ode' functions in 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' might also be relevant, as they handle differential equations and classify them, which could provide insights into how to handle 'Eq' or 'f(x)' within 'idiff'. 6. The 'diff' function in 'sympy/core/function.py' is also relevant, as it defines how differentiation is handled in general, which might be necessary to understand how to modify 'idiff' to support 'Eq' and 'f(x)'.",

The code of `idiff` in the file context already addresses the second problem by raising a `ValueError` when expecting an `x`-dependent symbol but receiving `f(x)`. The function also attempts to handle the differentiation of equations by solving for the derivative and substituting back. However, the exact implementation for handling `Eq` objects directly is not shown in the file context; this could be a missing piece.

Both issues should be addressed to enhance the functionality of `idiff`. The provided context includes the current implementation of `idiff` in `sympy/geometry/util.py`, which checks if the dependent variable is a symbol and raises an error if it isn't. This is likely the cause of the issue with handling `f(x)`. The search results show relevant code spans in `sympy/core/function.py` (specifically, `Function._diff_wrt` and `diff`) and `sympy/geometry/util.py` (continuation of `idiff`). These spans, along with the main context, seem to cover the necessary components to address the modifications needed for `idiff`. Therefore, these spans will be identified as relevant to the reported issue. However, the search results do not reveal any direct references to handling `Eq` or enhancing the support for non-symbol dependent variables within the `idiff` function. Thus, the search task might not be complete, but it provides a starting point for the necessary modifications for `idiff`. The identified spans provide a clear path to modifying `idiff` to better handle `f(x)` expressions by improving the handling of dependence on variables within the function.",
