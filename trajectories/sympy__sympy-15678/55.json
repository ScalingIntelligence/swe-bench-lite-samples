The errors indicate that `idiff` does not adequately handle cases where the variable to be differentiated is an `Eq` object or a function `f(x)`. The relevant code spans from the `idiff` function in `sympy/geometry/util.py` are all identified as pertinent because they directly pertain to the functionality and potential corrections needed for `idiff` to handle `Eq` and `f(x)`. Specifically, the part of the code where `idiff` is defined clearly outlines how it processes inputs and handles differentiation, which is central to fixing the issues mentioned. The other functions and imports in `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/solvers/ode.py` are more related to generic differentiation (`diff`) and solving ODEs (`dsolve`), respectively, and though they provide broader context for understanding the SymPy framework, they do not directly address the current issue with `idiff`. The core action needed to resolve the issue is within the `idiff` function itself.",

The provided context and search results were analyzed to identify relevant code spans.\n2. The initial file context provided 'idiff' from 'sympy/geometry/util.py', which handles implicit differentiation. This function is central to the issue as it currently raises errors for certain input types.\n3. New search results include functions like 'diff' and 'expand' from 'sympy/core/function.py' which are generic and not directly related to 'idiff' functionality.\n4. The 'dsolve', 'classify_ode', and 'check_nonlinear_2eq_order1' functions from 'sympy/solvers/ode.py' appear relevant as they deal with differential equations, which may interact with or inform the handling of 'Eq' and 'f(x)' in 'idiff'.\n5.
