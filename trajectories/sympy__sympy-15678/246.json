Given the context and the tracebacks, it's evident that the 'idiff' function is located within the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file. For the first problem, it seems 'idiff' expects a direct equation rather than one wrapped in 'Eq'. For the second, 'idiff' might be checking for 'y' explicitly instead of handling 'f(x)' types. It's likely that the logic for handling these cases needs to be adjusted within the 'idiff' function in 'sympy/geometry/util.py'. There might also be related helper functions within the same module.",
