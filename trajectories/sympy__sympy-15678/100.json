This code is likely relevant because it contains the implementation logic for 'idiff' and directly addresses the types of inputs and handling mechanisms mentioned in the issue. Specifically, the function includes checks for symbol types and raises a 'ValueError' when it encounters an 'f(x)' type input, which matches the reported issue. Therefore, these code spans should be considered relevant to resolving the reported issues.\n\nBased on the analysis, the 'idiff' function's definition in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file is identified as relevant.
