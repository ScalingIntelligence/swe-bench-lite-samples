Specifically, the function raises a 'ValueError' if 'y' is not an 'x-dependent symbol', which suggests the function might not be designed (or tested) to handle non-symbol 'y' inputs like 'f(x)'. Additionally, the function uses 'solve' on the differential equation, which might not work as expected if 'eq' is an 'Eq' object rather than an expression.

The current implementation of 'idiff' in the file 'sympy/geometry/util.py' already handles the basic form of the function, but it does not account for the specific cases mentioned in the issue. The code spans provided in the search results are consistent with the context provided, and they indeed contain the implementation of 'idiff'. The function is supposed to handle differentiation of implicit functions, but it fails with the given examples. To address the issue, the function needs to be modified to handle instances of Eq and to accept functions like f(x) as dependent variables. The relevant code spans from the search results are the ones that define the 'idiff' function since they need to be adjusted to accommodate the reported issues.",
