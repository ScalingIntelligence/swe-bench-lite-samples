Based on the stack traces provided, the errors are occurring in the `sympy/geometry/util.py` file within the `idiff` function. The first error is due to an `IndexError` when trying to solve a differential equation, suggesting a potential issue with how `solve` is being used in the `idiff` function. The second error is a `ValueError` indicating that `idiff` expects an x-dependent symbol but receives a function `f(x)`. These issues need to be addressed in the `idiff` function definition. Therefore, the search should focus on the `idiff` function within `sympy/geometry/util.py` to identify and correct the specific lines causing these errors.",

From the search results, it's clear that the idiff function is located in the sympy/geometry/util.py file. The code spans provided directly relate to the processing and handling of the input parameters and the differentiation logic. The provided code spans include the main body of the idiff function, which is critical for addressing the issues described, such as the handling of the input 'y' and the differentiation process. Specifically, the code checks if 'y' is a sequence or a symbol and raises an appropriate error if it's not an x-dependent symbol. This directly corresponds to the second issue where idiff doesn't handle f(x) correctly. Additionally, the differentiation logic involving solve and subs methods are central to the first issue, as they are responsible for differentiating the equations, which currently fail for Eq objects. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant and should be examined further for potential corrections.",
