The first problem is that 'idiff' does not handle equations provided in the 'Eq' form, and the second is that it does not support the use of 'f(x)' instead of 'y'. The stack traces indicate errors in the 'idiff' function in the 'sympy/geometry/util.py' file. To address these issues, we need to locate the 'idiff' function and related parts of the code in 'sympy/geometry/util.py' and potentially 'sympy/solvers/ode.py'. Additionally, we should check the handling of equations in the 'Eq' form and the use of function symbols like 'f(x)'.",

The file also references other parts of the codebase (e.g., 'sympy/solvers/ode.py') that handle equation solving and ODEs. This suggests that while the immediate context for 'idiff' is complete, additional context from other files might be needed to fully address the issue across the entire codebase. However, based on the immediate task of determining if the provided file context contains all relevant code related to the issue at hand, the answer is yes. It includes the 'idiff' function along with necessary parts that define its behavior and potential areas for modification.
