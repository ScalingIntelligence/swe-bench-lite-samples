The function fails when handling equations in `Eq` form and when dealing with expressions like `f(x)` instead of `y`. The stack traces indicate that the issues occur in the `idiff` function within the `sympy/geometry/util.py` file. This suggests that the primary focus should be on files involving differential equations and symbolic manipulation, especially those related to the `idiff` function. Therefore, we should search for files containing the `idiff` function and also look into files related to solving ODEs, as they may contain relevant error handling or functionality enhancement.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue outlines two primary problems with the idiff function in the sympy library. Firstly, it does not support the use of Eq from the sympy library directly, leading to a Traceback due to an 'IndexError: list index out of range'. Secondly, it does not support functions such as f(x) instead of the symbol y, causing a 'ValueError: expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: f(x)'. The provided code snippet from sympy/geometry/util.py contains the function idiff which is likely where these issues are originating from. The code handles the differentiation of an equation with respect to x, considering the explicit dependencies on x. It first checks whether y is a sequence or a symbol and raises a ValueError if it is neither, which corresponds to the second issue's type error. The IndexError from the first issue might be due to the solve function returning an empty list, leading to the indexing error when attempting to access the first element at [0]. This portion of the code should be examined and possibly modified to handle the Eq class and ensure that functions like f(x) are correctly interpreted as x-dependent symbols. Overall, the search results have a high relevance to the reported issues and should be examined thoroughly for corrections.",
