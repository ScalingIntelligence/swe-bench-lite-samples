The issue mentions that 'idiff' doesn't support handling 'Eq' objects and also doesn't support functions like 'f(x)' in place of 'y'. The tracebacks provided indicate errors when using 'Eq' and 'f(x)' directly with 'idiff', with one error being an 'IndexError' and the other a 'ValueError'. Given this context, it's clear that the relevant code spans should include the 'idiff' function definition. This function is responsible for implicit differentiation and includes logic to handle symbolic computations, which is the core functionality underlying the reported issue. Additionally, the error handling part of the function, which raises the 'ValueError', is particularly relevant as it directly addresses the case when the input is not an 'x-dependent symbol'. Therefore, the entire 'idiff' function span is relevant to solving the reported issue.",
