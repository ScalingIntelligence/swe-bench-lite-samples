From the search results, several key spans are identified as relevant: The `_font_to_ps_type3` and `_font_to_ps_type42` functions handle the conversion of fonts to PostScript Type 3 and Type 42, respectively. The `RendererPS` class and the `FigureCanvasPS` class are also relevant, as they deal with the rendering and canvas aspects related to PostScript. However, the most pertinent span is `FigureCanvasPS._print_figure`, which directly handles the saving of figures and includes the error trace's context. This span is where the TypeError is likely occurring. The additional information suggests that adding a check for `curr_stream` before line 669 of `backend_ps.py` might fix the bug, indicating that the issue is related to the handling of the `stream` object.
