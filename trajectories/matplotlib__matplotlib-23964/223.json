The error likely occurs because 'curr_stream' is None at some point, which causes the for loop over 'stream' to fail in line 736 as mentioned in the additional information. \n\nGiven the additional information, adding a check 'if curr_stream:' before line 669 in the draw_text method could potentially fix the issue by ensuring that only non-None streams are appended to the 'stream' list.",
