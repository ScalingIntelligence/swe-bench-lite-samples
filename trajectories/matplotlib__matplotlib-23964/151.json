The first path uses AFM fonts and processes each character individually. The second path, which is more relevant to this issue, uses TrueType fonts and breaks the text into lines, subsequently processing each line into glyphs. The error message 'cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object' suggests that somewhere within the loop that processes text items, a None value is being encountered where an iterable (like a list or tuple) is expected. Given the focus on multi-line text handling and the importance of properly addressing empty lines, the code segment where text is laid out and then processed into streams for PostScript requires special attention. There, we find the logic which, potentially, might not properly handle empty lines or may fail to initiate a stream (resulting in `curr_stream` being `None`) under certain conditions. This could be due to various reasons like encountering an empty line which in turn makes the interpreter believe that text processing is done, hence a 'None' assignment. Consequently, this leads to a breakdown while execution tries to unpack a none-iterable struct. To mitigate this, we should implement checks that ensure `curr_stream` is not `None` before attempting to operate on it within the loop.",

The relevant part of the code shows how text is processed and rendered in the PostScript format. The code iterates over the characters in the text label, constructs a stream of PostScript commands, and writes them to the output. The error suggests that a NoneType object is being unpacked where an iterable is expected. This implies that somewhere in the text processing or rendering, a None value is being handled incorrectly.

The method has different paths for handling text, depending on whether AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) fonts or TrueType fonts are used. The section related to TrueType fonts, where text is broken into lines and processed into streams, is particularly relevant as it appears to be the source of the TypeError 'cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object'. The provided code already includes checks to ensure that `curr_stream` is not `None` before attempting to operate on it within the loop. This suggests that the potential fix discussed in the reported issue (adding a check before line 669) is already partially implemented.
