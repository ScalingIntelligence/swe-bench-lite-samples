The stack trace indicates that the error occurs in the 'draw_text' method of the RendererPS class in 'backend_ps.py'. Specifically, the TypeError arises from trying to unpack a non-iterable NoneType object. Upon examining the code, it's clear that the 'stream' variable, which is supposed to contain tuples for each text element, could potentially be None if 'curr_stream' is None in the final append operation. This would cause the 'for ps_name, xs_names in stream:' loop to fail. Based on the issue description and the suggested fix ('adding if curr_stream: before line 669'), it's evident that the problem lies in the handling of 'curr_stream' in the else block where TTF fonts are processed. Therefore, the relevant code span is the processing block within the draw_text method that involves TTF fonts and the handling of 'curr_stream'. This section of the code is crucial for understanding and fixing the bug.",
