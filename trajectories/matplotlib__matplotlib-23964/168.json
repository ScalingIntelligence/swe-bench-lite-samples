Given the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'backend_ps.py' file, specifically within the 'RendererPS.draw_text' method. This method processes text for rendering in the PostScript format. The problematic part seems to be the handling of the 'stream' variable, which is used to collect text rendering instructions. The issue likely occurs when 'curr_stream' becomes None, causing the iteration over 'stream' to fail. The identified code spans include the entire 'draw_text' method, focusing on the generation and manipulation of the 'stream' variable and its contents, as it's central to the text rendering process and directly related to the reported error. This code section should be reviewed and modified to ensure that 'curr_stream' is not None before attempting to process it.",
