The error message indicates that the issue arises from attempting to unpack a non-iterable NoneType object. This suggests that the 'stream' variable, which should be an iterable containing tuples of font information and glyph positions, is somehow being assigned a None value during the text rendering process. The relevant parts of the code, particularly in the 'draw_text' method of the 'RendererPS' class, involve processing the text string, laying it out line by line, and then generating the PostScript commands to render each glyph. The provided search results confirm the presence of the 'draw_text' method where the problematic code span is likely located, specifically within the block handling text rendering when 'ps.useafm' is False. This method iterates over the layout items of the text string, appends the font and glyph information to the 'stream' variable, and attempts to iterate over 'stream' to generate PostScript commands. Given the issue description, it is plausible that 'stream' might be None if the text processing encounters an empty line or some other edge case that isn't handled properly. Furthermore, the suggestion to add a check 'if curr_stream:' before appending to 'stream' indicates that the problem might be due to 'curr_stream' not being initialized or set when expected. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those where 'stream' and 'curr_stream' are manipulated, specifically the code within the 'else' block handling the non-AFM case in the 'draw_text' method, as well as any initialization or assignment of 'curr_stream'.",
