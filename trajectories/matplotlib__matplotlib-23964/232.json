The method processes text labels, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Within the 'draw_text' method, the code handles text processing and rendering for both AFM and TTF fonts. The section of code that processes TTF fonts is of particular interest, as it iterates through text items and maintains a 'curr_stream' variable that is later added to the 'stream' list. The error suggests that 'curr_stream' can sometimes be 'None', leading to the TypeError.
