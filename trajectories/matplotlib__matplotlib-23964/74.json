The error traceback shows that the issue is related to text handling in the PostScript backend, specifically in the 'draw_text' method of the 'RendererPS' class. The targeted method processes text labels and streams, where the error occurs when trying to unpack a NoneType object from an 'if' condition that checks for a nil stream (in fact, by adding an 'if curr_stream:' before this unpack attempt, the bug seems to be fixed as per user indications). From the provided search results, the 'RendererPS' class and its method 'draw_text' appear to be directly involved with this process. The method integrates and processes fonts, characters, streams, then renders text in PostScript format, which perfectly aligns with the patterns described in the issue. As the reported issue directly refers to enhancements to the 'RendererPS' class, especially around text rendering and stream handling, these sections are the most relevant pieces of code for addressing this issue, suggesting that any solution will very likely be built around these code components.",
