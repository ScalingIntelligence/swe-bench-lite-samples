The context provided suggests that the issue might be related to the handling of the 'stream' variable, which could be None in certain scenarios, leading to the TypeError. The provided search results contain the RendererPS class with its draw_text method, where the line in question is present. The method processes text labels and includes logic to handle different types of text rendering, including TeX and MathText. The relevant code spans include the RendererPS class declaration, the draw_text method, and the logic within draw_text to handle multi-line text labels, which includes processing the 'stream' variable. These spans provide the necessary context to understand how text labels are rendered and handled in the PostScript backend, specifically in relation to the reported issue.
