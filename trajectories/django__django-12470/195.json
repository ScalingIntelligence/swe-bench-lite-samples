The expected behavior is that querying the Child model should order by Parent's primary key in descending order (DESC), but it is ordering in ascending order (ASC). To address this, we need to investigate how Django handles Meta.ordering in inherited models and how the query is constructed. We should focus on the files that deal with model inheritance and query construction, specifically looking at methods related to ordering and query generation.",

Specifically, the Parent model has Meta ordering set to ['-pk'], which should result in descending order by primary key. However, when querying the Child model, the ordering is ascending instead of descending. The search results include relevant sections from Django's Query and QuerySet classes, which are responsible for SQL query construction and execution. Focusing on the Query class, the 'Query.join_parent_model' method is particularly relevant as it handles joining parent models, which is key to understanding how the ordering is applied. Additionally, the 'Query.add_ordering' method is directly related to applying ordering to queries. In the QuerySet class, the 'QuerySet.order_by' method is relevant as it allows explicit ordering to be set on a QuerySet, which should match or override the default ordering from the model's Meta class. These methods should be examined to ensure that the ordering specified in the model's Meta class is correctly applied when querying derived or related models. Therefore, the spans identified as relevant include 'Query.join_parent_model', 'Query.add_ordering', and 'QuerySet.order_by' to ensure a comprehensive view of how ordering is handled in Django's ORM.",

This method indicates that it handles the resolution of ordering arguments provided and adds them to the query's order_by attribute. Additionally, in 'django/db/models/query.py', the 'order_by' method of the QuerySet class calls 'add_ordering' via the query object, supporting the interaction between the model's Meta ordering and the generated SQL query.
