The reported issue points to a mismatch between the expected ordering ('DESC' based on '-pk') and the actual ordering ('ASC' as seen in the query). We need to identify the parts of Django's codebase that deal with query construction and particularly the handling of Meta ordering attributes during the query compilation. The search results reveal several key spans of code: 1. `Query.__init__` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` which initializes various properties related to the query, including how ordering is managed. 2. `Query.add_ordering` in the same file, which adds ordering to the query. 3. `SQLCompiler.__init__` and `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which involve the compilation of SQL queries including how ordering is processed and rendered into SQL. These spans should be further investigated to understand how Meta ordering, especially when inherited, is handled and how it affects the child model's query. The `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` is particularly important as it constructs the SQL order by clause and applies any ordering specified in the model's Meta class, making it a good candidate for issues related to ordering inheritance. These findings help in identifying the parts of the codebase critical to the issue at hand and can guide in determining if additional parts of the code need to be reviewed or if the issue can be ascribed to how these particular code spans handle inherited ordering.",

Specifically, when querying the Child model which inherits from Parent, the expected ordering by '-pk' (descending primary key) is not being applied correctly. The query results in ASC (ascending) ordering instead of DESC (descending) as specified in the Parent model's Meta class ordering attribute.\n\nFrom the provided code snippets, several key points are relevant to the issue:\n1. The `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` has methods that handle ordering (`get_order_by` and `add_ordering`).\n2. The `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` has a method `get_order_by` that determines the order for the query.\n3. The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` is involved in initializing instances, which might be relevant if the issue arises during instance creation or querying.\n\nTo address the issue, it is crucial to check how the ordering is being read from the `Meta` class of the Parent model and how it is being applied to the query for the Child model. The `get_order_by` method in `SQLCompiler` seems to be the central point where the ordering is determined, especially how it handles Meta class ordering from parent models.\n\nSince the initial context provided already includes relevant sections from `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, additional examination of these sections in the new search results confirms their relevance. The `get_meta` method in the `Query` class (span id='Query.get_meta') is particularly relevant as it directly accesses the model's Meta class, which sets the expected ordering.",
