This issue likely involves the handling of inherited model ordering in the Django ORM. The focus should be on examining the code related to model inheritance, meta options, and SQL ordering in the Django source code. Specifically, files such as `base.py`, `options.py`, `query.py`, `expressions.py`, and possibly others related to meta options and SQL query construction should be inspected for logic handling inherited ordering options.",

The issue states that the ordering specified in 'Parent.Meta.ordering' (\"-pk\") is not correctly applied to the 'Child' model, resulting in an ascending order instead of descending. We should focus on the 'Options' class in 'django/db/models/options.py' which handles the Meta attributes of a model, and the 'Query' class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' which constructs the SQL query. Additionally, we should examine the 'QuerySet' class in 'django/db/models/query.py' since it manages the ordering of queryset results. The spans 'Options.__init__' and 'Options.get_fields' in 'django/db/models/options.py' are relevant as they initialize and retrieve the Meta options of a model. The 'Query.join_parent_model' and 'Query.add_ordering' spans in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' are crucial as they manage joining parent models and adding ordering to the query. Finally, the 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' span in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' and 'QuerySet.order_by' in 'django/db/models/query.py' are important as they compile the SQL for ordering and apply ordering to the queryset respectively.

The user expects the ordering to be descending when specified as '-pk' in the Parent model's Meta class, but the query is ordering ascending instead. The relevant code spans involve the handling of model inheritance and ordering in the Django ORM. The provided search results include several key areas in the Django source code related to model options (Options class), SQL query construction (Query class), and SQL compilation (SQLCompiler class). Specifically, code spans related to the Options class's __init__, _populate_directed_relation_graph, and get_fields methods, the Query class's __init__, join_parent_model, and add_ordering methods, and the SQLCompiler class's __init__, setup_query, and get_order_by methods are highly relevant. These areas deal with parsing and applying ordering from the model's Meta class, managing model inheritance in queries, and compiling SQL queries with correct ordering. Further analysis of these code spans will help identify where and how the ordering is applied during query construction and compilation, potentially leading to the root cause of the issue. Additionally, code spans in the QuerySet class related to ordering methods (order_by, distinct, extra, reverse) are also pertinent, as they interact directly with the query's ordering.",

The provided code context involves several key files that could be relevant, such as `options.py`, `query.py`, `compiler.py`, and `query.py`. These files contain logic for model options, query construction, SQL compilation, and query execution. Initial observations indicate that the `Options` class in `options.py` handles model meta options, potentially including ordering. The `Query` class in `query.py` manages the construction of SQL queries, possibly including the handling of inherited ordering. The `SQLCompiler` class in `compiler.py` is responsible for compiling SQL queries, including applying ordering. Given these insights, focusing on methods related to handling inherited meta options, ordering during query construction, and compiling these orders into SQL is crucial. Specifically, methods like `get_fields`, `join_parent_model`, `add_ordering`, `get_order_by`, and `order_by` are pertinent to the investigation.",
