The inheritance mechanism seems to not correctly apply the ordering from the parent model to the child model. The search results include key sections from Django's models framework, specifically focusing on the model creation and Meta attribute handling. The 'ModelBase.__new__' span in 'django/db/models/base.py' is crucial as it handles the creation of model classes and the inheritance of Meta attributes, including ordering. Similarly, the 'Options._prepare' span in 'django/db/models/options.py' is relevant as it prepares the model options, which might include the ordering attribute. Additionally, the 'Query.add_ordering' span in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is pertinent as it deals with how ordering is applied in database queries, which might be where the expected 'DESC' ordering is not being respected. These sections of code are directly related to the issue described and will help in understanding and potentially debugging the problem.",

From the search results, the relevant code spans are found in both 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/options.py'. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the '__new__' method of the 'ModelBase' class handles the creation of new model classes, including the inheritance of Meta attributes from parent classes. Specifically, the ordering attribute is inherited here if not specified in the child model's Meta class. The code ensures that if the parent model has an ordering attribute, it is inherited by the child model unless explicitly overridden. In 'django/db/models/options.py', the '__init__' method of the 'Options' class initializes the model's metadata, including the ordering attribute from the Meta class. Further, the '_get_fields' method retrieves fields, which is relevant for understanding where ordering might be applied in the query generation. Identifying these spans is crucial for understanding how ordering is inherited and how it affects the query generation in Django models.

If an `ordering` attribute is specified in the Meta class of a parent model, it doesn't appear to be automatically propagated to the child model within the inheritance chain, at least not directly within the `_prepare` method. It's crucial to ensure proper handling of inherited Meta options like `ordering`, which might involve reviewing and possibly extending or enhancing the logic related to how Meta options are processed during model inheritance. Probing deeper into methods that deal with the inheritance mechanism and Meta options such as `_get_fields` and `get_fields`, along with the overall logic in `ModelBase`, is likely to yield more insights and possibly relevant code snippets where the propagation and handling of `ordering` in the context of model inheritance might be explicitly addressed or currently missing.",

The `ModelBase` class in `django/db/models/base.py` is responsible for creating the model classes and it's here that much of the initial setup for Meta options occurs. However, it appears that there isn't explicit handling for propagating `ordering` from parent to child models within the `ModelBase` class itself. The `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` is where model options are managed, but the `_prepare` method, which handles the `order_with_respect_to` option, does not specifically address the propagation of the `ordering` option. The `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, specifically the `add_ordering` method, handles adding ordering to querysets but does not address the issue of inheritance of ordering from parent to child models. This suggests that the core issue might not be explicitly addressed in these parts of the Django codebase. To find a solution or further relevant code snippets, one might need to delve into how Django models handle their initialization and how they inherit and merge Meta options from parent models.",
