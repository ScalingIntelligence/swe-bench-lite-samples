This discrepancy suggests a problem in how Django handles ordering in inherited models. The focus should be on the Django core modules, particularly those related to model definitions, query construction, and SQL compilation, as these are the areas likely responsible for managing ordering in model queries.",

            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue regarding the ordering of the Child model inheriting from the Parent model with a Meta ordering of ['-pk'], we need to analyze how Django handles model inheritance and Meta ordering. The issue indicates that the ordering is not correctly being applied in descending order when querying the Child model. We need to inspect the relevant parts of Django's codebase that deal with model inheritance and the application of ordering meta options. From the provided search results, several key files and spans are potentially relevant:\n\n1. `django/db/models/base.py` - This file contains the ModelBase and Model classes, which are fundamental to Django's model system and how models are defined and instantiated. The Model class's `__init__` method is especially relevant as it initializes model instances, which indirectly involves dealing with the Meta options.\n\n2. `django/db/models/options.py` - This file contains the Options class, which handles model options (like ordering) passed through the Meta inner class. The `__init__`, `_populate_directed_relation_graph`, and `get_fields` methods are particularly relevant as they manage model options and relations.\n\n3. `django/db/models/sql/query.py` - This file contains the Query class, which is responsible for constructing SQL queries based on the model definitions and query operations. The `join_parent_model` and `add_ordering` methods are likely to be involved in handling joins between parent and child models and applying ordering to queries, respectively.\n\n4. `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` - This file contains the SQLCompiler class, which compiles Query objects into SQL strings. The `get_order_by` method is particularly relevant as it directly deals with how the SQL ordering is applied based on the model's Meta ordering.\n\nBy examining these spans, we can understand how Django processes and applies ordering options across different aspects of model definition and SQL query construction. This will help in identifying the part of the code that might not be correctly applying the descending ordering specified in the Parent model's Meta class to queries on the Child model.",
