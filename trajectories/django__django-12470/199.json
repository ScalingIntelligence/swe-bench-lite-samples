The expected behavior is for the ordering to be descending (DESC) based on the primary key, but the actual query shows ascending (ASC) ordering. This discrepancy suggests a need to investigate how Django handles Meta class ordering in inherited models and how queries incorporate this ordering in the resulting SQL. Focus is on understanding the interactions in the Django ORM related to model inheritance, attribute handling, and SQL query generation. Search targets primarily focus on the handling of model Meta attributes, particularly ordering, and how these are processed in the context of inherited models during query compilation.",

The main focus should be on the Meta class configuration and how Django processes the ordering property in the inheritance context.\n\nFrom the search results, several key areas are relevant:\n1. django/db/models/options.py - Shows the Options class which likely processes the Meta options for models. The '__init__' method initializes the 'ordering' property which is crucial for this issue.\n2. django/db/models/base.py - Displays the Model class and its '__init__' method. This class is fundamental in understanding how model instances are created and how Meta options like 'ordering' might be handled.\n3. django/db/models/sql/query.py - Contains the Query class with methods like 'join_parent_model' and 'add_ordering'. These are critical for SQL generation and ordering.\n4. django/db/models/sql/compiler.py - The SQLCompiler class's 'get_order_by' method is responsible for compiling the order_by clause into SQL, making it a key part of this issue.\n5. django/db/models/query.py - The QuerySet class's 'order_by' method allows explicit ordering which might override or complement the Meta ordering.\n\nBased on these findings, the identified span_ids highlight sections of code in the Options and Query classes which directly involve the handling and application of the 'ordering' Meta property, essential for resolving the reported issue.",
