This suggests a deeper issue in how Django handles inherited model ordering. To investigate, it's essential to look into the areas where model inheritance and ordering are managed in Django. This includes checking the logic in 'ModelBase', 'Model', and related methods that handle ordering, such as 'get_ordering_field' in 'ChangeList', and 'add_ordering' in 'Query'. Additionally, we need to verify how 'Options' and 'QuerySet' manage and apply ordering from inherited models. Understanding these components will help in identifying why the ordering is being applied incorrectly.",

To address this, we need to examine the Django framework's internal handling of model inheritance and meta options, especially focusing on how ordering is applied and inherited.\n\nFrom the search results, we see three files that may contain relevant code spans: 'django/contrib/admin/views/main.py', 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', and 'django/db/models/options.py'. The 'ChangeList' class in 'main.py' doesn't directly relate to the issue but provides context on how Django admin handles ordering.\n\nThe 'Query' class in 'query.py' handles SQL query construction, which is crucial for understanding how ordering is applied to querysets. The 'add_ordering' method, in particular, may be relevant to how '-pk' ordering is processed.\n\nThe 'Options' class in 'options.py' is responsible for holding meta-attributes about Django models, including ordering. The '__init__' and '_prepare' methods could help understand how Meta options like ordering are initialized and inherited by child models.\n\nIdentified code spans include 'Query.__init__', 'Query.join_parent_model', 'Query.add_ordering', 'Options.__init__', 'Options._prepare', 'Options.get_base_chain', 'Options.get_parent_list', and 'Options.get_fields'.

The expected behavior is for the resulting query to order by '-pk' (descending) but it is actually ordering by 'pk' (ascending). Key areas to focus on are the Meta class behavior, the Query class, and how ordering is handled in the Django ORM. From the existing context, there are code spans in django/db/models/sql/query.py that deal with ordering and joining parent models. In the new search results, there are relevant code spans in django/db/models/base.py that indicate how the Meta options are prepared and how ordering might be affected by inheritance. Additionally, there are spans in django/contrib/admin/views/main.py that show how ordering is handled in the admin ChangeList view. Combining these insights, the identified code spans should provide a good basis to investigate and potentially resolve the issue with ordering in inherited models.",

It's also worth examining 'Options' in 'django/db/models/options.py', particularly the '_prepare' method where the ordering is potentially set up for inherited models. Additionally, the 'ModelBase' class in 'django/db/models/base.py' prepares the model class, which includes handling of ordering in relation to inheritance.

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nUpon examining the reported issue, it is clear that the problem revolves around the ordering of the 'Child' model not inheriting correctly from the 'Parent' model when the ordering is specified as '-pk'. The key elements from the reported issue are the model definitions and the SQL query output. The task is to identify where and how the ordering is being handled, specifically focusing on how the Meta class ordering attribute is being processed in model inheritance. \n\nFirst, I reviewed the Django's core files responsible for handling model options and query compilation. I examined spans related to Meta class processing, query compilation, and model inheritance. I observed that Django's Options class handles meta options for models, including ordering. The get_base_chain method in Options is crucial for model inheritance, and the _prepare method in ModelBase assembles fields from parent models. \n\nThe SQLCompiler's get_order_by method is responsible for compiling the ORDER BY clause based on model ordering.

The core functionalities examined include the Query class, Options class, and Model class, particularly focusing on their methods related to initialization, joining parent models, adding ordering, and preparing models.\n\nThe new search results largely overlap with the initial context, particularly in the ChangeList class in django/contrib/admin/views/main.py, which deals with ordering in admin change lists. Additionally, ModelAdmin in django/contrib/admin/options.py has methods handling ordering and change form views, which could be indirectly relevant to the reported issue. Also, the MultipleObjectMixin and BaseDateListView in django/views/generic/list.py and django/views/generic/dates.py, respectively, have methods to get ordering, which might influence the ordering behavior, but these are more general views and less directly related to model-specific ordering.\n\nGiven the relevance of the identified spans to the reported issue and their direct interaction with the core functionalities like model initialization, ordering setting, and query generation, these code spans are considered relevant. However, it's crucial to delve deeper into how these components interact, especially during inheritance and query execution, to pinpoint the exact location causing the ASC result instead of the expected DESC in the Child model's queries.",

The provided search results include various files such as django/db/models/base.py, django/db/models/query.py, etc., which contain code spans relevant to model initialization, ordering, and querying. These spans include the Model class, QuerySet class, and various methods related to ordering and model preparation. Notably, the Options class and its methods (_prepare, get_base_chain, get_parent_list) are crucial as they handle the Meta attributes and inheritance of ordering. The identified spans directly relate to the reported issue by involving the Meta class of models, the ordering attribute, and the handling of ordering in model inheritance. The analysis indicates that these spans are relevant to resolving the issue, suggesting that the search for relevant code is complete.",
