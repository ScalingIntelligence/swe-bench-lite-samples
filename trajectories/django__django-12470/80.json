The reported issue indicates that the expected ordering is DESC based on '-pk', but the actual query orders the results ASC. This discrepancy suggests that the Meta class ordering setting might not be properly propagated or interpreted in the query generation process. Consequently, our analysis should concentrate on the handling of the Meta.ordering attribute and its impact on the resulting SQL query. Given the provided search results, we can identify several critical spans within the Django framework codebase that pertain to model initialization, ordering checks, and query construction. These spans include Model.__init__, Model._check_ordering, Query.__init__, Query.join_parent_model, Query.add_ordering, and Options.get_base_chain. These sections are particularly relevant as they deal with model metadata, SQL query formation, and the integration of ordering options, making them crucial for identifying and potentially resolving the reported ordering issue.",

Furthermore, the `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` deals with various model options including ordering, which is directly related to the issue. The `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` involves SQL query construction and includes methods to manage the ordering of SQL queries, which suggests that changes or checks might need to be implemented here to ensure correct ordering in inherited models.

Specifically, we need to delve into how the `Options` class and the `Query` class interact when dealing with inherited ordering. The `get_base_chain` method in `Options` and the `join_parent_model` method in `Query` are critical for understanding how the inheritance tree is traversed and how ordering is applied. Additionally, examining other parts of the `Model` class to understand how inherited Meta options are processed during model initialization is important to grasp the complete picture of how ordering is applied. Given the context provided, the focus should be on the interactions between these methods and classes to identify where the ordering logic might be breaking down.",

This typically involves the model inheritance mechanism in Django and the logic that handles the ordering in the QuerySet. The search results provide various code spans that might be relevant to this issue, especially those that deal with model inheritance, setting up joins, and handling ordering in the Query class. Specifically, the 'Query.join_parent_model' and 'Query.add_ordering' methods are of high relevance as they directly handle joins between parent and child models and adding ordering to queries, respectively. Additionally, the 'Options.get_base_chain' method, which determines the chain of inheritance, could also be crucial in understanding how ordering is propagated through inheritance. The 'Model._check_ordering' method also checks for ordering-related errors, which could be relevant to debugging this issue.",

The expected behavior is for the ordering to be DESC, but it is observed as ASC. 2. Reviewing the current file context, it includes relevant code spans from 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' which are dealing with model initialization, ordering checks, and SQL query generation. 3. Analyzing the new search results: a. 'django/db/models/options.py' contains the Options class which manages meta options like ordering. Relevant spans include the initialization of the ordering attribute ('Options.__init__') and the method to get the base chain of models ('Options.get_base_chain'). b. 'django/db/models/base.py' has the '_check_ordering' method which checks for ordering errors, which is relevant to the issue. c. 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' has methods for joining parent models and adding ordering to SQL queries, which are crucial for understanding how ordering directives are implemented in SQL generation. 4. Since the new search results contain the key methods and logic related to model ordering and SQL query construction, they are highly relevant to the reported issue. These results provide deeper insight into how model inheritance and ordering options are processed and implemented in Django's ORM.",
