The expected behavior is to have the ordering in DESC, but the actual query shows it in ASC. To resolve this, the focus should primarily be on the models definition and how the ordering is handled during the querying process. Specifically, investigating the `ModelBase`, `QuerySet`, `SQLCompiler`, and `Options` classes and their relevant methods could provide insights into where the ordering logic might be failing for the inherited model.",

These sections handle the creation of models, the handling of ordering in queries, the compilation of SQL queries, and the management of model options respectively.
