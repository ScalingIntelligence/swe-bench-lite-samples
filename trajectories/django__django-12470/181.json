            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the ordering of the Child model not respecting the Meta ordering specified in the Parent model. Specifically, when querying the Child model, the ordering defaults to ASC instead of DESC as specified by the Parent model's Meta class ordering attribute. The search results provided include relevant code from the Django ORM's SQL compiler and query classes which handle the order by functionality. The relevant code spans involve the SQLCompiler class's `get_order_by` method and the Query class's `add_ordering` method. These methods are responsible for determining the ordering of the query results based on the model's Meta class ordering attribute. Analyzing these code spans provides insight into how the ordering is handled and why the desired DESC ordering might not be applied correctly when querying the Child model. It is crucial to note that the 'self.query.get_meta().ordering' is fetched and assigned to 'ordering', which affects how the SQL query is constructed, indicating a clear connection with the reported issue. This context implies that the codebase currently responds to the Metadata ordering but might have specific handling within inheritance mechanisms or during query compilation events that prevent the correct inheritance of ordering from the parent class. This observation also importantly aligns with the user's instruction highlighting the need to closely check the pertinent parts of the codebase. The relevance of the Meta ordering attribute setting is revisited when looking at how order_by orders rows based on specified conditions within the database query. This examination also evinces a direct interface with the reported issue. Additionally, the user's explanation of witnessing potentially broader application difficulties while implementing newly suggested functions into existing programs served as enlightening points. The utility of the current file context in this discussion actioned insights to technically review if any parent-child model interconnectedness corrections or updates are imperative, thus directing towards completing the task of diagnosing the codebase to ensure that the ordering schema across all dynamically assembled models is aptly remembered from Meta selections. In conclusion, these code spans distinctly point towards the essential area where the problem may manifest, providing a sound foundation for debugging the ordering discrepancy inherent in this case, while also vividly highlighting how future adjustments could improve the model inheritance dynamics to align more substantially with incoming functional demands.",

The SQLCompiler class and the Query class are particularly relevant as they deal with the conversion of Django model queries into SQL statements, including how ordering is applied. The presence of methods like 'get_order_by' within SQLCompiler and the handling of 'order_by' within the Query class suggest that the code related to ordering is central to these files. This indicates that the file context is likely relevant to the issue, as it involves how inherited models handle ordering.

The issue concerns the ordering of the 'Child' model inheriting from the 'Parent' model where the 'ordering' in Meta is specified as ['-pk']. The expected behavior is that querying the 'Child' model should order by '-pk' (descending), but the actual query orders by 'pk' (ascending). This discrepancy needs to be investigated in the Django codebase.\n\n- 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py':\n  - The 'SQLCompiler' class and its 'get_order_by' method seem relevant as they handle the ordering of queries.\n  - The 'get_order_by' method processes the ordering of fields, including the handling of the '-pk' specification.\n\n- 'django/db/models/sql/query.py':\n  - The 'Query' class and its 'join_parent_model' and 'add_ordering' methods appear relevant as they relate to joining parent models and adding ordering to queries.\n  - The 'join_parent_model' method manages the joining of parent models, which could impact how ordering is inherited.\n\n- 'django/db/models/base.py':\n  - The 'ModelBase' class and its '__new__', 'add_to_class', and '_prepare' methods seem relevant as they handle the creation and preparation of model classes.\n  - The '__new__' method handles the setup of model classes, including inheritance, which could influence how ordering settings are inherited.\n\nGiven the code spans provided, I will identify the relevant code spans that deal with ordering handling and model inheritance, specifically focusing on how the 'ordering' attribute in Meta is processed and applied to inherited models.",
