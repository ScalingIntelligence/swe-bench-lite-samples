            "scratch_pad": "I will start by understanding the reported issue which is about the incorrect ordering of model objects when specified with '-pk' in Parent.Meta.ordering. The expected behavior is that the query should order by 'id' descending (DESC), but it orders by 'id' ascending (ASC). The goal is to identify the relevant code spans within the search results that are responsible for setting up and managing the ordering of queries.\n\nFirst, I will examine the `Query.__init__` span in django/db/models/sql/query.py, which initializes various properties related to the SQL query, including `self.order_by`. This is relevant as it potentially sets the initial ordering of queries.\n\nNext, I will look at the `Query.add_ordering` span in django/db/models/sql/query.py, which explicitly states that it handles the addition of ordering rules to the query. This is crucial as it directly addresses how ordering within a query is managed.\n\nFinally, I will examine the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` span in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py. This function creates the `order_by` SQL clause when generating the SQL from the query. Given that this piece of code constructs the actual ordering part of the query, it is particularly relevant to the issue because determining how the 'ordering' from Meta is applied or inadvertently overridden here could resolve the problem.\n\nConsidering the initial context is empty, these are newly identified spans. I have chosen these spans specifically because they are involved in setting up the query, managing the order by clause, and finally compiling the SQL query with ordering details.\n\nThe identified spans are:`Query.__init__` which initializes the query including ordering setups, `Query.add_ordering` due to its direct handling of adding ordering to queries, as well as `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` for controlling the query ordering process, particularly how Meta ordering is applied. Thus, by working with these spans, I can further analyze or suggest changes to properly derive ordering according to Meta specified in the models.",
