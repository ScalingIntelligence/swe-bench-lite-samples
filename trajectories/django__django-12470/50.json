            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the ordering of models in Django. Specifically, the Child model inherits from the Parent model, which specifies `ordering = ['-pk']` in its Meta class. However, querying the Child model results in the order being 'ASC' instead of 'DESC' as expected. To resolve this issue, it's necessary to identify where the default ordering is being applied and how the inheritance of this ordering is handled in Django's ORM. Key files to inspect would be those related to model inheritance, meta options, and query construction. Notably, `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/options.py` are likely to hold relevant code sections.",

This implies a problem with how the ordering attribute in the Meta class is being handled or inherited by the Child model. Based on the search results, the relevant spans appear to be those related to model definition, specifically the handling of the Meta class attributes such as ordering. The spans 'Model._check_ordering' and 'Options.get_fields' are particularly relevant as they deal with the validation and retrieval of ordering settings within Django's model options framework. These sections of code are likely to be involved in ensuring that the ordering specified in the Meta class of the Parent model is correctly applied to the Child model. The 'Query.add_ordering' span is also relevant as it handles the addition of ordering to database queries, directly related to the issue of incorrect order by '-pk'. Despite this, more context or additional spans from the same or other files might be needed to fully understand and resolve the issue.",
