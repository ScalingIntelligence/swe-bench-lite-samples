Specifically, the Parent model defines 'ordering = [\"-pk\"]', but when querying the Child class (which inherits from Parent), the ordering is ascending instead of descending. This discrepancy suggests that the Meta.ordering attribute might not be properly inherited or applied. To investigate further, search parameters should focus on the models themselves and the methods or properties involved in managing model inheritance and ordering. Notably, the '_base_manager' property and the 'add_ordering' method appear relevant from the provided file context. Additionally, it's crucial to look into how the Options class handles ordering in the context of inherited models.",

Specifically, the Parent model has Meta.ordering set to ['-pk'], but when querying the Child model, the order is ASC rather than DESC. The key components to address in the search results are the definition and handling of the Meta class, specifically the 'ordering' attribute. The analysis of the code spans shows that the relevant models and their initialization, including the Meta class and its attributes, are found in 'base.py' and 'options.py'. The '__init__' methods in these files are critical for understanding how the Meta class is processed and how the ordering attribute might be inherited or overridden in the case of the Child model inheriting from the Parent model. Notably, the 'Options.__init__' method in 'options.py' initializes the 'ordering' attribute, which is crucial for the reported issue. Additionally, the 'Query.add_ordering' method in 'query.py' is relevant as it specifies how ordering is added to queries, which could be where the discrepancy arises in the ordering between Parent and Child models. Therefore, these code spans are directly related to the reported issue, providing insights into the model and query construction processes.",

Specifically, the 'Options.__init__' and 'Query.__init__' spans are relevant because they involve the initialization of the Meta class options and the Query class which constructs the SQL query, respectively. The 'add_ordering' method is also relevant as it deals with the addition of ordering to the query.

The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` handles the initialization of model instances and appears to set up the base structure for model inheritance. The `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` manages metadata for models, including ordering, which suggests this class might play a key role in how ordering is inherited or specified. Additionally, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` contains methods related to adding ordering (`add_ordering`), which is crucial for understanding how ordering is applied during query construction. To fully understand the issue of ordering not being correctly inherited, it's essential to focus on the interaction between these components, particularly how the `Options` class handles ordering and its interaction with the `Model` class during inheritance. Moreover, understanding the `add_ordering` method in the `Query` class will likely reveal how ordering specifications are interpreted and applied in the context of inherited models.",

The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` performs initialization and suggests that model initialization might not directly handle the inheritance of Meta attributes; instead, it might happen later in the process or through the `Options` class. The `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` is indeed responsible for managing metadata, but the code presented does not show how the `ordering` attribute is specifically handled during inheritance. The `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` contains the `add_ordering` method, which is essential for applying ordering during query construction, but it does not show where or how it receives the `ordering` attribute for inherited models. Given the complexity and lack of direct code spans addressing the issue, the next step would be to delve deeper into the `Options` class and potentially other related classes in Django's source code to fully understand how the `ordering` attribute is inherited and applied, particularly in the context of inherited models.",

The relevant code spans to focus on would be those that deal with Meta class processing, model inheritance, and query generation. In the provided file context and search results, we see code spans related to Options class (part of Meta processing), Query class (for SQL query generation), and Model class (for handling model initialization and inheritance). Specifically, the Options._prepare method, Options.get_fields method, and Options.fields_map property are relevant for understanding how Meta options are processed, particularly the ordering attribute. Additionally, the Query.add_ordering method and Model.__init__ method are relevant as they handle query generation and model initialization respectively, both of which could influence the ordering behavior.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided code spans, it seems sufficient to address the reported issue. The identified code spans cover the necessary areas of model initialization, Meta class processing, and query generation which collectively affect the ordering behavior observed in the reported issue.\n",

The `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` is indeed responsible for managing metadata, but the code presented does not show how the `ordering` attribute is specifically handled during inheritance. The `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` contains the `add_ordering` method, which is essential for applying ordering during query construction, but it does not show where or how it receives the `ordering` attribute for inherited models. Given the complexity and lack of direct code spans addressing the issue, the next step would be to delve deeper into the `Options` class and potentially other related classes in Django's source code to fully understand how the `ordering` attribute is inherited and applied, particularly in the context of inherited models.",
