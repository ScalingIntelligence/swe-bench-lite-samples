The issue specifically points to the behavior of the Child class inheriting from Parent, where the expected descending order of '-pk' is not being honored.\n\nFrom the search results, the 'django/db/models/base.py' file contains a significant part of the ModelBase class, which is crucial for understanding how model inheritance works in Django. The '__init__' method of the Model class is responsible for initializing the model instance, but it doesn't directly handle the ordering of the Model. The ordering specification is typically handled by the Meta class, which could be inherited by the Child model from the Parent model.\n\nThe 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file contains the Query class, which is crucial for how queries are constructed and executed. The 'add_ordering' method in this file is particularly relevant as it is responsible for adding ordering to queries. This method determines how ordering is added to the SQL query, and it directly involves the Meta.ordering attribute from the model.\n\nFinally, the 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' file contains the SQLCompiler class, specifically the 'get_order_by' method. This method constructs the ORDER BY clause in the SQL query. It uses the ordering information from the query object, which could include inherited ordering from a parent model.\n\nGiven the complexity of model inheritance and the way ordering is handled in Django, the identified spans provide a good starting point to investigate further. The spans in the ModelBase, Query, and SQLCompiler classes seem most relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue related to inherited ordering in Django models.",
