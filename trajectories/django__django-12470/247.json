This involves checking how Django handles ordering in inherited models, particularly focusing on the logic that translates the Meta.ordering attribute into SQL queries. The relevant files seem to be those handling model definitions, SQL query compilation, and the logic that applies ordering in QuerySets. Search should focus on these areas to understand how Django handles inherited ordering.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the ordering behavior in Django models, specifically when dealing with inherited models. The expected ordering is 'DESC' based on the 'pk' field, but the actual query orders by 'ASC'. To resolve this, we need to identify code spans that handle model ordering and inheritance. The analysis of the provided search results reveals several key areas related to model ordering and inheritance handling:\n\n1. **django/db/models/base.py** - This file contains the `Model` class with methods related to ordering checks (`_check_ordering`) and order management (`_get_next_or_previous_in_order`). These spans are relevant because they directly deal with model ordering and can impact how inherited models handle ordering.\n\n2. **django/db/models/sql/query.py** - This file includes the `Query` class with methods that handle query ordering (`add_ordering`, `clear_ordering`). Given the nature of the issue, these methods are critical for understanding how ordering is applied to queries and how it might be influenced by model inheritance.\n\n3. **django/db/models/query.py** - Here, the `QuerySet` class includes methods like `order_by`, which are directly related to the ordering of queryset results. This is particularly relevant as it shows how ordering is applied from a queryset perspective, which can be influenced by model Meta ordering settings.\n\n4. **django/db/models/sql/compiler.py** - This file contains the `SQLCompiler` class, with methods that translate query ordering into SQL (`get_order_by`). Understanding how ordering instructions are compiled into SQL is crucial for diagnosing issues where the ordering settings might not be correctly interpreted.\n\nAfter analyzing these areas, it's clear these spans are relevant to the reported issue. Specifically, understanding how the Meta class's ordering attribute interacts with the underlying query and SQL generation process is key to resolving the discrepancy in ordering direction.",

The expected ordering is 'DESC' but the actual ordering is 'ASC'. This issue involves understanding how Django handles model inheritance and the application of ordering from parent to child models. The relevant code spans identified in the search results include the 'Model._check_ordering' method which checks for ordering validity, the 'Query.__init__' method which initializes query attributes including ordering, and the 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' method which determines the actual SQL used for ordering. These methods are crucial for understanding how Django processes and applies ordering in queries. Additionally, the 'Query.add_ordering' and 'Query.clear_ordering' methods from 'query.py' and the 'QuerySet.order_by' method from 'query.py' are relevant as they deal directly with the manipulation of ordering in a QuerySet. These methods are essential for manipulating the ordering behavior of a QuerySet, which is central to the reported issue.

This affects the Child model but doesn't respect the descending order as expected. The search results have provided several key pieces of information that are directly related to handling model ordering:\n\n1. **Model._check_ordering**: This method checks for valid ordering fields in the Meta class. It confirms that the ordering and order_with_respect_to cannot be used together and ensures the ordering field is a tuple or list. It also checks for the existence of the fields specified in the ordering.\n\n2. **Query.add_ordering and Query.clear_ordering**: These methods handle adding and clearing order_by arguments for the Query class. They are crucial for managing the ordering of the query objects.\n\n3. **QuerySet.order_by**: This method allows specifying the ordering of a QuerySet, which is crucial for ensuring queries respect the Meta.ordering of related models.\n\n4. **SQLCompiler.get_order_by**: This method compiles the ordering part of the SQL query, crucial for translating the ordering specified in Django's models to actual SQL ORDER BY clauses. It addresses various scenarios, including ordering by model fields, annotations, and custom SQL.\n\nGiven the above points, the identified spans are directly related to the handling and implementation of ordering in Django's ORM, which is critical for addressing the issue at hand.\n",
