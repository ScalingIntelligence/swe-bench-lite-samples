To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans responsible for handling model inheritance and ordering. The search results include several files from the Django codebase:\n\n1. **django/db/models/base.py**: Contains the ModelBase and Model classes which are fundamental for model definition and inheritance.\n2. **django/db/models/options.py**: Includes the Options class, which handles meta options for models, including ordering.\n3. **django/db/models/sql/query.py**: Contains the Query class responsible for SQL query generation, including ordering.\n4. **django/db/models/sql/compiler.py**: Includes the SQLCompiler class, which compiles SQL queries, including ordering.\n5. **django/db/models/query.py**: Contains the QuerySet class, which manages database query operations, including ordering.\n\nFrom these files, the important spans to consider are:\n- **django/db/models/base.py::ModelBase** and **Model**, which handle model class creation and instantiation.\n- **django/db/models/options.py::Options**, particularly the `ordering` attribute and related methods.\n- **django/db/models/sql/query.py::Query.add_ordering** and **Query.join_parent_model**, which manage ordering and joining parent models.\n- **django/db/models/sql/compiler.py::SQLCompiler.get_order_by**, which compiles the ORDER BY clause.\n- **django/db/models/query.py::QuerySet.order_by**, which allows ordering on QuerySets.\n\nGiven the reported issue, these spans collectively help understand how ordering is applied and how inherited models are handled in Django.

The `Options` class in `options.py` deals with model metadata, including ordering, but it also doesn't explicitly address the inheritance of ordering settings. The `Query` class in `query.py` and `SQLCompiler` class in `compiler.py` are more directly involved in compiling SQL queries, including handling of ordering. However, neither directly addresses the issue of inherited ordering not being applied correctly. The `QuerySet` class in `query.py` shows the `order_by` method, but this is more about applying new ordering criteria rather than managing inherited ordering.
