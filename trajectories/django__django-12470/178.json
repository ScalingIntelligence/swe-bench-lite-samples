            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it's clear that the expected behavior described in the issue arises from how Django handles model inheritance and ordering. The key elements identified in the issue are related to the way the Meta class's ordering attribute is being inherited and applied to the Child model, which should ideally follow the ordering defined in the Parent model. Specifically, there's a need to investigate the code mechanics that deal with model subclassing and ordering settings to understand why the Child model's ordering is not reflecting Parent's ordering in a descending manner. \n\nThoroughly examining the search results, several relevant sections of Django's source code come under scrutiny: \n\n1. Looks potentially relevant:\n- The ModelBase class's add_to_class method is likely where attributes, including those from Meta classes, are added or 'contributed' to a model during its creation.\n- The Model._check_ordering method is definitely pertinent as it pertains to checking and perhaps applying the ordering options to the model.\n\n2. Less directly relevant but provide context:\n- The QuerySet.order_by method contributes to how Django's database queries implement ordering at the queryset level, tied directly to user-facing query results.\n- Options, in django/db/models/options.py, is the class dealing with model options (Meta) which could be integral in understanding how options like 'ordering' are intended to work.\n\nHaving reviewed these sections, it's evident that the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue, as they directly pertain to model inheritance and ordering handling within Django models or query sets.\n\nOverall, the identified spans are relevant code sections that may contribute to understanding and potentially fixing the issue concerning model ordering in inherited models.",
