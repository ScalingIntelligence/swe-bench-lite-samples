Understanding the Django codebase helps identify which parts are crucial to investigate. The key sections are:\n\n1. The `ModelBase` metaclass, which is responsible for creating Django models. It handles the inheritance of model metadata, including the 'ordering' attribute.\n\n2. The `Model` class, which uses this metaclass, and its `_check_ordering` method, which checks and validates the ordering configuration of the model.\n\n3. The `Options` class within `django.db.models.options`, which manages metadata for Django models and prepares this metadata for use by models. The `_prepare` method in particular ensures that model fields such as ordering are correctly set up.\n\nAll the provided code snippets are crucial because they cover how model class creation handles inheritance of metadata, checking of ordering attributes, and the setting up of model options. The identified spans need to be reviewed to understand how inheritance of ordering from a parent model to a child model behaves during query execution.",
