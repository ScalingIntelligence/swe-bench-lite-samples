Specifically, the Parent model has its Meta ordering set to ['-pk'], but when a Child model inherits from Parent, the ordering in the SQL query is ASC instead of the expected DESC. This discrepancy suggests a problem in how Django handles Meta ordering in inherited models. The relevant files identified so far include various Django core files related to model management, query compilation, and expression handling. The next step is to search for the exact code that processes Meta ordering in models, particularly where inheritance is considered.",

This can be caused by several reasons, including how Django handles inheritance and how the query is constructed. The search results presented include several key sections of Django's model and query handling code, which are likely relevant to this issue. Specifically, I will analyze the following parts:1. 'Model._check_ordering' which checks the validity of the ordering options.2. 'Query.add_ordering' which adds ordering to the query.3. 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' which constructs the ORDER BY clause in the SQL query. I will focus on these parts to ensure the ordering is correctly processed and applied to the query.By examining these code spans, I can determine if there are any issues in how Django processes or applies the ordering specified in the Meta class of an inherited model.",
