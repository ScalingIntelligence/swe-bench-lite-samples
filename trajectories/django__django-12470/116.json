            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the ordering of queryset results in Django when using inherited models. Specifically, the Parent model has Meta.ordering set to ['-pk'], which should order by the primary key in descending order. However, when querying the Child model, the ordering is not being applied correctly, resulting in an ascending order instead of the expected descending order. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with how Django handles the Meta.ordering attribute in inherited models or with the SQL query generation for such cases. To diagnose and potentially resolve this issue, it's crucial to investigate the relevant parts of Django's codebase that deal with model inheritance, Meta options, and SQL query compilation. Key areas to look into include the handling of Meta options in model inheritance, the generation of SQL queries for inherited models, and specific methods or functions responsible for ordering in the Django ORM.",

However, the actual query generated orders by 'id' in ascending order. To address this, we need to identify code spans that handle model ordering, particularly where the Meta class is defined and how ordering is applied in the Query class. In the search results, relevant code spans can be found in 'django/db/models/options.py' handling the Meta class, and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' for query generation and ordering. Additionally, 'Options.__init__' initializes the ordering attribute, and 'Query.__init__' demonstrates how order_by gets initialized. 'Query.add_ordering' defines how ordering is added to the query. This thorough examination reveals that the code spans align with the reported issue, handling the Meta class definition and query ordering methods. Therefore, these files and their code spans are deemed relevant for addressing the issue related to model ordering in Django.",
