The reported issue suggests that the ordering specified in the Parent model's Meta class (\"ordering = ['-pk']\") is not being correctly applied to queries on the Child model. This indicates a potential problem in how Django's ORM handles inherited Meta attributes, particularly the 'ordering' attribute. The key spans to examine from the search results are those related to model initialization (span 'Model.__init__' in 'django/db/models/base.py'), option handling (span 'Options.__init__' in 'django/db/models/options.py'), and SQL query compilation (span 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py'). These spans are crucial as they deal with the actual implementation of how Django models are instantiated, how their options are processed, and how SQL queries are compiled, including the application of ordering.
