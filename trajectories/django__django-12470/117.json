The issue arises when querying the 'Child' model, where the ordering should be descending but is instead ascending.\n\nThe search results reveal several key sections of code that are relevant to the issue, particularly in understanding how Django handles model inheritance and ordering. \n\nFirst, the 'ModelBase' class in 'django/db/models/base.py' is responsible for the meta class behavior of models, which includes ordering. The '__init__' method of 'Model' is also highlighted, indicating how model instances are initialized, which could be relevant if the ordering is set during initialization.\n\nNext, the 'Options' class in 'django/db/models/options.py' is crucial as it deals with model options such as 'ordering'. The '__init__' method initializes the 'ordering' attribute, and the '_populate_directed_relation_graph' method might provide insights into how relations are handled across models, including inherited models like 'Child' and 'Parent'.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', the 'Query' class and its 'add_ordering' method are relevant for understanding how ordering is added to queries. Additionally, 'join_parent_model' could influence how the parent model's ordering is considered during joins with child models.\n\nFinally, in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'SQLCompiler' class and specifically the 'get_order_by' method are central to how SQL ordering is compiled and executed. This method processes ordering from various sources, including model Meta options, and determines the final SQL ordering.\n\nSelecting the specific 'Options.__init__', 'Options._populate_directed_relation_graph', 'Query.add_ordering', and 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' spans can help address the issue's core functionality.\n\nThese selected code spans should provide a comprehensive look at how model inheritance and ordering are handled in Django, which should be sufficient to identify and potentially fix the ordering issue with the 'Child' model.",

This issue could be related to how the Meta class options are inherited and applied during query compilation.
