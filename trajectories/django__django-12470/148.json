When querying the Child model, the ordering is incorrect, showing ASC instead of expected DESC. There are several key areas in the search results that are relevant to this issue.\n\nFirst, in 'django/db/models/query.py', the 'QuerySet.order_by' method is crucial since it defines how ordering is applied to a queryset. The 'add_ordering' method within 'Query' in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' also plays a key role in how ordering is processed. \n\nSecond, 'django/db/models/base.py' contains the 'Model' class and its '_check_ordering' method, which checks for ordering-related issues. This is relevant as it checks for conflicts and invalid ordering fields, which could be related to the issue's reported improper ordering.\n\nFinally, 'django/contrib/admin/options.py' and 'django/contrib/admin/views/main.py' are relevant because they deal with ordering in the context of admin views, though direct relevance to the model inheritance issue might be less pronounced compared to the earlier two.\n\nThe central issue seems to be around how Django handles ordering when models inherit Meta from a parent, specifically looking at how 'ordering' is interpreted and applied, potentially missing or incorrectly applying it from the base class to the derived class. It appears that the 'ordering' attribute from the Parent's Meta might not be properly respected when querying the Child model.",
