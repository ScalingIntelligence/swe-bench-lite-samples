Specifically, the Parent model specifies ordering by '-pk', which should be inherited by the Child model. The expected behavior on querying Child models is to have results ordered by '-pk' (descending), but instead, the order is 'ASC' (ascending due to missing inheritance logic or mishandling of ordering in inherited models). The relevant files to investigate would be those handling model inheritance, model options (like Meta ordering), and the SQL compilation where ordering is applied. I will search for specific functions and properties related to ordering and inheritance to pinpoint the problem.",

This results in the child model's queries being ordered in ASC instead of the expected DESC. To investigate this issue, it's crucial to look into how Django handles Meta class inheritance and the processing of the 'ordering' attribute. In the provided search results, several key parts of the Django model Options class are highlighted. The '__init__' span shows the initialization of the 'ordering' attribute, which defaults to an empty list. The 'get_base_chain' and 'get_parent_list' methods are relevant as they deal with the hierarchy of model inheritance. These methods could potentially affect how the 'ordering' attribute is inherited from parent to child models. Additionally, the '_populate_directed_relation_graph' method, while primarily focused on setting up relations between models, might indirectly influence how ordering is applied, especially in complex inheritance scenarios. However, the current search results do not directly include the code responsible for applying the ordering from the Meta class to the database queries. A deeper investigation into the database query generation and the handling of the 'ordering' attribute during query construction is necessary.",

However, while this provides insight into how meta options might be inherited in general, the specific issue regarding the ordering by '-pk' in inherited models is not explicitly addressed in the provided code snippet. It is reasonable to assume that the logic for properly inheriting the '-pk' ordering from the Parent model to the Child model should be present here, but without seeing additional methods or complete setup, it's hard to confirm.

The analysis of the reported issue reveals that the problem lies in how Django handles ordering in the presence of inheritance. Specifically, the `Child` class, which inherits from `Parent`, should order by 'Parent.pk' in descending order when queried, but it orders in ascending order. The provided file context and search results reveal key sections of Django's ORM codebase that manage model metadata (`Options` class) and SQL query generation. The `Options` class includes methods `__init__`, `get_base_chain`, `get_parent_list`, `get_fields`, and `_populate_directed_relation_graph`, which hint at the mechanisms managing model inheritance and metadata. The search results include the `Query` class, which constructs SQL queries, and the `SQLCompiler` class, which compiles these queries into SQL. In both, we see elements related to query initialization and ordering, specifically the `add_ordering` method in the `Query` class and the `get_order_by` method in the `SQLCompiler` class. These methods handle how ordering information is integrated into the SQL query and provide clues as to why the ordering directive from the `Parent` model might not be correctly applied to the `Child` model. The identified code spans, specifically those related to the initialization of the query and the integration of ordering instructions, are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",
