Specifically, the issue is that when querying the Child class, the order is ascending (ASC) instead of the expected descending (DESC) specified by '-pk' in Parent.Meta.ordering.\n\n2. From the provided search results, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with model initialization, Meta class handling, and query ordering in Django's ORM.\n\n3. The spans 'Model.__init__' and 'QuerySet.__init__' in django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/query.py respectively provide context on how models and querysets are initialized. However, they do not directly address the ordering issue.\n\n4. The span 'Query.__init__' in django/db/models/sql/query.py is more relevant as it deals with the SQL query construction, which includes the order_by attribute that might be affected by the Meta.ordering.\n\n5. The span 'Query.add_ordering' also in django/db/models/sql/query.py is crucial as it directly handles the addition of ordering to the query, which is where the actual ordering logic could be affected by the Meta.ordering setting.\n\n6. The span 'Query.join_parent_model' might also be relevant as it deals with joining parent models, which could potentially impact how the ordering from parent models is inherited or applied.\n\n7. Overall, the identified spans provide insight into where the issue of not inheriting the Parent's Meta.ordering could originate. The 'Query.add_ordering' span is particularly critical as it directly involves the processing of ordering arguments.",

The expected behavior is that querying the Child model should order results by '-pk' descending, but the actual behavior is ordering by 'pk' ascending. This discrepancy indicates a potential issue in how Django handles ordering in inherited models. \n\nThe search results include relevant sections of Django's source code that handle model inheritance, ordering, and querying. Notably, the 'Query' class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' contains methods for managing query ordering ('add_ordering') and joining parent models ('join_parent_model'). Additionally, the 'Options' class in 'django/db/models/options.py' manages model metadata, including ordering attributes. \n\nTo resolve the issue, it's important to trace how the ordering from the Parent model is applied to the Child model during query construction. The 'QuerySet' class in 'django/db/models/query.py' is also relevant, as it involves methods for ordering ('order_by'). The identified code spans provide a foundation to investigate and potentially modify how Django handles ordering in inherited models.",
