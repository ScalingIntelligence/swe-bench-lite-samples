The Meta class is defined in the options.py file and contains the ordering attribute which should ideally be ['-pk']. The QuerySet class from query.py is responsible for executing the database queries and its order_by method specifies how the results should be ordered. The ordered method further checks if there is any ordering implied, but the real problem lies in the fact that the Child class, which inherits from Parent, doesn't seem to carry over the Meta information properly leading to the issue of ordering not being respected upon querying. The QuerySet's order_by, reverse, and other methods might not be triggered if the model's Meta class isn't correctly inheriting the ordering attribute. There might also be some issues during the _populate_directed_relation_graph method which possibly influences how the ordering from ancestor classes is handled. The references here could influence the fix of ensuring that the ordering attribute from Parent.Meta is properly recognized and implemented in the Child class.",
