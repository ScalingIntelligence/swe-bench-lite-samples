            "scratch_pad": "The issue seems to be related to how Django handles ordering in models where inheritance is involved. Specifically, the Parent class has its ordering set to '-pk', but when querying the Child class, the ordering defaults to 'ASC'. This indicates a potential problem in how Django processes model inheritance and Meta class attributes like ordering. It's likely that the problem lies within Django's model handling or query compilation logic. Several files and classes are speculated to be related to this behavior: ModelBase, Model, ChangeList, Query, QuerySet, SQLCompiler, OrderBy, Options, and Field are among the significant suspects. The search should focus on these files and classes to identify where the ordering is parsed, transferred, or overridden in the context of model inheritance.",

Specifically, the Child model inherits from the Parent model, which has Meta ordering set to ['-pk']. However, when querying the Child model, the ordering is not descending as expected but ascending. This issue likely involves how Django handles ordering in inherited models. The provided search results include code spans from Django's model and query handling, which might be relevant to understanding or resolving this issue. These include the definition of the Model class and its Meta options handling in 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/options.py', as well as query and ordering methods in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py'. It's crucial to review these parts of the code to understand how the ordering is determined and applied in the context of inherited models. For instance, methods like 'add_ordering' and 'get_order_by' in the query classes handle the actual application of ordering, and understanding how they interact with model Meta options could reveal if there's a discrepancy or bug in applying inherited ordering.",

These classes and files are directly involved in model definition, query construction, and SQL compilation. Specifically, the Options class manages meta-options like ordering, which is crucial for the reported issue of inheriting the ordering attribute. Additionally, the Query class covers aspects related to join operations and ordering, which are fundamental for the inheritance of such settings. The SQLCompiler class also plays a key role in interpreting the model's ordering settings into SQL queries. Thus, the provided file context seems to cover all necessary areas related to the issue, including where the potential fix or adjustment might occur.",
