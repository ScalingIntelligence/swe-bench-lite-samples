Specifically, the Parent model defines ordering by '-pk', but this ordering is not respected when querying the Child model. The problem lies in how Django handles the inheritance and application of Meta.ordering across parent and child models. The relevant files to investigate would be related to model inheritance, Meta options handling, and SQL query generation. Given the context, focusing on files like 'base.py', 'query.py', 'sql/compiler.py', and 'options.py' should be sufficient to identify and rectify the issue.",

Specifically, the Parent model's Meta class has an ordering defined as ['-pk'], which is expected to order the Child model's records in descending order by primary key (pk). However, the actual query results in ordering in ascending order. The search results include several relevant spans across multiple files that are likely involved in handling the ordering mechanism in Django models.\n\n1. In 'django/db/models/options.py', spans related to 'Options' and its methods like '__init__', '_prepare', 'get_base_chain', and 'get_parent_list' are relevant because these methods handle the Meta options of a model, including ordering.\n\n2. In 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', the 'Query' class and its methods '__init__', 'join_parent_model', and 'add_ordering' are relevant. These methods handle the construction of SQL queries, including how joins and ordering are managed.\n\n3. In 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'SQLCompiler' class and its method 'get_order_by' are relevant because this method determines the actual SQL ordering based on the model's Meta ordering.\n\nThese spans indicate that the issue likely involves a misconfiguration or misunderstanding in how Django handles the Meta ordering attribute in inherited models through its query construction and compilation process. More specifically, the '_prepare' method in 'Options' might not be properly handling the inherited ordering, or the 'join_parent_model' method in 'Query' might be incorrectly interpreting the ordering directive when constructing the SQL query. The 'get_order_by' method in 'SQLCompiler' could also be a factor, as it finalizes the SQL ordering instructions.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the identified spans are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the reported issue.",
