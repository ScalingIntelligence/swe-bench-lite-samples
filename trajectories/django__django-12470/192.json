It looks like the logic that needs to be addressed is how the `self._meta_ordering` is handled within the `get_order_by` method in `SQLCompiler`. Checking where the `self._meta_ordering` is set and ensuring that it respects the inheritance ordering by inspecting the parent model ordering in the derived model might resolve the problem. This will require modifying the `django.db.models.sql.compiler.SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method by considering the parent model's ordering when defining the derived model's ordering.",
