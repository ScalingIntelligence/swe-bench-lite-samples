            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the expectation that the ordering specified in the Meta class of the Parent model should be inherited by the Child model. The actual behavior, however, does not reflect this expectation. The search should focus on understanding how Django models handle ordering inheritance. The relevant files and code spans seem to be centered around model definitions, query handling, and order management. Specifically, files like `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/db/models/options.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py` might contain critical functionality in handling ordering inheritance. The method `_check_ordering` in ModelBase, the Options class methods like `_prepare` and `get_parent_list`, and the QuerySet method `order_by` are all potential areas to investigate for understanding this issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the ordering behavior in a Django model inheritance scenario. Specifically, when a `Parent` model has `Meta.ordering = ['-pk']`, and a `Child` model inherits from `Parent`, querying the `Child` model should respect the `-pk` ordering specified in the `Parent`. However, the actual query ordering is ASC instead of DESC. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that handle model inheritance, ordering setting, and query generation.\n\nAfter analyzing the search results, I have found several spans of code that are relevant to the issue:\n\n1. `django/db/models/base.py` - This file contains the `ModelBase` class which is responsible for creating and initializing Django models. The `ModelBase.__new__` method handles the inheritance logic, including how the `Meta.ordering` attribute is inherited by child models.\n\n2. `django/db/models/options.py` - This file contains the `Options` class which handles metadata for Django models, including the `ordering` attribute. The `Options.setup_proxy` method and other methods in this class are relevant for understanding how ordering is set.\n\n3. `django/db/models/sql/query.py` - This file contains the `Query` class which is responsible for constructing SQL queries. The `Query.add_ordering` method is directly involved in how ordering is added to the SQL query.\n\n4. `django/db/models/query.py` - This file contains the `QuerySet` class which provides the Django QuerySet API. The `QuerySet.order_by` method is the public API for specifying ordering.\n\nThese spans of code collectively provide insight into how model inheritance, ordering settings, and query generation work in Django, and are therefore relevant to the reported issue.",
