This suggests a problem in how Django handles the inheritance of Meta options, particularly the ordering attribute. The most relevant files that might contain the solution are those dealing with model definition, querying, and ordering. Given the model definitions and the specific issue with '-pk' ordering not applying correctly, the focus should be on django/db/models/base.py, django/db/models/sql/query.py, and django/db/models/query.py. These files handle the core operations of model creation, querying, and SQL query generation, respectively, which include how ordering is applied. Additionally, the options.py file in the same models directory could also be relevant as it might manage the Meta options inheritance.",

Given this, I need to find the relevant code spans that handle model inheritance, Meta options, and query ordering. I will analyze the search results to identify these code spans.\n\n1. From `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model` class and its methods are relevant as it handles the base functionality of Django models, including inheritance. Specifically, the `_get_next_or_previous_in_order` method is interesting as it deals with ordering.\n2. `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is another key file to check as it handles SQL query construction, where ordering is crucial. The `Query` class and its methods like `add_ordering`, `setup_joins`, and `join_parent_model` are relevant.\n3. `django/db/models/query.py` contains the `QuerySet` class, which is used for querying the database. Methods like `order_by`, `_earliest`, `first`, and `last` are relevant as they deal with ordering results.\n4. `django/db/models/options.py` contains the `Options` class, which manages Meta options for models. Methods like `get_base_chain`, `get_parent_list`, and `get_ancestor_link` are relevant for understanding how inheritance works in Django models.\n\nBy analyzing these parts of the code, I can identify the relevant code spans that address the issue of inheriting Meta options such as ordering.",
