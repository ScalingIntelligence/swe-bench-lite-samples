Specifically, the Parent model's Meta ordering is set to ['-pk'], which should order by primary key in descending order. However, when the Child model inherits from Parent, querying the Child class shows the ordering is ASC instead of the expected DESC. This discrepancy suggests a need to investigate how Django handles Meta class ordering in inherited models and how queries are compiled. Focus should be on the Django source files related to model inheritance, query compilation, and Meta class handling.",

The provided search results include several key components from Django's ORM that are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing this issue. The main areas of focus are: 1. The Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py, which initializes the query object and handles the addition of ordering. 2. The SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, which compiles the SQL query and handles the ordering. 3. The QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py, which represents the collection of objects from the database and allows for ordering. 4. The Options class in django/db/models/options.py, which handles the Meta options for the models, including ordering. Relevant code spans from these files include the initialization of the Query class, the method for adding ordering, the SQLCompiler's handling of ordering, and the QuerySet's order_by method. Additionally, the Options class's handling of the ordering attribute is crucial. These code spans need to be carefully examined to understand how the '-pk' ordering is being processed and why it might not be resulting in a descending order as expected.",

Specifically, the files `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `django/db/models/query.py`, and `django/db/models/options.py` contain classes and methods that handle query construction, SQL compilation, and model metadata such as ordering. The code snippets provided show how the Query class manages ordering, how SQLCompiler processes order_by clauses, and how Options class in models handles Meta class attributes like ordering. This context seems sufficient to understand the mechanisms behind the issue - specifically how ordering is handled during query compilation and how Meta.ordering is inherited or overridden by child models. Further investigation might involve specific interplay between these components during model inheritance, but the provided context reveals the core functionalities involved. However, detailed interactions between these components during the inheritance process may not be fully covered.",

The primary focus should be on understanding how the `Query`, `SQLCompiler`, and `Options` classes interact during the compilation and execution of queries involving inherited models. The `Query` class handles the addition of ordering to the query object, while the `SQLCompiler` class resolves the ordering expressions into SQL. The `Options` class deals with the meta attributes of the models, including the `ordering` attribute. The provided file context gives insight into these interactions, particularly looking at the `add_ordering` method in `Query` and the `get_order_by` method in `SQLCompiler`. Both methods handle the resolution and addition of ordering expressions to the query. Additionally, the `Options` class's `contribute_to_class` method is crucial as it processes the Meta class attributes for a model, which includes the `ordering` attribute. This analysis should help in diagnosing why the ordering specified in the Parent model's Meta class might not be applying correctly to the Child model.",

The expected behavior is for the Child model to be ordered by '-pk' (descending ID), but the actual order by 'pk' (ascending ID). The search results and the file context provided contain several relevant code spans that relate to how Django handles model inheritance and ordering. Key areas of focus include: \n1. The Query class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and specifically the 'add_ordering' method where the ordering specified in Meta is added to the query. \n2. The SQLCompiler class in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' particularly the 'get_order_by' method responsible for compiling the ordering into SQL. \n3. The Options class in 'django/db/models/options.py' and its 'contribute_to_class' method where Meta options are processed and applied to the model. \n4.
