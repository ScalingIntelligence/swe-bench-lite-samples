The expected behavior is for the ordering to be in descending order (DESC) when querying the Child model, but the current behavior orders in ascending order (ASC). This discrepancy needs to be investigated in the Django codebase.\n\nThe search results provided several key sections of the Django codebase that are relevant to model inheritance and ordering. The 'Options' class in 'django/db/models/options.py' contains methods that handle model preparation and manager setup, which are critical for understanding how ordering is applied. The 'ModelBase' class in 'django/db/models/base.py' is responsible for creating model classes and preparing them, including handling ordering related to 'order_with_respect_to'. Additionally, the 'Query' and 'SQLCompiler' classes in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', respectively, deal with SQL query generation, which is where the actual ordering of the query results is determined.\n\nSpecifically, the '_prepare' method in the 'Options' and 'ModelBase' classes, along with the 'add_ordering' method in the 'Query' class, are of particular interest. These methods can influence how the '-pk' ordering is interpreted and applied to the SQL query. The current context does not identify any relevant files, so these methods are the starting point for further investigation to determine why the ordering is not being applied correctly in the Child model.",

The `_prepare` method in `django/db/models/base.py` influences how the model class is prepared, including the ordering. The `join_parent_model` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is crucial as it relates to joining parent models in SQL queries, which could potentially affect how inherited ordering is applied. Finally, `get_order_by` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` is the method that actually translates the ordering into SQL, and it uses the `order_by` and `extra_order_by` attributes of the query object.
