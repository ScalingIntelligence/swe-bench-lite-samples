When the 'Parent' model has an ordering specified in its Meta class (ordering = ['-pk']), the expectation is that the 'Child' model, which inherits from 'Parent', should also order by '-pk'. However, the actual query produced orders by 'pk' in ascending order, which is not the expected behavior. To address this issue, it is necessary to identify code spans within the Django codebase that might control or influence the ordering behavior in model inheritance scenarios. The search results provided include Django's model and query classes. Particularly relevant sections are found in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', 'django/db/models/base.py', and 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py'. These sections contain code related to query construction, model preparation, and SQL compilation, including methods like 'add_ordering', 'get_order_by', and model meta class handling. These methods are critical for understanding how ordering specifications are processed and applied, and are thus highly relevant to the reported issue.",

The key steps involve understanding how the Meta class's ordering attribute influences the SQL query generation and specifically how the '-pk' ordering directive is interpreted. From the provided code spans, we already have insightful spans from django/db/models/sql/query.py (Query class, Query.add_ordering, Query.clear_ordering) and django/db/models/sql/compiler.py (SQLCompiler.get_order_by, SQLCompiler.find_ordering_name). These spans provide a foundational understanding of how ordering is managed within Django's ORM. The new search results from django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/sql/compiler.py offer additional context: django/db/models/base.py (ModelBase.__new__, ModelBase._prepare) touches on how model classes are initialized and how Meta options are processed. In django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, the new spans (SQLCompiler.setup_query, SQLCompiler.pre_sql_setup, SQLCompiler.get_select, SQLCompiler.get_distinct) are contextual, showing how the query setup and selection processes are managed, which influences how ordering directives are ultimately applied in the SQL. The analysis shows that the issue of ordering may stem from how Meta ordering settings propagate through these layers and how joins and table mappings are handled, potentially influencing the order of primary keys in the SQL output. Identifying the exact points where the 'ordering' Meta directive is interpreted or possibly misinterpreted will guide further solutions to the problem, which might involve refining how Meta class settings are passed down the class hierarchy in Model inheritance or adjusting how ordering parameters are compiled in SQL generation.",

The `ModelBase` class handles model preparation and inheritance. Specifically, the `_prepare` method sets up the model, and the handling of 'Meta' class options, including `ordering`, is noted. The `SQLCompiler` class, particularly the `get_order_by` method, ensures that ordering expressions are correctly translated into SQL, respecting the `default_ordering` from the model's meta options if no explicit order is given. The file context provided includes relevant sections, but lacks some key details. Specifically, it doesn't show the complete handling of 'Meta' class when inherited, particularly how 'ordering' might be affected during `_prepare`.
