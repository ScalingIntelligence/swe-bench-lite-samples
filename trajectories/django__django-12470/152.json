This problem is likely to be located within the model inheritance logic in Django's ORM. Here, the Parent model specifies ordering by '-pk' in its Meta class, but when the Child class inherits from Parent and objects are queried, the ordering defaults to ASC instead of DESC as expected. This discrepancy suggests an issue in the Django ORM's handling of Meta class options, particularly in respect to ordering in model inheritance scenarios. The search should focus on files related to model inheritance, querying, and specifically, the handling of ordering options within the Meta class. The files already provided in the context highlight several key areas such as django/db/models/base.py, which is central to model definitions and inheritance, and django/db/models/sql/query.py, which deals with SQL query generation. These areas should be investigated further for code related to inheritance and ordering operations.",

This issue suggests that the ordering specified in the Parent's Meta class is not appropriately inherited by the Child model, leading to undesired ordering in queries.\n\nOn analyzing the search results, the relevant files identified for understanding and potentially addressing this issue are: 'django/db/models/options.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'.\n1. The 'django/db/models/options.py' file contains the 'Options' class which manages meta options for models, including the 'ordering' setting. Within this class, the '_prepare' method is particularly relevant as it seems to handle the Meta class preparation and initial settings for the ordering attribute.\n2. The 'django/db/models/base.py' file contains the foundational logic for model classes in Django, such as the 'ModelBase' metaclass and the 'Model' class itself. The 'ModelBase.__new__', 'ModelBase.add_to_class', and 'ModelBase._prepare' methods are all critical for managing how subclasses and attributes are added to the model class, which includes handling of Meta class attributes.\n\nGiven the issue's nature, code spans that are particularly relevant include:\n- 'Options._prepare' which initializes Meta attributes.\n- 'ModelBase.__new__' and 'ModelBase._prepare', which collectively handle how model classes are constructed and setup.\nThese spans of code are key in understanding how ordering is set at the model level and may provide insights into why the ordering is not being correctly inherited from Parent to Child as expected. No other search results closely relate to this specific issue of inheriting and applying ordering meta settings from parent to child models.",
