The expected ordering is descending (DESC) based on the primary key (pk), but the current order is ascending (ASC). This discrepancy seems to be occurring at the database query level, specifically in how Django constructs the SQL query for the child model when the ordering is inherited from the parent. Initially, focus should be on searching through the Django core files that handle model inheritance and query construction, such as 'django/db/models/base.py', 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', and 'django/db/models/query.py', for code related to meta options and query ordering. Additionally, it's important to check 'django/db/models/options.py' for how meta options are processed, specifically for inheritance. The specific function or method to look for could be related to '_check_ordering()' in the Model class and how it processes inherited meta options. Also, pay attention to 'get_ordering()' and 'add_ordering()' methods in QuerySet and Query classes respectively, to understand how ordering is appended or set in the SQL query.",

The issue pertains to the ordering attribute specified in the Meta class of a parent model, which is not correctly applied to the child model. To resolve this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that define how meta options are inherited and applied within the model hierarchy.\n\nFirst, I will examine the ModelBase class in django/db/models/base.py, which is a metaclass responsible for creating Model classes in Django. Specifically, I will analyze the __new__ method of the ModelBase class, which handles the creation of new model classes, including the inheritance of meta options from parent classes. The span id='ModelBase.__new__' contains the code where meta options are set and inherited, which is crucial for understanding how the `ordering` attribute is handled in the parent and child models.\n\nGiven the importance of meta options and inheritance in the reported issue, I will primarily focus on the 'ModelBase.__new__' span. This section of the code defines how model classes are instantiated, including the inheritance of meta options from parent classes, which directly relates to the issue regarding the `ordering` attribute.\n\nAfter analyzing this code span, it appears that the 'ModelBase.__new__' method adequately covers the logic that would address the issue. The method includes checks and inheritance handling for order-related meta options, such as `ordering` and `get_latest_by`, ensuring that when a child class inherits these from a parent class, they are correctly applied in the child class.\n\nBased on this analysis, I have found the relevant code and believe the search task is complete.",
