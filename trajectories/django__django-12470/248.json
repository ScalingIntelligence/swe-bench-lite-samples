Specifically, when a Child model inherits from a Parent model, the ordering specified in the Parent.Meta.ordering should apply correctly to the Child model. However, the current implementation results in an ASC order instead of the expected DESC order when using '-pk'. The relevant parts of the codebase to address this issue are primarily located in the Django QuerySet and admin components. In the QuerySet, the order_by method is responsible for setting the ordering of the queryset. In the admin views, the ChangeList class handles the change list view of an object, including the ordering logic. The BaseModelAdmin class in the admin options contains methods related to ordering, such as get_ordering, which retrieves the default ordering for a ModelAdmin instance. Given these components, further investigation and potential adjustments to the ordering logic in both QuerySet and admin components are needed to resolve the inherited ordering issue.",
