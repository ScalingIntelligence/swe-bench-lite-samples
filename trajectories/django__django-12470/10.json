Specifically, when ordering by '-pk' is specified in Parent.Meta.ordering, the query generated for the Child model orders by 'id ASC' instead of 'id DESC'. \n\nThe relevant code spans to investigate are those related to the inheritance of Meta attributes and the handling of ordering in Django models. The 'ModelBase.__new__' span in 'django/db/models/base.py' appears to be a crucial part of the codebase related to model creation and the inheritance of Meta attributes. This span includes the logic for handling the Meta class, including the 'ordering' attribute. \n\nAdditionally, the 'QuerySet.order_by' span in 'django/db/models/query.py' is also relevant as it deals with the ordering of query results, which is the core of the reported issue. This span includes methods for adding ordering to a query, which will be useful to understand how the ordering attribute from the Meta class is applied to the query. \n\nIt appears that the primary issue might be how the 'ordering' attribute is being inherited and applied when creating queries for models that inherit from other models, particularly in this case where the 'ordering' attribute is specified negatively in the 'Parent' model. \n\nBased on the search results, the relevant code spans have been identified in 'django/db/models/base.py' (specifically 'ModelBase.__new__' and 'ModelBase.add_to_class') and 'django/db/models/query.py' ('QuerySet.order_by').

The provided file context includes the relevant code from Django's ModelBase class, which handles model creation and inheritance. This class contains logic that determines how the 'ordering' attribute from the Meta class is applied, specifically checking if the ordering attribute is set on the 'meta' and applying it accordingly. Additionally, the QuerySet class is provided, which includes the 'order_by' method that plays a crucial role in how ordering is applied to queries. These parts of the Django framework directly relate to the reported issue. Given the provided context, it appears that the relevant parts of the Django codebase for addressing this issue have been identified.",
