However, when querying the Child model (which inherits from Parent), the ordering is not applied correctly, resulting in ascending order instead of the expected descending order. This suggests a problem with how Django handles the inheritance and meta options of models. We should focus our search on files related to model inheritance, Meta class handling, and query ordering in Django.",

Specifically, the ordering specified in the Parent model's Meta class ('ordering = [\"-pk\"]') is not being correctly applied to the Child model, resulting in the query ordering ASC instead of DESC. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the inheritance of Meta attributes, particularly the 'ordering' attribute, in Django's model base class (ModelBase) and the model class (Model). From the search results, I've identified the relevant spans in the 'django/db/models/base.py' file that potentially handle this logic. The search results include parts of the ModelBase class where the new class is created (__new__ method) and where Meta class attributes are processed. I will focus on these spans to ensure the 'ordering' attribute is correctly inherited by the subclass.",

This directly addresses the issue reported as it deals with the handling of the `ordering` attribute in model inheritance. The code also shows how the `ordering` attribute is inherited from the parent class if it's not explicitly defined in the child class's Meta. Therefore, the relevant code for dealing with this issue in Django's model inheritance and Meta class handling is indeed present in the file context, suggesting that if there's a bug with the ordering attribute inheritance, this is where the fix would be implemented.",
