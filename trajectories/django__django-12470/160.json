The search results provided include relevant sections of the Django codebase that might be involved in the ordering process, including the 'QuerySet.order_by' method, the 'Query.add_ordering' method, and the 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' method. These sections are critical as they handle the application of ordering to query results and could potentially be the source of the issue. Additionally, the 'ModelBase.__new__' method is included as it is responsible for managing model metadata such as ordering, which is crucial for understanding how the Meta options are processed and applied to models. This initial analysis suggests that these sections of code are relevant to the reported issue, particularly focusing on how ordering is applied and inherited in model definitions.",

The Django code examined includes the ModelBase class, which handles the inheritance and creation of models. Specifically, within the ModelBase class, there is a section that deals with the inheritance of Meta attributes, including ordering, from parent models to child models. The code logic indicates that if an ordering attribute is not explicitly defined in the Meta of the child model, it should inherit the ordering from the non-abstract parent. This matches the expected behavior described in the issue. Additionally, the QuerySet class and SQLCompiler class are also checked to ensure they correctly handle the ordering. No discrepancies are found in handling the ordering or in query formation. The file context provided seems sufficient to understand the handling of model and query ordering in the Django framework.",
