Specifically, the Parent model has a Meta class with ordering set to ['-pk'], but when querying the Child class, the ordering is not correctly applied and remains ASC instead of expected DESC. This suggests a deep-seated issue in how Django handles ordering in inherited models or its interpretation of Meta class attributes during query construction. The search should focus on Django's model inheritance handling, Meta attribute processing, and query compilation. Given the nature of the issue, searching through files related to model inheritance, query compilation, and Meta class processing is warranted.",

Additional spans like `SQLCompiler.__init__` and `Query.join_parent_model` also provide context but are not as directly related to the ordering problem. \n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans should provide a sufficient understanding of how Django handles ordering in inherited models, facilitating the resolution of the reported issue.",

Specifically, when dealing with inherited models, the ordering direction (ASC or DESC) should be preserved as specified in the parent model's Meta class.\n\nThe instruction is about preserving the ordering direction from the parent model's Meta class when dealing with inherited models. This means ensuring that the direction specified in the parent model's Meta class is adhered to unless explicitly overridden. The relevant lines in the code are those that determine the ordering direction and apply it, particularly when dealing with inherited models. The lines that need modification are the ones that set the ordering direction based on the Meta class's ordering information.",
