Specifically, the Parent model has Meta ordering set to ['-pk'], but when querying the Child model (which inherits from Parent), the ordering is not correctly applied. The query produced orders by 'pk' in ASC (ascending) order instead of DESC (descending) as expected. The analysis of the code spans provided in the search results shows that several key areas are potentially relevant. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'Model.__init__' span appears to handle model initialization, which might be relevant to the inherited model's setup. In 'django/db/models/options.py', the 'Options.__init__' and '_populate_directed_relation_graph' spans manage the options and relations of models, potentially influencing how orderings are inherited. In 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', the 'Query.join_parent_model' and 'Query.add_ordering' spans might directly affect how queries involving parent-child relationships and ordering are constructed. In 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' span is critical as it translates ordering directives into SQL, which is where the reported issue could be surfacing. Each of these spans is a candidate for further investigation to determine where the bug affecting the ordering might be located.",
