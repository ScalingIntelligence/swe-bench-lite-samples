The expected outcome is for the ordering to be DESC, but it is observed to be ASC. This suggests a problem with how Django handles the inheritance of Meta attributes, particularly the 'ordering' attribute. The search should focus on Django's model inheritance implementation and how the 'ordering' attribute is processed and applied in derived classes.",

This suggests a problem in how the Django ORM handles inheritance and meta options propagation.\n\nFrom the search results, several key areas of Django's ORM codebase are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **ModelBase Class**\n   - **`ModelBase.__new__`**: This method is responsible for creating new model classes and could be where the meta options like 'ordering' are initially set or inherited.\n   - **`ModelBase._prepare`**: This method prepares the model class for use and it's where meta options are fully applied. It handles the `order_with_respect_to` option but does not explicitly show handling for inherited `ordering`.\n\n2. **Query Class**\n   - **`Query.join_parent_model`**: This method joins parent models which could affect how ordering is inherited and applied in the query.\n\n3. **SQLCompiler Class**\n   - **`SQLCompiler.get_order_by`**: This method determines the final ordering of the query results, considering all specified orderings. It's crucial for figuring out how the inherited ordering from the Parent model is incorporated.\n\n4. **QuerySet Class**\n   - **`QuerySet.order_by`**: While this method overrides ordering at the QuerySet level, checking its interaction with underlying Query objects can provide insight into how model-level ordering settings affect query execution.\n\nThese code spans are critical for understanding and potentially fixing the issue where inherited ordering from a parent model is not correctly applied to a subclass model in queries. The next steps would involve a detailed examination of how these methods interact and ensure that the meta options from the Parent model are correctly propagated and applied during the query compilation process.",
