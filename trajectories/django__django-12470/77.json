It's suspected that the meta ordering specified in the Parent model is not being correctly translated to the Child model. To address this, we need to look into how Django handles model inheritance and specifically how it processes the Meta class's ordering attribute. This could involve examining the methods responsible for joining parent models or processing ordering options within the QuerySet class. Given the relevance of the provided code snippets, focusing on the `add_ordering` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `order_by` method in `django/db/models/query.py` seems appropriate. Additionally, investigating how `Meta.ordering` propagates in the model inheritance structure can provide insights into the root cause of this problem.",

When querying the child model, the result is ordered ASC instead of DESC as specified in the parent model's Meta class. The search results include relevant code spans from Django's Query and QuerySet classes. In 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', the 'Query' class is defined with methods like '__init__', 'add_ordering', and 'clear_ordering'. These methods are particularly relevant as they handle the initialization, addition, and clearing of ordering in a query. The 'add_ordering' method validates and adds ordering items to the query, which should ideally handle the '-pk' ordering specified in the parent model's Meta class. In 'django/db/models/query.py', the 'QuerySet' class includes methods such as '__init__', 'order_by', 'distinct', 'extra', and 'reverse'. The 'order_by' method allows the specification of ordering fields, and it interacts with the 'Query' class to achieve this. Given these findings, the relevant code spans are those that directly handle the ordering functionality, as they are key to understanding and potentially resolving the issue of incorrect ordering in inherited models.",
