Specifically, the Parent model has a Meta class with ordering set to ['-pk'], but when querying the Child model (which inherits from Parent), the ordering is not applied correctly. The SQL query generated for Child model queries shows the ordering as 'ASC' instead of the expected 'DESC'. This suggests a problem in how the inherited Meta.ordering is being processed or applied. The relevant files are likely those dealing with model inheritance, Meta class handling, and SQL query generation. Thus, I should focus on classes like ModelBase, Model, and methods related to ordering such as `add_ordering` in query.py, `get_order_by` in compiler.py, and `order_by` in query.py.",

This is highly relevant as it directly affects how ORDER BY clauses are managed and added to SQL queries.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'SQLCompiler' class and its 'get_order_by' method determine the final ORDER BY clause for SQL statements. This is critical for understanding how Django ORM translates model Meta ordering into SQL.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/query.py', the 'QuerySet' class and its 'order_by' method allow manual ordering of query results, which could be used to override or supplement default ordering from the model Meta class.\n\nThese search results collectively address the reported issue by providing insight into how Django handles model inheritance, query construction, and the implementation of ordering in SQL statements.",
