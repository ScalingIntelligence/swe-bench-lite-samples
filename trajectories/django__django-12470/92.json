            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the ordering of results when using an inherited model in Django. The specific problem is that specifying '-pk' in the Meta.ordering of the parent model does not result in descending order when queried through the child model. The provided code spans from django/db/models/base.py, django/db/models/sql/query.py, and django/db/models/sql/compiler.py seem relevant to understanding how model initialization and query construction handle ordering. \n\n1. In django/db/models/base.py, the Model initialization (__init__) is analyzed to understand how model instances are created and how the Meta class might be handled during this process. \n\n2. In django/db/models/sql/query.py, the Query class and its methods, like join_parent_model and add_ordering, are relevant. The join_parent_model function appears to handle how joins are set up for related models, which could affect how ordering is applied. The add_ordering function is directly responsible for handling ordering in a query. \n\n3. In django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, the SQLCompiler class and its get_order_by method are crucial. This method constructs the ORDER BY clause of the SQL query, which is where the ordering logic is applied. Understanding how the Meta ordering is incorporated into this process is key to solving the issue. \n\nGiven these analyses, it appears that the relevant code spans include the essential parts of Django's ORM that handle model initialization, query construction, and SQL compilation, which are all directly related to the issue of ordering with inherited models. Therefore, the task of identifying relevant code spans is complete with the provided spans.",
