The Parent model has a Meta class specifying ordering by '-pk', which is expected to order the Child model instances by their primary key in descending order. However, the actual query produced orders by 'id' in ascending order. To address this, we need to examine the relevant sections of Django's codebase that handle model inheritance and query ordering.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided code spans, several sections seem pertinent:\n1. The `Model.__init__` span in `django/db/models/base.py` involves the initialization of a model instance, which might be relevant for understanding how model states are set up.\n2. The `Options.__init__`, `Options._populate_directed_relation_graph`, and `Options.get_fields` spans in `django/db/models/options.py` are crucial for understanding how model options and relations are managed, including the ordering.\n3. The `Query.join_parent_model` and `Query.add_ordering` spans in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` are central to how queries are constructed, including joining parent models and applying ordering.\n4. The `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` span in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` is responsible for compiling the ordering part of the SQL query.\n\nThese spans collectively cover the areas where the issue of inherited ordering might be addressed. Further examination of these sections will help in determining the exact location of the bug or misconfiguration leading to the incorrect ordering in the Child model.",
