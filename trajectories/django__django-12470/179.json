The Parent model has Meta ordering set to ['-pk'], but when querying the Child model, the ordering defaults to ASC instead of DESC. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the QuerySet handles ordering, especially when dealing with inherited models. The provided search results contain the QuerySet class from django.db.models.query.py, which is a key component in Django's ORM responsible for handling queries. Specifically, the order_by method of the QuerySet class is relevant as it defines how ordering is applied to the query. However, the analysis needs to ensure that the order_by method or other related methods correctly handle the Meta ordering from inherited models. Given the limited context and the nature of the issue, it appears that the order_by method might not be correctly applying the inherited Meta ordering. Therefore, the relevant code spans in the search results are those related to the QuerySet class's initialization and the order_by method, as these are directly involved in processing queries and ordering.",

Specifically, when the Meta class of the Parent model specifies ordering by '-pk', the Child model should inherit this ordering and sort by '-pk' as well. However, the current query result orders by 'pk' instead of '-pk', indicating a discrepancy. The relevant parts of the code appear to be in the 'base.py' file where the ModelBase class handles class creation and attribute inheritance, and in 'options.py' where the Options class manages model options like ordering. Additionally, the 'query.py' file contains the QuerySet class which is responsible for executing database queries and managing ordering. It's important to review how ordering is inherited and applied, particularly in the '_prepare' method of ModelBase and the 'contribute_to_class' method of Options. The analysis should also consider how the QuerySet's order_by method interacts with these settings.",
