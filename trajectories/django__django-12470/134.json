The key elements to look for in the code are the handling of Meta.ordering in Model inheritance and how the order is applied to the child model. The search results contain several relevant code spans, especially in the ModelBase and Options classes within django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/options.py, respectively. These spans cover aspects like the creation of the model, adding attributes to the class, preparing the model meta options, and checking the model's ordering. Specifically, the _check_ordering method and the _prepare method in the Options class are of significant interest as they deal directly with the ordering settings for the models. Additionally, examining how the base manager and default manager handle the ordering, as indicated by the _base_manager and _default_manager properties in ModelBase, could also be crucial. Thus, the search task has provided relevant code spans that need further detailed analysis to fully understand and resolve the issue.",
