The issue specifically states that the ordering defined in the Parent model's Meta class does not apply to the Child model's queryset, leading to an incorrect ordering direction. The provided search results primarily involve Django's SQL query compilation and model query handling. The `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` appears to be the most relevant, as it handles the processing of ordering directions and the selection of fields. Additionally, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `QuerySet.order_by` method in `django/db/models/query.py` are relevant as they manage how query ordering is handled and applied. These sections of code represent critical parts of Django's ORM that translate model definitions into SQL queries, including how ordering is applied based on model Meta attributes and queryset methods. Thus, by examining these code spans, we can gain insights into how the ordering directive is being processed and potentially identify where it fails to properly apply the '-pk' ordering specified in the Parent model's Meta class.",
