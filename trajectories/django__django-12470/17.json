The expected ordering is descending based on the primary key ('-pk'), but the actual query generated orders by ascending. This suggests an issue in how Django handles the Meta ordering inheritance and the transformation of this ordering into SQL. The relevant files and methods to investigate include those dealing with model inheritance, Meta class handling, SQL query generation, and order handling. Specifically, the 'get_order_by' method in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'add_ordering' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', and the 'order_by' method in 'django/db/models/query.py' are potential candidates for locating the issue.",
