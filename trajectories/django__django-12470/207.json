            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves incorrect ordering in Django models when using inheritance. Specifically, the ordering defined in the Parent model's Meta class should affect the Child model's queries as well, but it is not applying the correct ordering. The query should be ordered DESC but is ordered ASC. The relevant files seem to be those handling model inheritance, meta options, query building, and ordering. Focusing on the file `django/db/models/base.py` which contains the `ModelBase` and `Model` classes, and `django/db/models/query.py` which contains the `QuerySet` class, is a good start. Additionally, `django/db/models/sql/query.py` which has the `Query` class handling SQL query generation, and `django/db/models/options.py` which contains the `Options` class handling model options like ordering, are likely relevant. The search should focus on the `order_by` method in `QuerySet`, the `ordering` handling in `Model` and `Options`, and the SQL query generation in `Query`.",

However, a direct link to the issue is not immediately clear from this section.\n\n2. In 'django/db/models/query.py', the 'QuerySet' class and its methods such as 'order_by' and 'reverse' are directly related to ordering.

In 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', the 'Query' class and its methods like 'add_ordering' and 'clear_ordering' are directly related to SQL query ordering.\n\n4. In 'django/db/models/options.py', the 'Options' class and its method '_prepare' deal with preparing the model for use, including setting up ordering. This could be crucial for understanding how ordering is set and inherited.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the focus should be on sections that deal with model and queryset ordering, specifically looking for how inheritance and overriding of ordering attributes are handled.
