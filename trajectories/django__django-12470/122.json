The provided search results, focusing on Django's model and query modules, contain several critical sections such as ModelBase._prepare, Model.__init__, and QuerySet.order_by, which are directly relevant to the issue. ModelBase._prepare appears to handle the preparation of model options, including ordering, which aligns with the need to ensure that the ordering specified in Meta is correctly applied across inherited models. Model.__init__ is related to initializing model instances and could potentially be involved in issues related to initializing models with ordering. QuerySet.order_by is specifically related to ordering query results, which directly addresses the issue of querying Child models and expecting the results to be ordered by '-pk', as specified in the Parent model's Meta. The other relevant sections in django/db/models/base.py provide utility methods related to ordering that support the primary process involved, which involves correctly organizing the SQL queries based on model metadata. The identified sections provide a solid foundation to investigate and potentially resolve the issue related to ordering in Django's inherited models.",
