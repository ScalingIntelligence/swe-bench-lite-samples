To do this, I will focus on examining the 'Meta' class in the 'options.py' file and the 'Model' class in the 'base.py' file, as well as the 'Query' class in the 'query.py' file, which likely intersects with the ordering logic during query execution. I will also consider the Django ORM's approach to honoring the 'ordering' attribute from parent models. Upon analysis, I find that the relevant code spans include the 'Options' class initialization in 'options.py', the '_populate_directed_relation_graph' method in 'Options', and the 'get_order_by' method in 'SQLCompiler' from 'compiler.py'. These sections are crucial as they encompass the process of defining the model options, including 'ordering', and executing queries with the specified ordering logic. The 'get_order_by' method, in particular, is essential for understanding how Django translates the 'ordering' attribute into actual SQL queries. This interconnectivity between the model definition and query execution is key to diagnosing and potentially rectifying the issue of inaccurate ordering in the case of inherited models.",
