The 'Child' class inherits from 'Parent', but the ordering attribute from 'Parent' does not carry over correctly. This suggests a potential issue in how Django handles the inheritance of the 'Meta' class attributes, specifically the 'ordering' attribute. The search results include relevant sections from Django's codebase that deal with model options and query sets. The 'Options' class in 'django/db/models/options.py' potentially holds the logic for managing 'Meta' class attributes, including 'ordering'. The '__init__' method of the 'Options' class initializes several attributes, including 'ordering', which implies this section might be where the issue arises. Additionally, the 'QuerySet' class in 'django/db/models/query.py' is responsible for querying the database, and understanding how the ordering is applied in this context could provide further insights. By focusing on these sections, we can pinpoint the exact location in the Django codebase that might need adjustment to correctly handle the inheritance of the 'ordering' attribute from the parent model to the child model.",

The `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` is the central place where meta options like `ordering` are configured. The methods `get_base_chain` and `get_parent_list` play crucial roles in managing these options for inheritance.\n\nThe `Options` class is responsible for holding all the metadata about a model, including its `ordering` attribute. During initialization, it sets default values and processes provided metadata. Notably, the `get_base_chain` method recursively builds a chain of parent models, which is essential for correctly applying meta options inherited from parent models. The `get_parent_list` method constructs a complete list of parent models, helping in tracking all relevant metadata across the inheritance hierarchy.\n\nAdditionally, the `query` construction in `django/db/models/query.py` shows how the `QuerySet` handles database queries, including the `resolve_expression` method that deals with expression resolution in the context of a `QuerySet`. This hints at where ordering might be set or altered in the query building process.\n\nGiven this context, it's crucial to similarly examine how these settings are applied or interpreted when building the final SQL query, perhaps focusing on the `add_ordering` method in the `Query` class or checking how the `ordering` attribute affects the `SQLCompiler`.\n\nNext steps would involve reviewing methods related to SQL query construction that could interact with or be influenced by `Options` meta settings, particularly those handling inherited models and their ordering properties.",

However, when querying the Child class, the expected DESC order is not achieved, instead resulting in ASC. To resolve this, it is crucial to examine how Django manages model inheritance and ordering.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, key components involved in handling these functionalities include Django's QuerySet and Options classes. The Options class is responsible for initializing the ordering attribute and contains methods critical for understanding inheritance such as fetching the base chain and list of parents. The Query class is equally significant as it constructs SQL queries, including the ordering segment.\n\nThe search results highlight the 'add_ordering' method in the Query class, which is essential for incorporating ordering into the query logic. The 'join_parent_model' method is pertinent as it manages the joining of parent models. Additionally, the 'get_base_chain' and 'get_parent_list' methods within the Options class are pivotal for understanding the inheritance hierarchy.\n\nIn light of the reported issue and the relevant code spans identified, the key spans should encompass those related to ordering and model inheritance within Django.",

Additionally, the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py handles the construction of SQL queries, including how ordering is managed through the add_ordering method. Given this context, it appears that all relevant aspects of managing and applying ordering in the context of model inheritance and query construction are covered.
