Specifically, the Child model is not respecting the Meta.ordering from the Parent model and is ordering in ASC instead of DESC. This suggests a potential discrepancy or bug in how Django handles model inheritance and ordering. The relevant files and methods to investigate are likely in the django/db/models directory, focusing on base.py, options.py, query.py, sql/compiler.py, and sql/query.py. Additionally, the ChangeList class in django/contrib/admin/views/main.py might also be relevant as it handles ordering in the admin interface. The key methods to look for are related to ordering, model inheritance, and SQL query generation.",

            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves the ordering of the Child class inheriting incorrectly from the Parent class. Specifically, the ordering in the Child class should reflect the ordering specified in Parent.Meta.ordering (['-pk']), but it currently orders by 'pk' in ascending order. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle model inheritance and ordering. The search results include several potential candidates:\n1. django/db/models/base.py: This file contains the Model class, which is the base for all Django models. Relevant spans include '_check_ordering' and '_get_next_or_previous_in_order', which might help in understanding how ordering is being handled and checked in Django models.\n2. django/contrib/admin/views/main.py: Contains 'ChangeList' class methods such as '_get_default_ordering', 'get_ordering_field', and 'get_ordering', which suggest that this part of the codebase deals with ordering logic, potentially related to admin views.\n3. django/db/models/sql/query.py: The 'Query' class has methods 'add_ordering' and 'clear_ordering', which manage the ordering of SQL queries. Understanding these might be essential, especially how inherited orderings could affect SQL construction.\n4. django/db/models/sql/compiler.py: The 'SQLCompiler' class has a method 'get_order_by', which constructs the ORDER BY clause. This is crucial for deciphering how order is assigned and prioritized.\n5. Checking the implementation of 'Child' model's query construction or Meta options resolution perhaps in contexts where autogenerated model/field code or manager code is checked (though not explicitly provided in the search results) could also find more clues.\nBy evaluating these code spans, the goal is to pinpoint specific sections and methods dealing with model ordering, particularly in the context of inheritance which can illuminate why the current ordering is incorrect as per the issue description.",
