The expected behavior is to order the Child model by '-pk' descending as specified in the Parent.Meta.ordering. The search should focus on the Django model inheritance and ordering mechanisms, likely involving methods related to ordering and model inheritance in the Django ORM. The potential locations for relevant code could be in the 'django/db/models/' directory, particularly focusing on 'base.py', 'query.py', 'sql/compiler.py', and 'options.py'",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the Django model inheritance and the ordering behavior when specifying 'ordering = [\"-pk\"]' in the Meta class of the Parent model. The expected behavior is that the query should order the results in DESCending order by the primary key ('pk'), but the actual query is ordering in ASCending order. This discrepancy needs to be investigated within the Django ORM codebase to understand how the Meta class ordering is processed and applied to the queries.\n\nIn the search results, several relevant files and spans of code have been identified:\n\n1. django/db/models/base.py - This file contains the Model class definition which is central to Django's ORM. The '_check_ordering' span within the Model class checks for potential issues with the model's ordering, which could be relevant to the issue.\n\n2. django/db/models/sql/query.py - This file contains the Query class which handles the construction of SQL queries. The 'add_ordering' and 'clear_ordering' spans deal with adding and clearing ordering from the query, respectively. This could be where the ordering specified in the Meta class is handled or overridden.\n\n3. django/db/models/options.py - This file contains the Options class, which deals with various metadata options for a model including ordering. The 'add_field' and 'managers' spans could be relevant as they deal with adding fields and managing fields, potentially affecting how ordering is applied.\n\n4. django/db/models/sql/compiler.py - This file contains the SQLCompiler class, which compiles SQL statements. The 'get_order_by' span is responsible for generating the ORDER BY clause of the SQL query, which is directly related to the ordering issue.\n\nTo further diagnose the issue, it would be helpful to look at how the Meta class option 'ordering' is processed through these different layers, and particularly, whether and where the ordering direction (ASC versus DESC) is being handled as expected.\n\nThe identified code spans provide a strong basis for investigating the cause of the ordering discrepancy. However, I will narrow down and provide the most relevant spans that directly pertain to the Meta class 'ordering' attribute and its application in query generation.",
