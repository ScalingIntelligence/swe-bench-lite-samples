The Parent model has a Meta class with ordering set to ['-pk'], but when querying the Child model (which inherits from Parent), the order is not descending as expected. The relevant part of the Django codebase to investigate includes the models handling inheritance and ordering. The `OrderableAggMixin`, `ChangeList`, `Query`, `QuerySet`, `SQLCompiler`, and `OrderBy` classes are potential areas to focus on due to their roles in ordering and querying. Specifically, focusing on the `add_ordering` method in the `Query` class and the `get_order_by` method in the `SQLCompiler` class seems crucial to understanding how ordering is applied and compiled into SQL.",
