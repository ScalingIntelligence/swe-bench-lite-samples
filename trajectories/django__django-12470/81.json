The expected behavior is to order by '-pk' in descending order for the Child model, but the actual query results in ascending order by 'id'. This discrepancy may be related to how Django handles ordering in the context of inherited models. Key areas to investigate include the `Model` class, `QuerySet`, `SQLCompiler`, and possibly `Options` to see how ordering is managed and applied. Additionally, the `model_unpickle` function could be relevant if it plays a role in the serialization or deserialization of models.",

Specifically, when ordering by '-pk' on the Parent model, the Child model queries are not reflecting this order, instead ordering by 'ASC' by default. To address this, I need to identify where the ordering is determined and how it is applied across parent-child relationships in Django's ORM. I will look for methods responsible for obtaining the base chain of parent models, retrieving parent lists, and setting up joins for ordering. Additionally, I will check how the ordering attribute from the Meta class is accessed and applied in query generation.\n\nLooking through the search results, several code spans appear relevant:\n\n1. In `django/db/models/options.py`, the `Options.get_base_chain` method identifies the base chain of parent models, which is crucial for understanding how inheritance affects ordering.\n\n2. Also in `django/db/models/options.py`, the `Options.get_parent_list` method generates a list of all parents to consider for inheritance of Meta options like ordering.\n\n3. The `Options.get_path_to_parent` and `Options.get_path_from_parent` methods in `django/db/models/options.py` are implicated in determining the path for joins between parents and children, which could affect the ordering when querying child models.\n\n4. In `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method handles the ordering of SQL queries. It seems to prioritize `query.order_by` over `query.get_meta().ordering`, which could explain why the parent model's ordering is not being applied correctly.\n\n5. Similarly, `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`'s `SQLCompiler.find_ordering_name` method searches for the ordering by name, including across joins, which is necessary when ordering by a field in a related parent model.\n\nOverall, these methods from the `Options` class and the `SQLCompiler` class seem to be central to how Django handles model inheritance and applies ordering. By focusing on the implementation of these methods, we can understand why the ordering is not correctly applying to the child model and identify potential fixes or patches for the issue.",
