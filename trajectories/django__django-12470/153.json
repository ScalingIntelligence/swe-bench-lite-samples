These files are relevant because they deal with model initialization, metadata options, query construction, and SQL compilation respectively. The spans 'ModelBase', 'Options.__init__', and 'Options.get_fields' in 'django/db/models/options.py' are particularly relevant as they relate to how model metadata is initialized and accessed, including the 'ordering' attribute. The span 'Query.add_ordering' in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is crucial for understanding how ordering is added to a query, indicating where the 'Meta.ordering' could potentially be overridden or misinterpreted. Finally, 'SQLCompiler.get_order_by' in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' is important for seeing how SQL order by clauses are generated, where the assembled ordering might be misconstrued due to model inheritance.
