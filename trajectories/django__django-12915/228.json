The traceback shows a `NoneType` object being non-callable, which typically indicates that a method or function that is expected to return a callable (a function or method) is instead returning `None`. This could be due to incomplete or missing implementations in the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` or related classes, particularly where asynchronous handling might not be properly defined or inherited. To address this, we need to ensure that `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` properly implements the missing async response handling. We should search for the class `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` and focus on finding or adding the missing `get_response_async` method.",
