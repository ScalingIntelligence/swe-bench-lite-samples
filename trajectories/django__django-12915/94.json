Upon analyzing the search results, I found relevant code spans in two files: 'django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py' and 'django/core/handlers/base.py'. In 'django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py', the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class extends ASGIHandler but does not override the 'get_response_async' method, which is key for handling async responses. In 'django/core/handlers/base.py', the BaseHandler class has the 'get_response_async' method that can be used as a reference for implementing the missing functionality in the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class.
