The traceback indicates that the error occurs at the point where the ASGI handler tries to call get_response_async, suggesting that this method might be missing or not properly initialized in the related classes. In the search results, the BaseHandler class from django/core/handlers/base.py contains a definition for get_response_async which seems relevant to the issue, as it's the method that raises an error in the traceback. This method is part of the _middleware_chain processing, which is where the exception is ultimately triggered.
