To address this, the search should focus on the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class and related files in the Django project. Specifically, the search should look for the `get_response` method within this class and its parent classes since it seems to be the missing point for the async implementation. Additionally, the code snippet provided in the traceback can be used to narrow the search down.",
