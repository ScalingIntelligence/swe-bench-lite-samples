This seems to be related to the static files handling middleware in Django. To address the issue, we need to find where the StaticFilesHandlerMixin and ASGIStaticFilesHandler are defined and check if the get_response_async method is missing or improperly defined. Given the provided context, it seems clear that the StaticFilesHandlerMixin does indeed miss the async response function, as evidenced by the error traceback. Therefore, we should focus on the staticfiles handler files and any related base handler files for potential fixes.",

In 'django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py', we have the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class, which extends StaticFilesHandlerMixin and ASGIHandler. However, this class does not define a method for getting the response asynchronously, which aligns with the reported issue. In 'django/core/handlers/base.py', the BaseHandler class defines an asynchronous method, get_response_async, which could potentially be related to resolving the reported issue by providing a template or a model for implementing the missing functionality in the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class. Therefore, the main focus should be to implement a similar async method in the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class, based on the existing patterns found in the BaseHandler class.",
