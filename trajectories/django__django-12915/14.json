This is evident from the traceback indicating a 'NoneType' object is not callable when trying to use the ASGIStaticFilesHandler. To address this, we need to identify where the async response function should be implemented or if it is already referenced but not properly implemented. From the search results, it appears that the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class inherits from `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` and `ASGIHandler`. The `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` class does not show an async response function in the provided snippet, which likely is the source of the issue. The `BaseHandler` class in `django/core/handlers/base.py` does have a `get_response_async` method, which might indicate where the implementation should extend into the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`. Therefore, the relevant code spans to focus on would be the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` declaration and its initialization (`__init__` method) to possibly add or update with the missing async functionality, as well as the `BaseHandler.get_response_async` method which serves as a template or reference for what the async response might look like.",
