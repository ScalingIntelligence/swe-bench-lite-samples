This points to a missing or improperly defined 'get_response_async' method in the ASGIStaticFilesHandler or its mixin. Reviewing the search results, the 'django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py' file contains the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class definition and its constructor (__init__). However, there is no 'get_response_async' method defined in the provided code spans. This suggests that the method might not be implemented yet or is defined elsewhere. The 'django/core/handlers/base.py' file, on the other hand, contains the BaseHandler class with a 'get_response_async' method, which could be relevant if the ASGIStaticFilesHandler is supposed to inherit or utilize this method. Considering these findings, it's clear that the 'get_response_async' method is necessary for the ASGIStaticFilesHandler to handle async responses, and it should be added or ensured in the context of this handler and its mixin.",
