This issue is particularly important for ensuring consistency with tools like flake8 and doctests, which expect precise formatting without trailing whitespaces. Analyzing the provided search results, it's evident that the trailing whitespace issue is likely occurring in the __repr__ method of the GroupBy class. The __repr__ method is responsible for generating a string representation of the GroupBy object, which is where the trailing whitespace issue originates. By identifying and addressing this method, the issue can be resolved effectively without affecting other parts of the codebase that are not related to text representation.\n\nGiven the context provided, it's clear that the __repr__ method of the GroupBy class is where the trailing whitespace is being added. This method constructs the string representation of a GroupBy object and includes a trailing space before the newline character. The immediate relevance of this code span to the reported issue is high, as fixing the trailing whitespace requires editing the string construction part within the __repr__ method to avoid adding the extra space. Other parts of the provided search results, such as instance definitions and method initializers, though essential to the GroupBy functionality, are not directly relevant to the reported issue of trailing whitespace in the text representation. Additionally, the importance of reviewing the entire section of code to ensure a comprehensive understanding before making a decision is highlighted, as understanding the broader context of how GroupBy objects are handled and represented across the codebase is crucial for making an informed decision.",

The first example in the documentation demonstrate this:\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n>>> import xarray as xr, numpy as np\r\n>>> ds = xr.Dataset(\r\n...     {\"foo\": ((\"x\", \"y\"), np.random.rand(4, 3))},\r\n...     coords={\"x\": [10, 20, 30, 40], \"letters\": (\"x\", list(\"abba\"))},\r\n... )\r\n>>> ds.groupby(\"letters\")\r\nDatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \r\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a trailing whitespace in the first line of output which is \"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \". This can be seen more clearly by converting the object to a string (note the whitespace before `\\n`):\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n>>> str(ds.groupby(\"letters\"))\r\n\"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't a problem in itself, it causes an issue for us because we use flake8 in continuous integration to verify that our code is correctly formatted and we also have doctests that rely on DatasetGroupBy textual representation. Flake8 reports a violation on the trailing whitespaces in our docstrings. If we remove the trailing whitespaces, our doctests fail because the expected output doesn't match the actual output. So we have conflicting constraints coming from our tools which both seem reasonable. Trailing whitespaces are forbidden by flake8 because, among other reasons, they lead to noisy git diffs. Doctest want the expected output to be exactly the same as the actual output and considers a trailing whitespace to be a significant difference. We could configure flake8 to ignore this particular violation for the files in which we have these doctests, but this may cause other trailing whitespaces to creep in our code, which we don't want. Unfortunately it's not possible to just add `# NoQA` comments to get flake8 to ignore the violation only for specific lines because that creates a difference between expected and actual output from doctest point of view. Flake8 doesn't allow to disable checks for blocks of code either.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason for having this trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy representation? Whould it be OK to remove it? If so please let me know and I can make a pull request.\n"
