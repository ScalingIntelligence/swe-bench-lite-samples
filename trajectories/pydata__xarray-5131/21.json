This issue directly affects the `pretty_print` function in the `xarray/core/formatting.py` file, specifically where it appends the whitespace. The `pretty_print` function adds extra spaces based on the difference between the truncated string length and the specified number of characters (`numchars`). This is precisely the source of the trailing whitespace. Upon reviewing the code, it's clear that the issue lies within this function. To address the reported issue, the trailing whitespace in the `pretty_print` function needs to be adjusted or potentially suppressed depending on the circumstance where this function is used. Given that the `pretty_print` function controls the whitespace format and is directly linked to the text representation of DatasetGroupBy objects, it should be the primary focus for addressing the trailing whitespace issue.",

The whitespace appears in the first line of the output, specifically in the string 'DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' ', as demonstrated in the provided example. This issue is problematic because it affects automated code formatting checks (like flake8) and doctests which rely on precise matching of the expected output.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans for addressing this issue are located in the GroupBy class within 'xarray/core/groupby.py'. The method `__repr__` of the GroupBy class is responsible for the string representation of the DatasetGroupBy object. It uses the function `format_array_flat` to format the labels of the groups, which could potentially introduce trailing whitespaces. Considering the context provided, the focus should be on ensuring that the string representation of the DatasetGroupBy does not include any unintended trailing whitespaces.\n\nLooking at the `__repr__` method, it constructs the string representation with a call to `format_array_flat` for the group labels. This method might be the source of the trailing whitespace issue, especially if it concatenates strings in a way that leads to trailing spaces. Additionally, examining the definition of `format_array_flat` or related string formatting functions in the 'xarray/core/groupby.py' file could provide more insights into whether and how trailing whitespaces are being introduced.\n\nSince the problem is localized in the `__repr__` method of the GroupBy class and involves string formatting for the group labels, addressing this issue would involve reviewing and potentially modifying this method to ensure no trailing whitespaces are appended to the string representation of the DatasetGroupBy.",

This can be seen more clearly by converting the object to a string (note the whitespace before `\\n`):\r\n\r\n```pycon\r\n>>> str(ds.groupby(\"letters\"))\r\n\"DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' \\n2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't a problem in itself, it causes an issue for us because we use flake8 in continuous integration to verify that our code is correctly formatted and we also have doctests that rely on DatasetGroupBy textual representation. Flake8 reports a violation on the trailing whitespaces in our docstrings. If we remove the trailing whitespaces, our doctests fail because the expected output doesn't match the actual output. So we have conflicting constraints coming from our tools which both seem reasonable. Trailing whitespaces are forbidden by flake8 because, among other reasons, they lead to noisy git diffs. Doctest want the expected output to be exactly the same as the actual output and considers a trailing whitespace to be a significant difference. We could configure flake8 to ignore this particular violation for the files in which we have these doctests, but this may cause other trailing whitespaces to creep in our code, which we don't want. Unfortunately it's not possible to just add `# NoQA` comments to get flake8 to ignore the violation only for specific lines because that creates a difference between expected and actual output from doctest point of view. Flake8 doesn't allow to disable checks for blocks of code either.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason for having this trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy representation? Whould it be OK to remove it? If so please let me know and I can make a pull request.\n"
