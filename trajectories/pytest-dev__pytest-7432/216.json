The code block inside this function that handles the `runxfail` option and skips seems to be where the problem could be manifesting, as it does not correctly update or report the location of the skip when the `--runxfail` flag is used. Additionally, the surrounding context in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` regarding skipped and xfailed test handling reinforces the relevance of this section of code to the reported issue. Thus, the identified span within `pytest_runtest_makereport` is a strong candidate for further investigation and bug fixing.",
