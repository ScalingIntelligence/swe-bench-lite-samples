The hint indicates that the bug is in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, specifically in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. Upon examining the provided code, the problematic behavior likely stems from the handling of the `--runxfail` option within this hook. The code section named 'pytest_runtest_makereport' is directly relevant as it contains the logic for handling test outcomes including skips and xfails. It's the place where the modification of test report information occurs, which could lead to the incorrect location reporting.",
