The hint suggests that the bug is in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook within `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Upon reviewing the provided search results, the relevant code span is indeed the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function. This function contains logic that processes test outcomes, including handling of skipped tests and `xfail` scenarios. The logic inside the function that checks for `item.config.option.runxfail` and subsequently processes xfail and skip conditions is where the issue might lie. Specifically, the handling of `rep.skipped` and `rep.longrepr` manipulation under the condition of `item.config.option.runxfail` being true could be causing the incorrect skip location reporting. Therefore, the identified span is relevant to the reported issue.",
