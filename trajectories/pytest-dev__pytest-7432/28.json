Analyzing the provided code, it's clear that the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function is responsible for generating test reports and handling skipped tests. The logic related to the `--runxfail` option is present in this function, particularly where it checks `if item.config.option.runxfail: pass`. This section doesn't seem to appropriately handle the skip location reporting when `--runxfail` is in use, leading to the reported issue.
