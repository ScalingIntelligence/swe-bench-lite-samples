The hint points directly to `pytest_runtest_makereport` in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The provided search results contain the relevant hook implementation. The function `pytest_runtest_makereport` is the main focus as it handles the reporting of test results, including the handling of skipped tests and xfail conditions. The code within this function needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure that the location reporting for skipped tests is accurately reflecting the test definition when `--runxfail` is used. The code spans involving the skip and xfail logic in `pytest_runtest_makereport` should be examined to understand how the `--runxfail` option might be affecting the reporting. Additionally, the `evaluate_skip_marks` and `evaluate_xfail_marks` functions are relevant as they evaluate the conditions for skipping and expecting failures, respectively. These functions set up the state that `pytest_runtest_makereport` uses to generate its reports. Overall, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the logic involved in handling skips and xfails during test execution and reporting, which aligns with the reported issue's focus.",
