The hint points to `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, particularly the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook as the source of the bug. Reviewing the code in this file, the most relevant sections are those dealing with the handling of skips and the integration with the `--runxfail` flag. Specifically, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function contains logic that might wrongly change the location of the skip when `--runxfail` is used. This function's logic decides the outcome of the test based on conditions including `item.config.option.runxfail`, which might incorrectly affect the skip location reporting. The code span id 'pytest_runtest_makereport' contains the problematic logic, making it directly relevant to the issue. No other spans appear to directly address the issue.",
