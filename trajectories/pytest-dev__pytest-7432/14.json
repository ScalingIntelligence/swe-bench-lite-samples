The hint suggests that the issue is in `pytest_runtest_makereport` in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Upon examining the provided code, it's clear that the function `pytest_runtest_makereport` processes different scenarios, including handling of `--runxfail`. The logic branches involved in handling skipped tests and xfail seem relevant to the issue since they directly deal with how and where skips are reported. The section that checks for `item.config.option.runxfail` and subsequent logic around `rep.skipped` and `rep.longrepr` could be the cause, as it might be incorrectly modifying the skip report location when `--runxfail` is used. Therefore, the entire span containing the function `pytest_runtest_makereport` is relevant to address this issue.",
