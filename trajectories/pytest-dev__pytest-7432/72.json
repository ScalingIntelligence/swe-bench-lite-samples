The function contains logic that processes various outcomes based on flags and conditions, such as `item.config.option.runxfail` which seems pertinent to the issue as the `--runxfail` option interferes with the expected behavior of skip location reporting. The relevant code spans include the logic around handling skips and the specific interaction with `item.config.option.runxfail`.
