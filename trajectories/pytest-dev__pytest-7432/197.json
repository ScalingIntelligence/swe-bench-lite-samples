The hint directly points to the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` as the place where the bug exists. The provided search results contain the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function which processes test outcomes and handles conditions related to `xfailed`, `unexpectedsuccess`, and other related keys. The analysis of the code within this function shows that it makes decisions based on the `--runxfail` option. Specifically, the `elif item.config.option.runxfail:` line seems to be the place where handling of `--runxfail` is implemented. This part of the function does nothing (`pass`) when the `--runxfail` option is used, which could be causing the issue of incorrect skip location reporting when this flag is present. Therefore, the key span of code related to this issue is the entire `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, with a focus on the `elif item.config.option.runxfail:` line and the surrounding logic.",
