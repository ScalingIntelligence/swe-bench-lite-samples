The expected behavior is that the skip location should point to the item itself, but with `--runxfail`, it points to another location within pytest, specifically `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The hint provided directly points to the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` as the location of the bug. Given this, the analysis focused on the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function within the provided search results. The function processes the report outcome and determines if a test should be marked as skipped or passed, considering the `--runxfail` flag's influence. It adjusts the report based on whether the test was skipped by a mark or experienced an unexpected success. The relevant code spans are those that handle the report modification for skipped tests and specifically those that might change the location reporting when `--runxfail` is used. The code also includes logic for handling xfail tests, which is related to the `--runxfail` flag's functionality but not the core issue of incorrect location reporting for skip marks. Therefore, the identified relevant spans are those influencing the reporting of skipped tests and their locations.",
