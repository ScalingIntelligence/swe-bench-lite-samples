This hook is responsible for handling the reporting of test results, including handling skips and xfails. The provided search results contain the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook implementation. The function processes various test outcomes and conditions, including handling of `@pytest.mark.skip` and `--runxfail`. The issue suggests that the location reporting for skips breaks under certain conditions, specifically when `--runxfail` is used. The code span within `pytest_runtest_makereport` that handles the reporting of skipped tests and includes conditions for `--runxfail` is likely where the bug resides. This is based on the understanding that the reported behavior change happens when `--runxfail` is added, indicating a direct interaction or error within the handling of this flag in the context of skip reporting.",
