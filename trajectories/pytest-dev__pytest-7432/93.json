The search results include the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, which is where the issue is expected to be. 4. Within this hook, there is logic that handles the `--runxfail` option and the reporting of test outcomes. Notably, there is a `pass` statement under the `if item.config.option.runxfail:` condition, which might suggest a possible place where the break in the skip location reporting could occur. 5.
