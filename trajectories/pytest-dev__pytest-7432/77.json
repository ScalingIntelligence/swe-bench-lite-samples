The hint points to the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` as the location of the bug. Upon reviewing the search results, the most relevant code span is indeed in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function. This function contains logic that checks for the `--runxfail` flag and alters the behavior of the test report based on the flag's presence. The issue likely arises from the conditional logic around `item.config.option.runxfail`, which may incorrectly modify the test report such that the skip location is reported from `src/_pytest/skipping.py` instead of the test file. This is consistent with the reported behavior where the skip location points to `src/_pytest/skipping.py` when `--runxfail` is used.",
