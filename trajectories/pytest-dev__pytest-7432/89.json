The expected behavior is that the skip location should point to the item itself, but adding `--runxfail` changes this to point to `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The hint suggests that the bug is in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` specifically in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. Given this information, it's clear that the relevant code span is within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function. This function is responsible for handling the reporting of test results, including skips and xfails. The code within this function checks for various conditions related to skipping and xfailing, and it modifies the report accordingly. The part of the code that is particularly relevant is where it handles the `item.config.option.runxfail` option, as this is the option that is breaking the expected behavior. Therefore, the identified code span is directly related to the issue and should be examined for potential fixes.",
