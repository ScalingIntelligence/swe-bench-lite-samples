Looking at the provided code snippet, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function handles various conditions related to skipping and xfailing tests. The issue likely arises from the condition handling `runxfail` which is expected to not affect the skip reporting but does. The code block inside `pytest_runtest_makereport` where `item.config.option.runxfail` is checked likely contains the bug as it seems to modify the behavior affecting the skip reporting.
