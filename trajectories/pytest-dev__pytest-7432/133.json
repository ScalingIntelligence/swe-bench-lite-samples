Upon examining the provided search results, two key areas are identified: the definition of the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook and a section within it that handles the `--runxfail` option. This section seems to be where the logic for xfail handling is implemented, which might inadvertently affect the skip location reporting when `--runxfail` is used. Therefore, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` span is identified as relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, since the issue is about the behavior of skip marks and how they are reported, the section dealing with the skipped state and its reporting within `pytest_runtest_makereport` is also crucial. Thus, both parts of the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook are considered relevant spans to address the reported issue.",
