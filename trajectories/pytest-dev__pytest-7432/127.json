The provided search results include the implementation of `pytest_runtest_makereport` in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, which is likely where the problem lies. The code within this hook handles various test outcomes, including skipped and xfailed tests.

This is demonstrated by the location of the skip changing from the test file to `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The hint provided directs attention to `pytest_runtest_makereport` in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, which is the primary focus for resolving this issue.\n\nFrom the initial analysis of the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, it handles the reporting of test outcomes, including the handling of skipped tests. The function changes the location of the failure to point to the item definition when skipped by a mark. However, the presence of the `--runxfail` flag seems to interfere with this process, altering the location reported.\n\nAdditional examination of the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function reveals that it includes conditional logic that checks for the presence of the `--runxfail` flag. This conditional logic is likely where the issue arises. A deeper analysis of how this flag interacts within the function is necessary to understand its impact fully on the reporting mechanism.\n\nConsidering the new search results, it's apparent that the relevant code spans include the `pytest_addoption`, `pytest_configure`, and `pytest_runtest_setup` functions, as they deal with the configuration and setup related to skip and xfail functionalities, which could influence how `pytest_runtest_makereport` operates. These additional functions can provide context on how options like `--runxfail` are processed and affect the test execution environment.",
