The hint suggests that the bug is in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook within `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The provided search results include the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, which is where the problem is likely to be. The function contains logic that handles the `--runxfail` flag, and it also deals with skipped tests. Specifically, the logic for handling skipped tests via marks and changing the location of the failure to point to the item definition might be interfering with the `--runxfail` flag. Given the detailed description in the reported issue and the alignment with the code in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, I am confident that this is the relevant section of code that needs to be addressed to fix the issue.
