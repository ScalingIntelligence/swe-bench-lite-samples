The expected behavior is that the skip location should point to the test itself, but it is instead pointing to `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The hint provided directly points to the bug being in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, specifically in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook.\n\nAnalyzing the code in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, the relevant section appears to be the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function. This function handles the reporting of test outcomes, and it includes specific logic related to `--runxfail`. The problematic behavior is likely being caused by the handling of `item.config.option.runxfail` and its subsequent effects on `rep.longrepr`, which indicates the location of the skip.\n\nThe key section to examine is the block inside `pytest_runtest_makereport` that checks for `item.config.option.runxfail`. Based on the issue description, any manipulation of `rep.longrepr` around this condition is likely the source of the problem. The line `pass` in the `runxfail` condition could be a candidate for the issue, as it does not seem to handle the skip location correction when `--runxfail` is enabled.",
