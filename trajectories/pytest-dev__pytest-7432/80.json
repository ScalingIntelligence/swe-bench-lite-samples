This suggests that the bug likely lies within the handling of these skip marks and the `--runxfail` option in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook, located in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Given the provided context and search results, we can identify several relevant code spans that could be contributing to the issue: Specifically, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook, which is responsible for creating test reports and may be where the location reporting bug manifests. Furthermore, the `evaluate_skip_marks` function is crucial for evaluating whether a test should be skipped, and its logic could be related to the bug if it interacts incorrectly with the `--runxfail` option.\n\nAdditionally, the `pytest_addoption` function is relevant as it defines the `--runxfail` option, meaning any logic tied to this option's behavior could be implicated. The interaction between these functions and the handling of skipped tests in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook will be key in diagnosing and fixing the reported issue. Thus, focusing on these sections of the code will be necessary.",
