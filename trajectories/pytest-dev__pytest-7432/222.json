Reviewing the provided `pytest_runtest_makereport` implementation in the search results, I notice that the handling of the `--runxfail` option might be interfering with the normal skip reporting mechanism. Specifically, the `elif item.config.option.runxfail:` block does not handle the skip reporting properly, which could be causing the reported issue where the skip location points to `src/_pytest/skipping.py` instead of the actual test file. This code span is directly related to the reported issue, as the `--runxfail` option and the modifications to the report due to skips are handled here.",
