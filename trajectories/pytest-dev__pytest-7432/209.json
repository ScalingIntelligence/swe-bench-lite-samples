The expected behavior is for the skip location to point to the item itself, but when `--runxfail` is used, it points to the internal `src/_pytest/skipping.py` file, indicating a bug. From the provided search results, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` is likely the source of the issue. It contains logic that handles various test outcomes, including when `--runxfail` is used, which suggests a potential bug where the skip location is not correctly reported. This function needs further inspection and possible modification to ensure correct behavior.",
