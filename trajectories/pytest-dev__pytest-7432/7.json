The problem specifically lies in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. This hook is responsible for generating the report after running tests, and the issue suggests that when `--runxfail` is used, the skip location is incorrectly reported as coming from `src/_pytest/skipping.py` rather than the test file itself. To address this, we need to focus on the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`.",
