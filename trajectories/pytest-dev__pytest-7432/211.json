After analyzing the provided code spans, it's clear that the code within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` span is directly related to handling test outcomes, including skips and xfails. This code is responsible for modifying the test report based on various conditions, including the `--runxfail` flag. Given the issue's description and the provided hint, the identified code span is relevant to the reported issue as it deals with the mechanics of how skips and xfails are reported during test execution. The section of the code where the `--runxfail` flag is handled also affects the reporting of skipped tests, aligning with the observed bug where the location reporting breaks.
