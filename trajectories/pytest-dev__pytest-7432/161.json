The issue is suspected to be in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook within this file. The provided search results contain the entire `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, which is the likely place to start looking for the bug. The function processes various outcomes, including unexpected successes, xfails, and skips. The section regarding skips, specifically where skips by mark are processed, involves modifying the location of the failure to point to the item definition. This is the relevant section to investigate further as it aligns with the reported issue.
