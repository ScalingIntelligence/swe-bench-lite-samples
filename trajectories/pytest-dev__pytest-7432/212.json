The hint provided indicates that the bug is in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, particularly in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook.\n\nUpon examining the provided code in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function is relevant as it handles the outcome of tests, including skips and xfails. The code section within this function checks for various conditions related to skips and xfails, including the handling of `--runxfail`. The specific behavior described in the issue occurs when handling skips under the influence of `--runxfail`, suggesting that the logic within this function might not be handling the `--runxfail` flag correctly in the context of skips.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code span to investigate further is the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, as it directly involves the logic that is likely responsible for the described behavior.",
