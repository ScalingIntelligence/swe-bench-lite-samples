The hint provided indicates that the bug is within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Upon examining the code in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, it is clear that the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function is indeed handling the logic for xfail and skip conditions. The section of code within `pytest_runtest_makereport` that specifically deals with the handling of skips and xfails, especially when `--runxfail` is used, should be reviewed. The relevant code spans are those that handle the skip marking and the xfail conditions. Specifically, the code block within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function that checks for `--runxfail` and the subsequent handling of `rep.longrepr` is the critical area to investigate for the reported issue.",
