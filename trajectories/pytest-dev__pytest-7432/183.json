Upon examining the code in the provided search results, we can see the function `pytest_runtest_makereport` which processes the outcome of tests, including handling skips and xfails. Notably, there's a conditional check for `item.config.option.runxfail` which simply passes, potentially leading to the issue where the skip location is not being correctly reported.
