The hint provided points to the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` as the source of the bug. Upon examining the provided code spans, it's clear that this hook is where the skip and xfail logic is handled. The piece of code where the dislocation issue arises is where the `--runxfail` flag is processed, which could potentially interfere with the normal skip reporting. Specifically, the condition `elif item.config.option.runxfail:` appears to be the point where the `runxfail` flag is checked, and it seems to miss handling the skip reporting correctly when this flag is present. Therefore, the relevant span to address the issue is the one identified by the id 'pytest_runtest_makereport'.",
