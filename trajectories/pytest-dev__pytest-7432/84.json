This suggests a potential issue within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook implementation in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Upon examination of the code, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook contains logic that handles the `--runxfail` option and skip reporting. Specifically, the code block that checks for the `--runxfail` option and processes the test outcome may be interfering with the correct reporting of skip locations. The identified code spans include the necessary logic for handling skip reporting and `--runxfail`. Therefore, it is likely that the bug causing the incorrect skip location reporting when using `--runxfail` is within this identified section of the code.",
