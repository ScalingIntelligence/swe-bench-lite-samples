This suggests a problem in how the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook is handling the `--runxfail` flag. In the provided search results, the code in the span with id 'pytest_runtest_makereport' contains the logic for handling the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. This is the most relevant part of the search results as it directly deals with the creation of test reports, including how the skip and xfail conditions are processed. The code checks the `runxfail` option and processes skipped and xfailed tests accordingly. The logic where it updates `rep.longrepr` based on `skipped_by_mark_key` also suggests that this might be the area where the reporting location is getting incorrectly set when `--runxfail` is used. Therefore, the span with id 'pytest_runtest_makereport' is directly relevant to the issue being reported.",
