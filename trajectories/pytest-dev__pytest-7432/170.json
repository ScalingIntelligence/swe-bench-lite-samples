Upon analyzing the provided code span in the search results, it is clear that this function is responsible for handling the reporting of test outcomes, including skips and xfails. The section of code inside `pytest_runtest_makereport` that deals with `--runxfail` is the primary suspect for the bug described. However, it also processes other conditions related to skip and xfail, which could be indirectly affected by the `--runxfail` option. The issue likely arises because of how the function handles the `--runxfail` option and subsequent reporting of skips, potentially leading to incorrect location reporting. This code span is directly relevant to the reported issue and should be examined in detail to identify and fix the bug.",
