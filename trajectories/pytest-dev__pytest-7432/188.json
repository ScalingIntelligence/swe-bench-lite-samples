Reviewing the provided search results, the code span identified by the id 'pytest_runtest_makereport' contains the implementation of this hook. Within this implementation, there is a specific handling for the `--runxfail` flag and handling of skipped tests. The logic for changing the location of the failure for skipped tests, if they are skipped by a mark, is also present. This part of the code looks relevant to the issue because it affects how and where the skip location is reported.
