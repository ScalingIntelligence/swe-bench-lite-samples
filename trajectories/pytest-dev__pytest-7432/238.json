When `--runxfail` is used along with `pytest.mark.skip`, the skip location reported points to the wrong place, specifically to `src/_pytest/skipping.py` instead of the test file itself. This indicates an issue with how pytest handles skips in conjunction with `--runxfail`. The hint suggests that the problem lies in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook within `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Consequently, the focus should be on this specific file and this specific hook to determine how `--runxfail` might be influencing the skip behavior.",
