The expected behavior is that the skip location should point to the test itself, but with `--runxfail`, it points to the internal skipping mechanism. The issue hints that the bug is in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, specifically in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. In the provided search results, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook implementation is found, which contains logic that processes skipped tests and handles the `--runxfail` flag. The code block checks for the `--runxfail` flag and potentially alters the behavior of reporting skipped tests. This code span is highly relevant to the reported issue because it directly deals with the pytest hooks and flags affecting the skip behavior.",
