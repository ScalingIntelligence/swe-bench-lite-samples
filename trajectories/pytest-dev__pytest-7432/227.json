The expected behavior is that the skip location should point to the item itself, but with `--runxfail`, it points to a different location within `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The hint provided indicates that the bug is in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in this file. The analysis of the provided code shows that the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function is handling various conditions related to skips and failures. Specifically, the condition `if item.config.option.runxfail: pass` might be causing the issue as it doesn't properly handle the skip reporting when `--runxfail` is used. The relevant code spans to investigate further are around this condition and the logic for handling skipped tests.",
