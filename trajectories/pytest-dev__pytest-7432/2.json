The hint provided points to the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` as the possible location of the bug. Upon examining the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, it is clear that the logic handling the `--runxfail` flag and the reporting of skipped tests is intertwined. The code checks if the test was skipped by a mark and adjusts the reporting location accordingly, but this logic is broken when `--runxfail` is used. The relevant code spans include the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function and the surrounding context that handles the `--runxfail` flag and skip marks.",
