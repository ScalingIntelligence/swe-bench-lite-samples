The hint points towards the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Upon analyzing the provided search results, the section of code under the 'pytest_runtest_makereport' span is indeed where the handling of skipped and xfailed tests is managed. Specifically, the condition `elif item.config.option.runxfail:` (within the 'pytest_runtest_makereport' span) seems to be the potential cause, as it doesn't handle the skip reporting correctly when `--runxfail` is enabled. This condition directly affects how skips are reported, as evidenced by the issue description where the skip location changes to an internal pytest location when `--runxfail` is used. Therefore, I have identified the relevant code span that requires further investigation or modification to resolve the issue.",
