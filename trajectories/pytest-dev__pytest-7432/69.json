The provided search results contain relevant code in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, particularly the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook which is suspected to be the cause of the bug. This function processes the outcome of test runs and modifies the report for different scenarios, including skipped tests and `--runxfail` handling. The problem seems to arise in the code block where the report is being modified based on the presence of `--runxfail`. Specifically, the code block already identifies this issue by checking and altering the report location if a test is skipped by mark. Therefore, the identified span `pytest_runtest_makereport` directly relates to the problem described in the reported issue, making it highly relevant for further debugging and fixing the issue.",
