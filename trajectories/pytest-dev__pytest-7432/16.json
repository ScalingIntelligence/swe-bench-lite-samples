The search results contain the relevant file `src/_pytest/skipping.py` with multiple code spans including the hooks `pytest_runtest_setup`, `pytest_runtest_call`, and `pytest_runtest_makereport` which are directly related to test execution and reporting. Specifically, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook is of particular interest as it handles the creation of test report objects, where the reported issue might be occurring. The hook contains logic that checks for `xfailed` tests and modifies the report accordingly, potentially interfering with the normal skip reporting. Additionally, the `pytest_runtest_setup` hook also checks for `skip` and `xfail` marks before test execution, which might contribute to the issue if not handled correctly in the context of `--runxfail`.
