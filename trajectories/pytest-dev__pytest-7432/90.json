The key to solving this issue lies in the `src/_pytest/skipping.py` file, specifically in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. The search results provided include relevant parts of this file, particularly showing how `pytest_runtest_makereport` handles different scenarios, including checks for `item.config.option.runxfail`. The provided code contains the logic for handling `runxfail` and managing the outcome and location of test results. Given the issue description and the provided code, it appears that the code span within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook is directly related to the problem, particularly where there is a conditional check related to `item.config.option.runxfail`. This is likely where the bug causing the incorrect skipping location is occurring. By focusing on this segment of code, it should be possible to correctly diagnose and potentially fix the issue regarding the behavior of `--runxfail` with test skipping in pytest. The code spans involving `StoreKey` usage are also relevant as they define the keys used for storing skip and fail metadata during test execution, influencing how reporting is done, therefore they should also be noted for a complete understanding of the context.",
