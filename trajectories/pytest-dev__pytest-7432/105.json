The hint suggests that the bug is in 'src/_pytest/skipping.py', specifically around the 'pytest_runtest_makereport' hook. By analyzing the provided search results, I see that 'src/_pytest/skipping.py' contains the code implementing the pytest_runtest_makereport hook, which includes various conditions for skipping and xfailing tests, and importantly, a check related to the '--runxfail' option. The condition 'elif item.config.option.runxfail:' seems crucial as it directly relates to the --runxfail flag. Given the issue's description and the functionality around '--runxfail', the code within this hook is very likely where the problem lies, as it's used for generating test reports and could potentially be altering the skip location incorrectly when --runxfail is used.",
