The issue points directly to the `src/_pytest/skipping.py` file and the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook as the source of the problem. The provided search results include the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function which is responsible for generating the test result reports. In this function, there's a check for the `--runxfail` option which may be incorrectly affecting the handling of skipped tests. The function logic needs to ensure that the location of the skip is correctly reported, and it seems the logic related to `--runxfail` might be interfering with this. There's a specific block handling `skipped_by_mark_key` that adjusts the skip location, and this is likely where the correction needs to be made. Therefore, the identified span directly corresponds to the reported issue and the hint provided.",
