The hint points directly to the `src/_pytest/skipping.py` file and specifically the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. By examining the provided code span in this file, I can see that the function `pytest_runtest_makereport` handles various outcomes of test runs, including skipped and xfailed tests. The logic for handling `--runxfail` is present in the function, and it directly influences how the report for a test run is generated. Based on the issue description, it seems like the presence of `--runxfail` is causing the skip location to be reported incorrectly. This incorrect reporting is likely due to the logic within this function that checks for `--runxfail` and decides how to handle the test outcomes accordingly.\n\nGiven the hint and the code provided, I can confidently say that the relevant code span for addressing the issue is within the implementation of the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function.
