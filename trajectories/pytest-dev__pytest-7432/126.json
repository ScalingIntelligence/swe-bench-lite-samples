This might be where the issue lies, as it might not be handling the skip reporting correctly when xfail is being run. Additionally, reviewing the `evaluate_xfail_marks` function and how it interacts with the skip logic is necessary to understand the entire behavior of skipped tests in conjunction with `--runxfail`. This might reveal how the interaction between xfail and skip causes the location reporting to be incorrect.",
