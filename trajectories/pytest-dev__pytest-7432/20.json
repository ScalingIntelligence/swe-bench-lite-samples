The hint directly points to `src/_pytest/skipping.py` and the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook, which is where the problem lies. By examining the provided code span in `pytest_runtest_makereport`, it's clear that the handling of the `--runxfail` option is what's causing the issue. The condition `elif item.config.option.runxfail:` with a `pass` statement suggests that it might be skipping necessary checks for skipping and xfail handling, which could be affecting the location reporting of skipped tests. Therefore, the provided search results are highly relevant to the reported issue.
