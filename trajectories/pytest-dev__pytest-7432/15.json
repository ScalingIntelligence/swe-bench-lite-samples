The hint directly points to `src/_pytest/skipping.py` and specifically the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. Upon analysis of the provided code, the relevant section is indeed the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, particularly where the `--runxfail` option is handled. The logic seems to handle various conditions including `xfailed`, `unexpectedsuccess`, and `skipped` statuses. The issue described suggests that when `--runxfail` is used, the location reporting for skips is incorrectly pointing to internal pytest code instead of the test itself. This indicates that the problem lies in how `--runxfail` interacts or doesn't interact with the skip handling within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function.\n\nGiven this, the most relevant code span is the one containing the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, which includes checks for the `--runxfail` option and various conditions that affect test outcomes. Further investigation into this span might reveal the exact point where the location reporting for skips is getting misdirected when `--runxfail` is active.",
