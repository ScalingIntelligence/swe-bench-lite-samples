The hint provided points directly to `src/_pytest/skipping.py` and mentions the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook as the place to look for the bug. By examining the `pytest_runtest_makereport` implementation, it's clear that the function processes test outcomes and handles various conditions like `xfail`, `skip`, and unexpected success. The relevant part of the code is where the `--runxfail` option is handled, which might be interfering with the reporting of skipped tests. The code snippet within `pytest_runtest_makereport` processes different scenarios and conditionally modifies the report based on whether `--runxfail` is set. This is likely where the issue lies, as the expected behavior is for the skip location to be reported at the test itself, not in the pytest internals.",
