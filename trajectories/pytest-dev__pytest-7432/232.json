The expected behavior is that the skip location should point to the item itself, but `--runxfail` seems to break this, pointing instead to the location within `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The issue hints that the bug is related to the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Reviewing the code in this file, it's clear that the logic around the handling of `runxfail` and the reporting of skipped tests is located within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function. This function contains the logic for determining the outcome of a test run, including handling unexpected successes, xfail conditions, and skips. The specific section of interest is where the `--runxfail` option is checked, and potentially where the behavior diverges from expected. By examining this span, it's evident that this is the main area of the code where the reported issue might be manifesting. The remaining code spans in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` do not directly relate to the `--runxfail` issue or the reporting of skip locations.",
