I carefully reviewed the code in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` and found the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function. This function contains logic that handles the reporting of test outcomes, including skips and xfails. The relevant part of the function is where it checks the `item.config.option.runxfail` condition, which should not affect the skip location reporting. However, the issue description suggests that this condition is affecting the skip location reporting, and indeed the code does not handle the `--runxfail` option correctly in this context, potentially causing the reported problem.",
