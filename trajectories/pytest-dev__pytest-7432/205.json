The hint points directly to `src/_pytest/skipping.py` and the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. Reviewing the provided code, the key section is where the outcome of the test run is processed, specifically handling skips and xfails. The detailed examination reveals the conditional logic that changes the reporting location based on whether a test is skipped by a mark or due to other conditions like xfail. Given the issue, the relevant part is the handling of skips when `--runxfail` is active. The identified code span with id 'pytest_runtest_makereport' is directly related to the issue at hand as it contains the logic that decides the outcome and location of the reporting for skipped tests.",
