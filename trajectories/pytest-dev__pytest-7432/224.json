Specifically, it outlines that the skip location reporting is disrupted by `--runxfail`, which should not affect these marks. The hint provided directly indicates that the bug is located within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Upon analyzing the code in this file, particularly the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, it becomes evident that the processing related to `--runxfail` is adjacent to the handling of skipped tests. This proximity suggests that the logic for handling the skip conditions might be inadvertently affected by the introduction of `--runxfail`. The provided code snippet confirms this by showing that the function checks the `--runxfail` flag in a context where skip and xfail conditions are being differentiated. This suggests that any alteration in the handling of xfails might inadvertently shift the behavior for skips, potentially leading to incorrect location reporting as described in the issue.",
