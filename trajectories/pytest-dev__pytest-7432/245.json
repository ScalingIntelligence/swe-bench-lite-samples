The hint points directly to `src/_pytest/skipping.py` and specifically the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. Upon examining the provided code, it's evident that the mentioned hook is responsible for handling various scenarios including how tests are reported and handled when marked with `skip` and `xfail`. The logic within the hook deals with various conditions to determine the outcome and longrepr of the reports. There is a specific handling for `--runxfail` that seems to pass over the normal behavior, potentially causing the issue by not properly handling the skip location. Thus, the identified relevant code span is the entire block within `pytest_runtest_makereport`, as it directly pertains to the reported issue by dealing with the core logic of test reporting influenced by the `--runxfail` flag. This block is crucial for understanding and fixing the bug where the skip location is not correctly reported when `--runxfail` is used.",
