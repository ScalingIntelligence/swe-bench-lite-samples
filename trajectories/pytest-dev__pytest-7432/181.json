Upon analysis of the provided search results, it is evident that the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function contains logic that handles the reporting of test outcomes, including skips and xfails. The code snippet checks for various conditions related to xfails and unexpected successes, but it does not explicitly handle the scenario where `--runxfail` is used in conjunction with skips, which could be the root cause of the issue. Considering this, the relevant code span to address the reported issue would be the section within `pytest_runtest_makereport` where the outcome of the test is determined, especially the part that handles skips and the use of `--runxfail`.",
