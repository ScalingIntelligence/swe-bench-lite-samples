Upon examining the provided code from the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook, it's clear that there are conditions that handle various outcomes like unexpected successes, xfails, and skips. The problematic behavior described, where the skip location is incorrectly reported when `--runxfail` is used, might be related to the logic handling of `--runxfail` within this hook.
