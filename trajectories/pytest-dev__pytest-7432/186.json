The hint suggests focusing on the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Upon analysis of the provided code, there are several key points to consider:\n\n1. **Configuration and Option Handling:**\n   - The `pytest_addoption` and `pytest_configure` functions handle the `--runxfail` option and configure the environment accordingly. This setup might interfere with the normal behavior of skip markers.\n\n2. **Mark Evaluation:**\n   - Functions like `evaluate_skip_marks` and `evaluate_xfail_marks` evaluate test marks and determine whether to skip or mark a test as xfail.\n\n3. **Hook Implementations:**\n   - The `pytest_runtest_setup`, `pytest_runtest_call`, and `pytest_runtest_makereport` hooks play crucial roles in setting up, calling, and reporting test outcomes, respectively. The last one is particularly relevant as per the hint.\n\n4. **Reporting Logic:**\n   - In `pytest_runtest_makereport`, there's a specific block handling the reporting of skipped tests, particularly: `if item._store.get(skipped_by_mark_key, True) and rep.skipped and type(rep.longrepr) is tuple`. This block adjusts the reported location of skipped tests, which might be where the discrepancy arises when `--runxfail` is used.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, it appears the issue could stem from the interaction between the `--runxfail` option and the reporting logic in `pytest_runtest_makereport`. The relevant code spans to investigate further are those handling the skip mark evaluation and the reporting of test outcomes within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function.",
