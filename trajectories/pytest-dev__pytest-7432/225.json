The provided search results contain the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function which is directly related to how pytest handles test outcomes including skips and xfails. The function logic specifically addresses the handling of `--runxfail` and the assignment of outcomes like 'skipped', which aligns with the described issue. The detailed logic in the function involving `item.config.option.runxfail` and the handling of `rep.outcome` suggests this part of the code is critical to the functionality affected by the `--runxfail` option breaking skip location reporting.
