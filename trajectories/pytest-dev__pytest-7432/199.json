The issue is focused on the `src/_pytest/skipping.py` file, specifically within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. From the search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function where the location of the skip is determined and potentially altered depending on the conditions such as the `--runxfail` flag. The key section to investigate is the last block within `pytest_runtest_makereport`, which manipulates the report's location if the test was skipped by a mark. This aligns with the hint provided in the issue description. Thus, I have identified the relevant code spans that should be examined to resolve the issue.",
