Upon reviewing the provided code in the search results, it's clear that the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function is responsible for handling the reporting of test outcomes, including skips and xfails. The issue likely arises from the logic that handles the `--runxfail` option, where it seems to incorrectly override or interfere with the normal skip reporting.
