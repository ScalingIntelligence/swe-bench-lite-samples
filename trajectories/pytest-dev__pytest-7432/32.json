Specifically, the issue is that the skip location is incorrectly reported when --runxfail is used. The hint points to the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Upon inspecting the provided code span, it can be observed that the logic handling the `--runxfail` option checks for the presence of the option and then proceeds without special handling for the skip scenario. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the --runxfail option interacts with the skip handling logic, potentially causing the skip location to be reported incorrectly. Given the hint and the reported issue, the code span identified around `pytest_runtest_makereport` is highly relevant as it directly deals with the pytest hooks and conditional logic related to skip and xfail handling. Therefore, this code span should be considered as relevant to the reported issue.",
