The issue points directly to src/_pytest/skipping.py and the pytest_runtest_makereport hook. \n\nUpon reviewing the provided search results, specifically the code span with id 'pytest_runtest_makereport', it is clear that this hook is responsible for processing the test results, including handling skips and xfails. The relevant part of the code checks if the test was skipped due to a pytest mark and if so, adjusts the reporting to point to the item definition instead of the location where the skip exception was raised. This is exactly where the issue points to, especially given the hint provided in the issue. \n\nThe code span with id 'pytest_runtest_makereport' is therefore highly relevant to the reported issue as it contains the logic that determines the reporting behavior of skipped tests. This section of the code is likely where the bug leading to incorrect location reporting under the --runxfail option can be found or fixed.",
