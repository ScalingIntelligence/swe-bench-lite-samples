The hint suggests that the bug is in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` specifically in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook. The provided search results include code spans within `src/_pytest/skipping.py` that are relevant to this issue. Notably, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` span contains code that handles the reporting of test outcomes, including the processing of xfail and skip marks. This section of code checks for the `--runxfail` option and adjusts the reporting behavior based on whether an unexpected success or xfail condition is encountered. It also changes the location of the failure for skipped items. Based on the reported issue and the code's functionality, I identified the `pytest_runtest_makereport` span as relevant to the problem. Additionally, I checked other spans related to `--runxfail` and skipping, but they do not directly affect the reported issue.",
