The hint suggests that the bug is in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in the same file. After analyzing the provided code, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function contains the logic for handling different test outcomes, including skips and xfails. The section where the location of the skip is modified is relevant to the issue. Specifically, the logic that changes the location of the failure to point to the item definition if the item is skipped by `mark.skipif` is of interest. The provided code includes this logic, and it seems to be the part that handles the skip location reporting. Therefore, the relevant code span is the one containing the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function.",
