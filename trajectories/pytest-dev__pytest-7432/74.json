The hint provided directly points to a specific function in the pytest skipping module: `pytest_runtest_makereport`. This function is responsible for handling the output report of test runs, including the handling of skipped tests. The detailed error reporting when `--runxfail` is used indicates that the skip location is incorrectly attributed to the pytest skipping module rather than the actual test file. Comparing the context provided with the new search results, the relevant code span has not changed. However, it does match the identified issue in terms of handling the skip condition and potentially being the culprit for the location reporting error when `--runxfail` is used.
