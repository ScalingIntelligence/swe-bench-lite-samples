Upon analyzing the provided code, the relevant section is indeed within `pytest_runtest_makereport`. The code handles various conditions including `xfail`, `skip`, and `unexpected success`. The issue might be related to the handling of `xfail` when `--runxfail` is enabled, which somehow interacts incorrectly with the skip logic. The specific code span that processes the skip logic within `pytest_runtest_makereport` is where the bug likely lies. Specifically, the condition involving `item.config.option.runxfail` and subsequent logic might be causing the undesired behavior. The relevant code span is identified and will be reported.",
