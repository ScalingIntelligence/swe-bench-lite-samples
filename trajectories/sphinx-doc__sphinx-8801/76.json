To address this, we need to look into how autodoc handles the documentation of class attributes, especially those inherited from superclasses. From the provided search results, several key areas are relevant:\n\n1. The `AttributeDocumenter` class, particularly its `get_doc` method, which determines how the documentation for an attribute is retrieved. This method checks for comments and handles the inheritance of docstrings, which are crucial for understanding how the 'undocumented' status is determined.\n2. The `ClassDocumenter` class focuses on documenting classes. Its `get_doc` method retrieves the docstrings for classes and manages the inheritance of docstrings. This could be relevant if the behavior of documenting attributes is influenced by how classes are documented in general.\n3. The `get_class_members` function in `importer.py`, which retrieves all class members, including annotations from superclasses. This function could be where the 'undocumented' status is initially determined for inherited attributes.\n\nBy examining these areas, we can better understand how inherited attributes are being handled and potentially identify why the issue occurs. The `AttributeDocumenter.get_doc` and `ClassDocumenter.get_doc` methods are particularly relevant, along with the `get_class_members` function, as they directly involve the handling and retrieval of attribute documentation and inheritance.",
