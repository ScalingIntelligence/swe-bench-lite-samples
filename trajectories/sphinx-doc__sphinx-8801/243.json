This leads to attributes not being shown in the documentation without explicitly enabling the ':undoc-members:' option. The focus should be on the autodoc extension's handling of class attributes and their annotations when inherited. The relevant files and classes to inspect are 'Documenter', 'ClassDocumenter', 'AttributeDocumenter', and possibly 'DocstringSignatureMixin' within the 'sphinx.ext.autodoc' module. Also, look into functions or methods that handle member filtering and documentation generation.",

The search results provide several relevant spans in the `Documenter` class and its subclasses like `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter`. These spans cover methods responsible for fetching documentation, filtering and adding members, and handling inherited members. Specifically, the `Documenter.get_doc`, `Documenter.add_content`, `Documenter.filter_members`, and `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` methods are likely to be particularly relevant for addressing the issue of inherited members being treated as undocumented. The `AttributeDocumenter.add_directive_header` and `AttributeDocumenter.get_doc` methods are also relevant as they deal with attribute documentation.

The `ClassDocumenter` class is responsible for documenting classes and their members, including inherited ones, while the `AttributeDocumenter` specifically deals with the documentation of class attributes.\n\nThe code spans in the search results confirm the focus on these classes and their methods. Notably, the methods such as `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, `get_doc`, and `add_directive_header` in both `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` are crucial as they deal with the retrieval, filtering, and presentation of class members and their documentation. The logic within these methods will need to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure that inherited members with annotations are not incorrectly marked as undocumented.\n\nThe issue suggests a need to enhance the logic in these methods to better identify and document inherited members with annotations. This could involve updating the filtering logic in `filter_members` to recognize inherited attributes with annotations, and ensuring that the documentation generation process in `get_doc` correctly handles and displays these attributes.\n\nOverall, the task involves a careful analysis and modification of the existing code to improve the handling of inherited, annotated members in the documentation generation process.",

Upon examining the current file context and the new search results, a few key areas are identified which could be relevant to addressing this issue:\n\n1. **Documenter.filter_members**: This method is responsible for filtering the members of an object. It contains logic that determines whether certain members should be documented based on their docstrings and other criteria, including whether they are inherited. This function might need to be adjusted to ensure that annotation-only members inherited from a superclass are not mistakenly flagged as 'undocumented'.\n\n2. **ClassDocumenter.get_object_members**: This method retrieves the members of a class. It includes handling for both the class's own members and inherited members, which is directly relevant to the issue of documented inherited attributes.\n\n3. **AttributeDocumenter**: This class deals with documenting attributes. Given the issue involves attributes (specifically, those that are type-annotated but lack explicit docstrings), methods such as `AttributeDocumenter.add_directive_header` and `AttributeDocumenter.get_doc` are of interest, as they handle how attribute documentation is generated and displayed.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that further adjustments in `filter_members`, possibly in conjunction with updates to how `AttributeDocumenter` handles annotations, could help resolve the issue of annotation-only members being marked as 'undocumented'.\n\nThe search task appears to be minimally complete, as the identified areas do answer the core question of where adjustments might be needed to address the reported issue with documenting annotation-only members.
