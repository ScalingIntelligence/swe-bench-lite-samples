Specifically, the attribute 'attr1' in the superclass 'Foo' is not being documented when using the 'autoclass' directive for subclass 'Bar', even when 'inherited-members' is specified. I analyzed the provided code spans in 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' and found that the 'ClassDocumenter' class is relevant, as it deals with documenting classes and their members. The '__init__' method is also critical as it sets up the documenter. More importantly, the 'get_object_members' method checks for inherited members and adds them to the documentation list based on certain conditions. The code in 'get_object_members' seems to handle the inclusion of inherited members based on the 'inherited-members' option and should be further analyzed to ensure it correctly handles the inclusion of annotation-only members like 'attr1' in this case. This method currently filters members based on the 'inherited-members' option and the 'members' option, which suggests that the handling of annotation-only members might be missing or incorrectly implemented in this logic.",

However, given the nature of the issue, additional attention should be given to the AttributeDocumenter class and its methods since they specifically deal with the documentation of attributes. The method 'get_object_members' in the ClassDocumenter class is tasked with retrieving members of the class, and the 'filter_members' method (not shown in the provided context) would likely be involved in determining which members to document. Additionally, the 'add_content' and 'get_doc' methods in AttributeDocumenter and ClassDocumenter respectively might play a role in determining the documentation status of attributes, including those inherited. The search should extend to find the 'filter_members' method and closely inspect the 'add_content' and 'get_doc' methods in both classes.",
