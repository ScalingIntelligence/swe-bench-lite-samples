This suggests a problem in how the autodoc module processes inherited members and their annotations. Given the nature of the problem, focusing on the ClassDocumenter and AttributeDocumenter classes within the autodoc module is crucial. These classes are likely responsible for how members (especially attributes) are documented and inherited in subclasses.",
