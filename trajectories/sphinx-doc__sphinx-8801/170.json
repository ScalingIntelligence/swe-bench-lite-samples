To address this, we need to identify the code responsible for handling inherited members in the autodoc module. The search results provide three key spans from the 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' file. The 'ClassDocumenter' class is the primary focus as it deals with documenting classes, including handling their members and inherited members. The '__init__' and 'get_object_members' spans within this class show initialization and the method responsible for fetching member objects. The 'get_object_members' method is particularly relevant as it controls which members are documented, including inherited ones, and how they are filtered based on options. This method's logic aligns with the issue description, suggesting that the handling of inherited members could be missing or incorrect for annotated attributes. Therefore, these spans are highly relevant to the reported issue.",

This issue specifically occurs when using the 'inherited-members' option. The relevant code spans provided in the search results indicate that the `ClassDocumenter` class handles the processing of inherited members using the `get_object_members` method. This method includes logic to include or exclude members based on the presence of inherited members in the options. The initial file context provided also includes relevant spans that touch on similar functionalities such as merging members options and defining the `ClassDocumenter` class.
