This can affect the documentation process for classes that inherit members from their superclasses. We already have identified and analyzed some relevant code spans in the 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' file, which handles the documentation process for classes. Specifically, the ClassDocumenter class and its methods like `get_object_members` are crucial for deciding which members to document and how to document them. The new search results reaffirm our focus on the ClassDocumenter class with additional details on the `get_object_members` method, which is responsible for collecting members, including inherited ones, to document. We need to ensure that inherited members, especially those with annotations, are treated correctly when generating documentation. The search results include crucial spans such as 'inherited_members_option' and the ClassDocumenter's `get_object_members` method, which will help us in tracking down the logic controlling the inclusion of inherited members. These findings suggest that the problem could be where inherited members are being checked or documented within the get_object_members method or the broader ClassDocumenter framework. Considering all these, the identified spans align with the reported issue, and further analysis within these code spans will likely lead to a resolution or pinpoint the exact bug in the processing of inherited members.",
