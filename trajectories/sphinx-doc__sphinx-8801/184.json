Specifically, annotations only members in a superclass are being treated as 'undocumented' and not being included in the generated documentation. The search results contain several relevant code spans in the `Documenter` class and its subclasses (`ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter`). These classes and their methods (`get_object_members`) are directly involved in determining which members are included in the documentation. The issue can likely be resolved by adjusting the logic in these methods to ensure that inherited members, including those with only annotations, are correctly identified and included in the documentation when the `:inherited-members:` option is used. The provided code spans show how the `get_object_members` method processes members based on the `want_all` parameter and the `inherited_members` option, suggesting a potential point of intervention to address the reported issue.",
