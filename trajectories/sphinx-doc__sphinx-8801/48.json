This behavior can be observed in the example provided, where 'Bar.attr1' from the subclass 'Bar' that inherits from 'Foo' does not appear in the documentation unless the ':undoc-members:' option is explicitly specified. To diagnose this, we should focus our search on the autodoc extension's handling of inherited members, particularly the 'ClassDocumenter' class and related methods such as 'get_object_members' and 'filter_members', which are likely responsible for determining what members are documented.",

In the provided search results, the code spans related to the Documenter class and its methods are relevant. Specifically, the `filter_members` method within the Documenter class is crucial as it determines which members are documented and which are not. The logic inside `filter_members` defines conditions for including or excluding members based on various criteria, including whether the member is documented or not and whether it is a member of a specified superclass. The method uses the `is_filtered_inherited_member` function to check if a member belongs to a specified superclass, which is relevant to the issue at hand.
