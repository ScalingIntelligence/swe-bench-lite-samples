This problem is evident in the `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` classes within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. Specifically, the `ClassDocumenter` class is responsible for documenting classes, including inherited members, while the `AttributeDocumenter` class documents individual attributes, which includes handling inherited attributes. \n\nThe key areas to focus on are the `get_object_members` method within `ClassDocumenter`, which determines which members to document, including inherited ones, and the `get_doc` method within `AttributeDocumenter`, which retrieves and processes the docstrings for attributes. The issue likely arises from how these members are being flagged or processed as undocumented. The current implementation in `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` does not explicitly handle the documentation status of inherited members, and the `AttributeDocumenter.get_doc` method does not seem to explicitly check for inherited docstrings without overriding local ones. These areas must be investigated and possibly adjusted to ensure that inherited attributes, even if they only have type annotations in the superclass, are properly documented.",
