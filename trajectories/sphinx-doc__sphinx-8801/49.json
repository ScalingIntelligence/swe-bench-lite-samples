The attribute `attr1` from the superclass `Foo` is not being documented when `Bar` is documented, even though it should be treated as documented due to its annotation and docstring. This might be related to the `filter_members`, `get_object_members`, or `get_doc` methods in the `ClassDocumenter` class within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module. Additionally, the `_getannotations` function in the `importer` module could also be relevant, as it deals with fetching annotations from the class. To address this, searches should be focused on these specific methods and functions.",

Additionally, the `filter_members` method also plays a crucial role in determining which members to document, and it needs to be examined to ensure that annotated members from superclasses are not filtered out.

Specifically, adjust the logic to recognize annotations as a form of documentation, especially when handling options like `undoc_members` and `inherited_members`.\n\nThe instruction requires modifications within the filter_members method, particularly how it handles members with type annotations from inherited classes, and how it uses options like undoc_members and inherited_members. The areas of focus include the logic around inherited member checks and type annotations.",
