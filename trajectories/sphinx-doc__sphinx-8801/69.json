The primary classes involved in documenting classes and their members in the sphinx.ext.autodoc module are `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter`. \n\nThe `ClassDocumenter` class is responsible for documenting classes, handling the import of class objects, and retrieving their members. The method `get_object_members` is particularly relevant as it retrieves the members of the class, including those inherited. It checks if the `inherited_members` option is set and fetches members accordingly.\n\nThe `AttributeDocumenter` class deals with documenting attributes of a class. The method `import_object` imports the object and handles specific cases like enum attributes. The method `get_doc` retrieves the docstring for the attribute, including handling comments and docstrings specifically for attributes. \n\nGiven the issue, it appears that the logic might not be correctly handling inherited attributes, especially those with only annotations and no additional docstrings. Focusing on the `ClassDocumenter`'s handling of inherited members in `get_object_members` and ensuring that `AttributeDocumenter` appropriately captures and documents these inherited members is crucial. The identified spans in `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` should be examined and potentially modified to ensure that annotation-only inherited attributes are correctly documented.\n\nOverall, the identified spans are likely relevant for addressing the issue, as they directly relate to the handling and documentation of class members and attributes in the context of inheritance.",

This issue specifically needs to address the handling of inherited members and the 'undoc-members' option. The search results show the relevant parts of the 'ClassDocumenter' and 'AttributeDocumenter' classes which manage the documentation of classes and attributes, respectively. Key areas to look into include the handling of 'inherited-members' and 'undoc-members' options in 'ClassDocumenter' and how 'AttributeDocumenter' processes and documents attributes. From the search results, it's evident that the 'ClassDocumenter' class uses methods like 'get_object_members' and 'get_doc' to manage class documentation, while 'AttributeDocumenter' has similar methods tailored for attributes. The issue likely lies in how the 'ClassDocumenter' handles the inherited members and whether it properly checks for the undocumented members to include in the output, which aligns with the 'undoc-members' option usage.",

The main concern is that these inherited members are treated as 'undocumented' and are not shown in the generated documentation unless the ':undoc-members:' option is explicitly set. This issue is likely related to how the `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` classes handle the options and inherited members in the autodoc extension. Upon reviewing the search results and the current context, it's clear that both `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` are crucial for understanding how the autodoc extension processes class and attribute documentation, including inherited members. The relevant methods within `ClassDocumenter` include `__init__`, `import_object`, `get_object_members`, and `get_doc`, as well as the options handling in `AttributeDocumenter`. The search results provide a detailed look at how these classes and methods are implemented, particularly focusing on how they handle inherited members and options like 'inherited-members' and 'undoc-members'. This detailed review is necessary to identify the specific part of the code that might be causing the issue with treating annotation-only members of a superclass as 'undocumented'.
