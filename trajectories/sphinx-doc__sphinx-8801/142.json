The user has encountered a situation where an annotated member (attr1) from a superclass (Foo) is not documented in the subclass (Bar), unless the :undoc-members: option is explicitly used. This suggests that the member is being treated as 'undocumented' and is being filtered out under default conditions.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, we can see that the ClassDocumenter class is central to the documentation process. It includes methods for initializing the documenter and for handling class members. Specifically, the `merge_members_option` function and the `get_object_members` method in the ClassDocumenter class are key to understanding how members are included or excluded based on the options provided.\n\nThe `filter_members` method is also significant, as it determines which members are included in the documentation based on their documentation status (docstring presence), privacy, and other options. The logic related to handling options like 'undoc-members' and 'inherited-members' is particularly relevant, as this issue likely involves how these options are interpreted and applied.\n\nThe 'setup' function and the various Documenter subclasses indicate how different types of objects are documented and how options are configured. This is important for deriving a full understanding of how documentation generation is managed in Sphinx.\n\nGiven this context, the identified spans are relevant because they encapsulate the logic responsible for determining which members are documented and under what conditions. These spans involve functions and methods that directly influence the inclusion of members based on their docstrings and inheritance status.",

However, annotations on these inherited members might not be fully processed or considered when generating the documentation. This discrepancy may lead to annotated members being incorrectly flagged as undocumented. Specifically, the `filter_members` method, which is crucial for determining which members to document, could be the root cause if it fails to properly handle annotations or if the logic for identifying undocumented members is flawed.
