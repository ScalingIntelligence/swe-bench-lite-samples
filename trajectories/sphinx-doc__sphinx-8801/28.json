The expected behavior is that inherited members should be documented unless explicitly excluded.\n\nReviewing the provided code spans, the relevant sections primarily involve the `ClassDocumenter` class and its methods, particularly `get_object_members`. This method is responsible for retrieving the members of the class that are to be documented. The method's logic should ensure that inherited members are included if the `inherited_members` option is set. The code spans from the search results confirm this, showing how the `get_object_members` method processes inherited members based on the `inherited_members` option.\n\nAdditionally, the `get_object_members` function in the `importer.py` file is involved in retrieving members, including those from superclasses. This function may also play a role in the issue, as it handles the retrieval and classification of members, including annotations.\n\nGiven this context, the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the issue.

The key elements to focus on are the methods and classes involved in documenting class members, particularly those involved in handling inherited members. From the provided search results, several relevant code spans were identified. These include the `merge_members_option` function which is used to combine members from different options, the `ClassDocumenter` class which is responsible for documenting classes and their members, and the `get_object_members` method which is crucial for retrieving members of a class. The `AttributeDocumenter` class is also relevant as it documents attributes, which includes the type annotations in question.
