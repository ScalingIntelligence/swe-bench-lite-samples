The goal is to find the relevant code where autodoc processes class members, especially focusing on how inherited members are documented. Since the issue mentions 'undocumented' and the need to filter members, it's essential to look at methods related to member filtering and documentation in classes like `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. Additionally, methods related to importing and processing class members in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` might also be relevant.
