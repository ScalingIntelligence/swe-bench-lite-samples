The `ClassDocumenter` class is relevant due to its responsibility for documenting classes in the Sphinx autodoc process. Specifically, the `get_doc` method of `ClassDocumenter` is of interest, as it determines the docstrings to be included in the documentation output. This method influences whether inherited members are documented or not. The `AttributeDocumenter` class is also relevant, particularly its `import_object` and `get_doc` methods, as they deal with how attributes are documented and inherited. These code spans align with the expected behavior described in the issue, where inherited attributes should be documented correctly.",
