The issue is that an attribute annotated only in the superclass is being treated as 'undocumented' when the subclass is documented. To address this, we need to focus on how autodoc processes inherited members and annotations.\n\nFrom the search results, we identified several relevant code spans:\n1. In 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py', the 'ClassDocumenter' class and its methods 'get_object_members' and 'get_doc' are crucial for understanding how members of a class are documented and inherited. This includes the logic for including members based on options like 'inherited_members'.\n2. Also in the same file, the 'AttributeDocumenter' class and its method 'get_doc' are relevant, particularly how it handles annotations and documentation for attributes.\n3. In 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py', the '_getannotations' function (which is deprecated) might still be indirectly relevant for understanding how annotations are grabbed initially. However, it does not seem directly actionable given its deprecation status.\n\nBased on these spans, it appears the issue may lie in how 'ClassDocumenter' processes inherited members and whether annotations from superclasses are being properly honored. The 'AttributeDocumenter' likely plays a role in how annotations are interpreted and presented, but the primary concern for this specific issue seems to be in 'ClassDocumenter'.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis of these code spans, I will identify the relevant spans and files accordingly.",

The `get_object_members` method in `ClassDocumenter` is responsible for determining which members (including inherited ones) are documented, and it seems to filter based on whether members are directly defined in the class or inherited. This filtering logic might not correctly identify inherited members with annotations as needing documentation unless explicitly marked or included through options like 'all' or 'inherited-members'. Additionally, the `get_doc` method in `AttributeDocumenter` specifically attempts to handle docstrings, and its behavior when dealing with inherited attributes could be the root cause if it's not treating inherited attributes as expected.

The current context shows the relevant code spans in the sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py file, including methods like merge_members_option, get_object_members, and get_doc from the ClassDocumenter and AttributeDocumenter classes. These methods deal with options for members, retrieving object members, and getting documentation for attributes. The new search results also include the ClassDocumenter and AttributeDocumenter classes with their relevant methods. The ClassDocumenter's get_object_members method is crucial as it handles the exclusion of members not listed in options.members and filtering based on whether members are inherited. The AttributeDocumenter's get_doc method also plays a role in handling the documentation of attributes. These methods need to be inspected for how they handle undocumented members, especially those inherited with only type annotations. It appears that the get_object_members method may not be considering all inherited members when 'inherited-members' is set, and the AttributeDocumenter's get_doc may not be correctly processing the docstrings of inherited attributes that only have type annotations.
