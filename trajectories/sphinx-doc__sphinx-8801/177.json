This suggests that the logic in `autodoc` might not be correctly handling inherited members or their annotations. The main classes to focus on are `ClassDocumenter`, `AttributeDocumenter`, and potentially `DocstringSignatureMixin` since they deal with class-level documentation and attribute handling. Additionally, the `importer.py` file is relevant as it contains functions related to getting class members and their attributes. Directives and options handling in `directive.py` might also be relevant as they dictate how to process inherited members and undocumented attributes.",

This problem can be localized to how members are filtered and documented in the `ClassDocumenter` and `Documenter` classes. The key function `filter_members` in `Documenter` class contains logic that controls whether inherited members are included based on options like `inherited_members` and `undoc_members`. Additionally, the `get_class_members` method in the `importer.py` file plays a crucial role in collecting members, including those that are only present in the superclass's annotations. Therefore, examining these spans would be critical to address the issue. The `ClassDocumenter` class, specifically its `get_object_members` and `document_members` methods, will need to be reviewed to understand how inherited members are processed and documented.",

Additionally, the `get_class_members` function in the `importer.py` file is crucial as it retrieves and processes members of a class, including those that are inherited. These components suggest that the relevant code for addressing the issue of inherited members being treated as 'undocumented' is present in the file context.",
