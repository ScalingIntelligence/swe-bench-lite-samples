This affects the documentation of subclasses that inherit such attributes. The relevant files identified so far include those from sphinx.ext.autodoc, which handle the documentation process, and sphinx.ext.napoleon for handling docstrings. To address this, we need to focus on the logic within these files that determines how inherited attributes are documented.",

This behavior is evident in the scenario where the subclass Bar inherits the attribute attr1 from the superclass Foo but doesn't document it unless the ':undoc-members:' option is explicitly given. The search results provide several relevant spans of code from the sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py file, particularly in the Documenter, ClassDocumenter, and AttributeDocumenter classes. These sections handle the documentation of members, the processing of inherited members, and the filtering of members based on the presence of docstrings or annotations. Notably, spans such as 'Documenter.filter_members', 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members', and 'AttributeDocumenter.can_document_member' are relevant as they deal directly with how members from superclasses are treated and documented. The importer.py file also contains a relevant span 'get_object_members' which is responsible for fetching members of an object, which can include inherited members. However, a thorough review of the entire sections (not just isolated spans) reveals that the current logic might miss annotating inherited members correctly, which could explain the reported behavior. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant and should help address the issue by potentially adjusting how inherited members are documented or filtered.",
