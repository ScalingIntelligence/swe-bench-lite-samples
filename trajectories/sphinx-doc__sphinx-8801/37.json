This problem can be traced to how autodoc processes inherited members and their attributes. The key areas to focus on are the methods related to member filtering, documentation retrieval, and signature formatting within the autodoc module. Specifically, the `ClassDocumenter` class and its associated mixins might contain the logic responsible for handling inherited attributes. Additionally, the `AttributeDocumenter` class should be inspected as it deals with attribute documentation.",

This problem is likely occurring in the documentation generation process where inherited members are not being properly documented. The key functions to focus on are those related to fetching and filtering members and adding content, especially where inherited members are involved. In the provided code spans, the relevant methods are `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members`, `Documenter.filter_members`, and `Documenter.add_content`. These methods deal directly with the inherited members and content documentation. Specifically, `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` should be checked for how it handles inherited members, and `Documenter.filter_members` for its logic around including or excluding inherited members. Additionally, `Documenter.add_content` will be crucial to inspect how it processes or decides to add content for members, including those from superclasses. These methods are pivotal to resolving the issue as they control the inclusion and documentation of members from inherited classes.",

The method checks various conditions to decide whether a member should be documented, including whether the member is inherited and whether it has a docstring. The `ClassDocumenter` class, which inherits from `Documenter`, is also relevant as it handles class-specific documentation. The provided search results confirm the relevance of the `ClassDocumenter` class and its methods, particularly `get_object_members`, which is responsible for collecting members of the class.

The provided search results and file context show several key areas in the autodoc extension's codebase that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **ObjectMember Class**: This class is used to represent members of an object with additional metadata. The `__init__` method of this class initializes the `docstring`, `class_`, and `skipped` attributes, all of which are crucial for identifying and documenting inherited members.\n\n2. **Documenter Class**: The base class for all documenters. Its `filter_members` method is the most relevant as it determines which members to document based on various options like `inherited-members` and `undoc-members`.\n\n3. **ClassDocumenter Class**: Specifically handles documenting classes. Its `get_object_members` and `filter_members` methods are crucial for processing and filtering members to be documented, including inherited ones.\n\n4. **ModuleDocumenter Class**: Handles modules, but its `get_object_members` method is pertinent for understanding how members are retrieved in the context of modules and potentially influencing how inherited members are treated.\n\nThese sections of code are central to how autodoc processes and documents members, particularly in the context of inheritance. Analyzing these segments would help in identifying why annotated-only members in superclasses might be treated as undocumented and how to rectify it.\n\nFrom the provided code, it's clear that the `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class and the similar methods in derived classes like `ClassDocumenter` would need to be scrutinized for any logic that might inadvertently filter out or overlook annotated-only inherited members.",

Further examination of the `__init__` and `get_object_members` methods in `ClassDocumenter` should ensure all pathways for handling inherited members are covered.
