This is evident from the example provided where `Bar.attr1` from the `Foo` class is not being documented when it should be. The relevant code spans in the provided context and search results revolve around the `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` classes, particularly their methods for handling inherited members (`get_object_members`, `get_doc`, and `add_directive_header`). These methods are crucial for determining how members from superclasses are treated and documented within subclasses.
