The `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` classes are instrumental here. `ClassDocumenter` processes class members, including inherited ones, and decides which to document, while `AttributeDocumenter` focuses on individual attributes. The key methods `get_object_members` in `ClassDocumenter` and `get_doc` in both `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` are analyzed. `get_object_members` determines if and which inherited members to document, and `get_doc` retrieves the docstrings for both classes and attributes. The issue suggests that the attribute from the superclass, `Bar.attr1`, is treated as undocumented, and further inspection shows that this might be due to missing handling in `get_doc` for annotations of inherited members. This discrepancy needs further configuration or code adjustments to correctly handle such scenarios.",
