The main concern is that an attribute from the superclass is being treated as 'undocumented' when generating documentation for the subclass. The problem can be traced to how the autodoc extension handles inherited members and their documentation status. Potential areas of investigation include the methods related to filtering and formatting members, especially those in the ClassDocumenter and AttributeDocumenter classes. Also, examining how the docstring and annotations are processed in these contexts could be insightful.",

This indicates a need to review the ClassDocumenter and AttributeDocumenter classes in the autodoc module, as they are responsible for documenting classes and their attributes, respectively. I will focus on identifying code spans related to the retrieval and documentation of attributes in subclasses, particularly where annotations are handled. The search results contain multiple relevant spans, including methods like get_object_members, get_doc, add_directive_header, and more, which are central to the issue described. These methods involve the logic for how members (and their annotations) are fetched and presented, aligning well with the bug report. I will select these spans as relevant to the reported issue.",
