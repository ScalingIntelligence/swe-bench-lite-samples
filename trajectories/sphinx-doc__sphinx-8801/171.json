The problem is that annotated members from superclasses are being treated as 'undocumented', leading to them not being shown in the documentation unless the ':undoc-members:' option is explicitly provided. The expected behavior is that these inherited members should be documented by default. Given the issue, it's important to focus on the autodoc extension and its handling of class-level and attribute documentation. The relevant files and functions to investigate include the ClassDocumenter and AttributeDocumenter classes in the __init__.py file of the autodoc extension, particularly methods like get_object_members, get_doc, and add_content, which are critical for determining how members are documented. Additionally, the importer.py file's _getmro and _getannotations functions might be relevant for understanding how superclass attributes are being processed and inherited.",

The provided code spans from `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` reveal several key components: 1. The `ClassDocumenter` class, which is responsible for documenting classes, includes methods like `get_object_members` and `get_doc` that handle member retrieval and documentation string processing. 2. The `AttributeDocumenter` class, which handles the documentation of attributes, has methods such as `get_doc` and `add_content`. Analyzing the `get_doc` method of `ClassDocumenter` shows how it retrieves and processes docstrings, including from the `__init__` and `__new__` methods. Looking at `AttributeDocumenter.get_doc`, it handles comments and docstrings for attributes specifically. Reviewing `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py`, there are deprecated functions related to type hint retrieval that might not be directly relevant but could indicate a need for refactoring in related areas. Overall, the identified code spans are relevant to the issue of handling inherited members and their documentation as they address aspects related to member retrieval, docstring processing, and attribute documentation specific to classes and attributes. These encompass the major functionalities needed for documenting inherited attributes correctly and determining their documentation status.",
