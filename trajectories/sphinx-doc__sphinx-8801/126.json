This behavior is demonstrated with an example where `Bar.attr1` from class `Bar` inheriting from `Foo` is not documented despite being present. The expected behavior is that these inhertied attributes should be documented.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code, the most relevant spans are those within `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter`. Within `ClassDocumenter`, the method `get_object_members` is particularly relevant as it controls which members of a class are considered for documentation, including inherited ones. The logic within this method determines whether to include inherited members based on the `inherited_members` option.\n\nIn the `AttributeDocumenter` class, the `update_annotations` method is crucial. This method ensures that annotations from all parent classes are considered, which directly addresses the issue of documenting inherited attributes. Furthermore, the `import_object` method in `AttributeDocumenter` ensures that annotations are updated for the parent class which is essential for including inherited members in the documentation process.\n\nThe span labeled `get_class_members` in `importer.py` is also relevant as it collects members of a class, including those inherited, which is directly linked to the problem of documenting inherited attributes.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans within `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` are the most relevant and should be considered key to addressing the reported issue.",
