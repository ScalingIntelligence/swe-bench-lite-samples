'ClassDocumenter' and its '__init__' method which initializes the class documenter and merges members options, suggesting it handles the docstring and member inclusion logic. 2. 'AttributeDocumenter' which is responsible for documenting attributes, including those with annotations. 3. The 'setup' function which initializes various autodoc handlers including 'ClassDocumenter' and 'AttributeDocumenter', suggesting a broad configuration point where member handling options might be set. These spans are relevant as they touch upon the handling of class members and attribute documentation, which is central to the reported issue. They also provide context on the mechanisms used to include or exclude members based on their documentation status and class hierarchy. By analyzing these spans, we can understand how inherited members, particularly those with only annotations, are managed in the documentation process.",

This means that attributes like `attr1` in the `Foo` class are not being documented when `Bar` is documented, even though `Bar` inherits from `Foo`. This issue is likely related to how autodoc processes inherited members and annotations. By examining the provided search results, I can see several relevant classes and methods that handle member options and documenter setup. Specifically, the `ClassDocumenter` class and its `__init__` method, which calls `merge_members_option`, seem relevant as they deal with class documentation and options. Additionally, the `AttributeDocumenter` class and its mixins are likely involved in documenting class attributes, which include type annotations. The `setup` function, which registers various documenters, also seems relevant as it includes `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter`. However, the search results don't directly point to the exact code responsible for handling inherited members' annotations. More analysis might be needed to pinpoint the specific code dealing with inherited annotations.",
