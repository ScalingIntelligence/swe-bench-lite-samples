            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the handling of inherited members in the autodoc extension of Sphinx. Specifically, the problem is that an annotation-only member in a superclass is being treated as 'undocumented' when generating documentation for a subclass. This suggests that the relevant code spans would likely involve methods responsible for determining which members to document, particularly those handling inherited members.\n\nGiven the context and the issue description, the key areas to focus on are methods related to fetching and evaluating members. The code spans identified as relevant include 'Documenter.get_object_members', 'ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members', and 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members'. These methods are directly responsible for determining which members to include in the documentation and how they are evaluated. The 'Documenter.get_object_members' method may have a broader implementation applicable to many types of documenters, whereas 'ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members' and 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members' specialize this behavior for modules and classes respectively. The issue mentioned about inherited members in subclasses indicates that this functionality might not be correctly implemented or there might be missing conditions to include inherited members, especially those that are only annotated.\n\nThe 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members' seems particularly relevant, as this class is likely to handle instances where members are inherited. This method determines which class members to document based on options like 'inherited_members'. If 'inherited_members' is specified, it would need to ensure that all members, including those from inherited classes, are evaluated for documentation, which may be where the current implementation is failing or excluding annotated members. The analysis of the code in these spans could lead to identifying the exact condition or logic required to correctly include or exclude members based on their documentation state.",
