The user's example demonstrated how the `attr1` attribute from the `Foo` class is not being documented when `Bar` is processed by autodoc, unless the `:undoc-members:` option is explicitly provided. This suggests a problem in how autodoc handles inherited attributes, particularly those with only type annotations. The provided search results show relevant sections of the code in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. Specifically, the `ClassDocumenter` class method `get_object_members` seems crucial as it filters the members of a class, including handling inherited members based on the options provided (e.g., whether inherited members are to be included). Additionally, the `AttributeDocumenter` class and its `update_annotations` method are also relevant, as they deal with annotation handling, which could be related to the issue of attributes being seen as undocumented.",

Despite the absence of direct calls or mentions of attr1 in the context, these methods suggest areas relevant to inherited attribute documentation.
