The attribute from the superclass is being treated as 'undocumented' and not showing up, even with the :inherited-members: directive. This suggests that the issue might be in how autodoc identifies and processes members, particularly inherited ones. The relevant file to investigate is likely sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py, as it contains the implementation for ClassDocumenter and its related methods for handling class members. Additionally, the documentation examples in doc/usage/extensions/* might be relevant for understanding how autodoc is being used.",

The main concern is that when using the 'autoclass' directive with ':inherited-members:', the attributes from the superclass (like `attr1` in `Foo`) are not documented for the subclass (`Bar`). I reviewed the current file context and identified `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` as the relevant file containing key functions like `Documenter.filter_members` and `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members`. The new search results provided additional context for these functions, which are crucial for determining the behavior of inherited members documentation.\n\nIn the `Documenter.filter_members` function, the logic checks if a member is from a specified superclass and decides whether to include it. The issue might arise from how the function processes annotations or docstrings from superclasses. Additionally, `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` directs the retrieval of member objects for classes, which is essential for this issue since it involves documenting class members, especially inherited ones.\n\nGiven the complexity of the code and the reported issue, focusing on these spans will help to address the bug where annotation-only members in superclasses are treated as undocumented.",

These methods are crucial for handling inherited members and filtering them based on documentation status. The logic in is_filtered_inherited_member seems to address the issue of filtering inherited members, including those that are only annotated. Given the detailed examination of these methods and their interaction with inherited members, it appears that the file context is sufficiently relevant to address the reported issue.",
