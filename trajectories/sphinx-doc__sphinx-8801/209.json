This issue is pertinent to the ClassDocumenter and AttributeDocumenter classes within the sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py file. The analysis of the search results shows that the ClassDocumenter class is responsible for documenting classes and their members, and it includes methods such as `import_object`, `get_doc`, and `document_members` that are crucial for the documentation process, including handling inherited members. The AttributeDocumenter class is also relevant as it pertains to documenting class attributes, which could include attributes inherited from a superclass. The `merge_members_option` function likely influences how members are processed, potentially affecting whether undocumented members are shown. The search results from sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py do not directly contribute to the solution of the reported issue and are therefore not included in the identified spans.
