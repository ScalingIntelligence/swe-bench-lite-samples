The specific problem is that `Bar.attr1` from the class `Bar` which inherits from `Foo` is not documented correctly. This suggests that the issue might be related to how autodoc processes inherited members or annotations. The most relevant files seem to be those dealing with the autodoc extension itself, particularly those handling class documentation and attribute handling. Therefore, the initial search should focus on these areas.",

The primary focus appears to be on ensuring that attributes inherited from superclasses, particularly those with type annotations, are properly documented when using the autodoc extension in Sphinx. \n\nThe search results provided contain several relevant spans of code that deal with how members are retrieved and documented for classes. Notable are the methods get_object_members, filter_members, and the overall handling of inherited members in the ClassDocumenter. These sections directly address the logic for determining which members to document and how to handle inherited members. Notably, the logic in ClassDocumenter.get_object_members and Documenter.filter_members seem pivotal for the case in question, as they determine the members to be included in the documentation and how to filter inherited members respectively. Further analysis in filter_members, specifically the function is_filtered_inherited_member, shows a direct relevance in checking inherited members against the superclass. This function could be key in understanding why annotated members might be missed.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans of code answer the reported issue effectively, providing insights into how autodoc retrieves and filters members, including those inherited from superclasses, and how annotations are handled.",
