We also need to consider the methods responsible for filtering and processing members, which might be found in the `Documenter` class or its subclasses. The key methods to look for are `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, and possibly `add_directive_header`.",

Analyzing the search results, it's clear that the core logic of how autodoc processes and filters members is in the 'filter_members' method within the Documenter class. This method includes logic to determine whether a member is skipped based on documentation presence and the 'undoc_members' option. It also has specific handling for inherited members, which is directly relevant to the issue. Additionally, there's a ClassDocumenter class extending Documenter, which could also potentially handle inherited members differently. The '__init__' and 'get_object_members' methods in ClassDocumenter show setup and member retrieval logic that could influence how inherited members are treated, which is also pertinent. Overall, the vast majority of the relevant code spans are found within the 'filter_members' method in the Documenter class and pertinent setups and retrievals in the ClassDocumenter class.",
