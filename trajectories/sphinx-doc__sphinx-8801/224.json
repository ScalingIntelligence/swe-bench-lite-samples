This suggests that the system is not correctly inheriting or recognizing the annotations from the superclass. After analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are found primarily in the 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' file. The 'ClassDocumenter' class is responsible for documenting classes and their members. It includes methods such as 'get_object_members' which retrieves class members and 'get_doc' which retrieves documentation for the class. Additionally, the 'AttributeDocumenter' class is relevant for handling attributes, including type annotations. The 'get_doc' method in 'AttributeDocumenter' is particularly important as it retrieves documentation comments for attributes, which might be where the issue lies if the inheritance process is not correctly handled. The '_getannotations' function in 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py' is also noteworthy as it deals with annotations themselves.
