The focus should be on how autodoc processes class inheritance and member documentation. The relevant files and methods to investigate include those in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` directory, particularly `__init__.py`, where various Documenter classes and their methods for handling class and attribute documentation are located. The issue suggests that the annotation-only members are being treated as undocumented, which may involve the `get_object_members`, `get_doc`, and `filter_members` methods in the `ClassDocumenter` class. Additionally, the `importer.py` file contains functions related to importing and inspecting class members, which might also be relevant.",

This problem seems to be linked to how Sphinx handles member documentation, specifically in the 'autodoc' extension. The key areas of the codebase to look into would therefore be methods related to member documentation, filtering, and inheritance handling within the 'autodoc' module. By analyzing the provided 'autodoc' code, the methods 'Documenter.get_object_members', 'Documenter.filter_members', 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members', 'AttributeDocumenter.get_attribute_comment', and 'AttributeDocumenter.get_doc' appear most relevant. These methods deal with fetching, filtering, and documenting members of objects, which is directly related to the issue of members being treated as 'undocumented'. Furthermore, the 'AttributeDocumenter' class's methods handle attribute-specific documentation issues that might explain the problem reported in the issue. The method 'AttributeDocumenter.can_document_member' may be crucial in understanding if the annotations are being treated differently. The search results also include utility functions '_getmro' and '_getannotations' which might offer more insight into how Sphinx retrieves inherited attributes and annotations. The method 'Documenter.filter_members' could be critical in determining why 'Bar.attr1' in the example isn't being documented, as it filters members and checks whether they are documented or not based on options like 'undoc_members'.",
