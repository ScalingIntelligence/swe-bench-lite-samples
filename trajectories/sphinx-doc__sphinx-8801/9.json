Specifically, it indicates that such members are being treated as 'undocumented'. To address this, it's crucial to review the code related to how autodoc processes class and attribute documentation, especially concerning inherited members and their annotations.\n\nThe initial analysis of the search results reveals several relevant code spans. The `ClassDocumenter` class in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and the `get_class_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` are particularly pertinent. These sections handle the retrieval of class members, including inherited members, and process annotations. The `AttributeDocumenter` class in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` is also relevant as it deals with attribute documentation, which includes handling annotations.\n\nBy examining these code spans, we can identify the logic that controls how inherited members are treated and how annotations are processed. This should help in understanding why annotation-only members in superclasses are being marked as 'undocumented'. On reviewing the entire sections, it becomes clear that the identified spans are relevant and sufficient to address the reported issue, as they cover the necessary logic related to class and attribute documentation, inherited members, and annotations.",
