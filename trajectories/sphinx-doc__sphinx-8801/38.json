Specifically, the issue is that the `attr1` attribute from the superclass `Foo` is not being documented when the subclass `Bar` is documented, unless the `:undoc-members:` option is explicitly used. This suggests an issue with how autodoc is processing inherited members. The search results contain several relevant code spans within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module, particularly in the `ClassDocumenter` and `AttributeDocumenter` classes. These spans include methods like `get_object_members`, `get_doc`, and `add_content`, which are directly involved in determining which members to document and how to extract and process their documentation. The code analysis indicates that the problem likely lies in the logic that decides whether to include inherited members in the documentation and how to handle their docstrings or annotations.

The 'get_object_members' method seems to control which members are included in the documentation based on options like 'inherited-members'. The 'get_doc' method is crucial for retrieving and preparing the docstrings for these members.
