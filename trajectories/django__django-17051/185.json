This would allow for the retrieval of IDs after an upsert operation, which is currently not supported. The relevant files and methods include those in `django/db/models/query.py` where `bulk_create` and related methods are defined, `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` for SQL compilation, and `django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py` for PostgreSQL-specific database operations, especially those related to conflict handling and SQL generation.

The key focus is on ensuring that primary keys are set in the returned queryset under such conditions, which is currently not happening due to the omission of the RETURNING clause in the SQL query. By examining the relevant code spans, I have identified that modifications need to be made in the handling of the bulk_create method within the QuerySet class and the corresponding SQLInsertCompiler class. The issue points to a specific part in Django source where returning_fields are removed which implies the need to review and possibly adjust the logic surrounding the on_conflict_suffix_sql method in the DatabaseOperations class to include RETURNING clause for update_conflicts scenarios. Additionally, the SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql method should be scrutinized to ensure it can handle the returned IDs appropriately. Further, the QuerySet.bulk_create method itself should be adapted to account for the possibility of ID returns when update_conflicts is true, ensuring the IDs are set in the objects passed to it.",

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
