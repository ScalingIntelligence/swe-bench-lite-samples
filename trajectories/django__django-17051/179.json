The primary problem is that the method does not return IDs in the queryset when handling update conflicts, even though the PostgreSQL query supports the RETURNING clause. This discrepancy needs to be addressed to enhance the bulk upsert feature. Relevant files include `django/db/models/query.py`, which contains the implementation of `bulk_create`, and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which might involve SQL compilation related to this. Additionally, `django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py` could be relevant due to its specific handling in PostgreSQL.",

This involves understanding why the RETURNING clause is not included in the SQL query generated by Django for bulk_create with update_conflicts, and how to modify this behavior to return the IDs. The search results have provided relevant code spans from Django's source code, specifically within the SQLInsertCompiler class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, where the `execute_sql` method determines whether to return fields after an insert operation. Additionally, the `DatabaseOperations` class in `django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py` includes the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method, which constructs the SQL suffix for conflict handling, indicating where the RETURNING clause could potentially be added for update_conflicts. These spans of code are directly related to the processing of bulk_create operations and conflict handling, making them highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

The `SQLInsertCompiler` class in `compiler.py` manages the `returning_fields` attribute, which is critical for this issue, but it currently does not conditionally include these fields when handling updates (only handles them during insert). In `operations.py`, the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method constructs the SQL for conflict handling, indicating the potential location to modify or extend for returning IDs during updates. Although the exact line in Django source code that removes `returning_fields` during update conflicts is not shown, the provided context sufficiently indicates where modifications might be needed.

  "initial_message": "Allow returning IDs in QuerySet.bulk_create() when updating conflicts.\nDescription\n\t\nCurrently, when using bulk_create with a conflict handling flag turned on (e.g. ignore_conflicts or update_conflicts), the primary keys are not set in the returned queryset, as documented in bulk_create.\nWhile I understand using ignore_conflicts can lead to PostgreSQL not returning the IDs when a row is ignored (see \u200bthis SO thread), I don't understand why we don't return the IDs in the case of update_conflicts.\nFor instance:\nMyModel.objects.bulk_create([MyModel(...)], update_conflicts=True, update_fields=[...], unique_fields=[...])\ngenerates a query without a RETURNING my_model.id part:\nINSERT INTO \"my_model\" (...)\nVALUES (...)\n\tON CONFLICT(...) DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
