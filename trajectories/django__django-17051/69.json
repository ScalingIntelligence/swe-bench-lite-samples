This enhancement would make `bulk_create` more useful as a bulk upsert feature. To address this, we need to identify the parts of the Django source code responsible for the SQL generation and execution during bulk insert operations, particularly focusing on the handling of the `returning_fields` attribute in the `SQLInsertCompiler` class. The provided search results include the `SQLInsertCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which contains the `execute_sql` method where the `returning_fields` attribute is processed. Additionally, there is a method in `django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py` that constructs the SQL suffix for conflict handling, relevant to the `update_conflicts` scenario. These two sections of the code are directly related to the functionality mentioned in the issue and should be considered for potential modifications to allow the returning of IDs in the case of update conflicts.",

  "initial_message": "Allow returning IDs in QuerySet.bulk_create() when updating conflicts.\nDescription\n\t\nCurrently, when using bulk_create with a conflict handling flag turned on (e.g. ignore_conflicts or update_conflicts), the primary keys are not set in the returned queryset, as documented in bulk_create.\nWhile I understand using ignore_conflicts can lead to PostgreSQL not returning the IDs when a row is ignored (see \u200bthis SO thread), I don't understand why we don't return the IDs in the case of update_conflicts.\nFor instance:\nMyModel.objects.bulk_create([MyModel(...)], update_conflicts=True, update_fields=[...], unique_fields=[...])\ngenerates a query without a RETURNING my_model.id part:\nINSERT INTO \"my_model\" (...)\nVALUES (...)\n\tON CONFLICT(...) DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
