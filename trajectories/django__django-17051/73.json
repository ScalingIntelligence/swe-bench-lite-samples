I need to find the relevant code spans in the search results that deal with the implementation of bulk_create and how it handles conflict resolution. In the 'QuerySet.bulk_create' span, there is code that checks for conflict handling options and prepares the objects for bulk creation. This is directly related to the issue as it discusses how bulk_create handles conflicts. Additionally, in the 'DatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql' span, there is code that constructs the ON CONFLICT SQL clause, which is essential for understanding how the conflict resolution is currently implemented and how it could be modified to include the RETURNING clause when update_conflicts is True.

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
