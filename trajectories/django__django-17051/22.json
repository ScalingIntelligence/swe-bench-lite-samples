This issue involves modifying the behavior of `bulk_create` to include 'RETURNING my_model.id' in the SQL query for conflict updates. The search results contain relevant code spans in the `QuerySet.bulk_create` method, particularly where the `on_conflict` parameter is handled and the SQL query is constructed. Additionally, there are spans in other files like `compiler.py` and various database backend operations files that handle SQL compilation and conflict resolution. These spans are relevant to understand how `bulk_create` integrates with SQL generation and database-specific operations. Specifically, the absence of 'RETURNING' clauses in the `execute_sql` methods of `SQLInsertCompiler` and related classes is notable, as this appears to be where the primary key returns might be handled if implemented.",

The QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py includes the bulk_create method which is central to the reported issue since it handles the creation of multiple objects in bulk, including conditions for conflict handling with parameters like update_conflicts. It also references the _batched_insert method which is crucial for understanding how batches of objects are inserted and how conflict handling is applied. Additionally, the SQLInsertCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py is relevant as it might influence how the RETURNING clause is handled in SQL statements, though it's not directly shown in the code snippet how this is managed in the context of update_conflicts. The DatabaseOperations classes for PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL in their respective operations.py files are also pertinent as they define how SQL for conflict handling is constructed, including for update conflicts. This broad coverage of classes and methods related to the bulk_create functionality and SQL compilation suggests that the developer has a clear path to identify and perhaps modify where the RETURNING clause is omitted in the case of update_conflicts. Therefore, I believe the relevant file context has been provided to address the issue and progress with the development task.",

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
