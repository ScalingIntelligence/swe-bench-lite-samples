The main focus is on modifying the `bulk_create` method to include a `RETURNING` clause in the SQL query issued to the database, specifically for the PostgreSQL backend. This would help in retrieving the IDs of the inserted or updated records during a bulk upsert operation.\n\nUpon analyzing the provided search results, several key points emerged:\n\n1. **QuerySet.bulk_create**: The method is defined in `django/db/models/query.py`. It handles the bulk creation of objects, including conflict handling via `ignore_conflicts` and `update_conflicts` flags. Currently, the method does not append a `RETURNING` clause, which is crucial for returning IDs.\n\n2. **Database Backend Operations**: The `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method in the various database backend operations files (`postgresql`, `mysql`, `sqlite3`) builds the SQL suffix for conflict handling. For PostgreSQL, the existing method includes `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` but lacks the `RETURNING` clause. This is where the enhancement should be implemented.\n\n3. **Relevant Code Spans**: The identified spans include the entire `bulk_create` method in `QuerySet` and the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` methods in the PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite backends. These sections are directly involved in the logic affected by the issue and have potential points for including the `RETURNING` clause.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans needed to address the issue are in the `bulk_create` method of `QuerySet` and the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` methods in the database-specific backend operations.",

It also includes django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py, which deals with database-specific operations, including conflict handling for PostgreSQL. This context seems relevant to the issue, as it covers aspects of both the generic bulk_create functionality and PostgreSQL-specific conflict handling. However, the current implementation in the bulk_create method does not clearly handle returning_fields when update_conflicts is true, indicating a potential gap in the existing functionality that aligns with the reported issue.

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
