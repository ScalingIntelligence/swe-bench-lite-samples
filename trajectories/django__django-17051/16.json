This involves changes in the `QuerySet.bulk_create` method within `django/db/models/query.py` and the `SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. Specifically, the issue is related to the removal of `returning_fields` under certain conditions in the `bulk_create` method, which should be modified to include the `RETURNING my_model.id` clause when `update_conflicts=True`. This would effectively treat `bulk_create` as a bulk upsert feature and return the IDs of updated records.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans identified are:\n1. `QuerySet.bulk_create` in `django/db/models/query.py` which currently handles the bulk creation of objects with conflict handling options.\n2. `SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` which executes the SQL for insert operations, currently missing the handling for returning fields in case of conflicts.\n\nThis analysis suggests that modifications to these methods are necessary to implement the desired behavior, specifically by adding the `RETURNING` clause when `update_conflicts=True` in the `bulk_create` method, and ensuring that `SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql` properly handles and returns these fields. Furthermore, the database-specific operations in `django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py` and others might need corresponding adjustments to support the `RETURNING` clause appropriately.",

Both the file contexts and the provided search results contain code spans that are highly relevant to the issue. In the 'django/db/models/query.py' file, the 'QuerySet.bulk_create' method is critical as it directly handles the bulk creation of objects, including management of conflicts. Examining this method, it is clear that it sets up how conflicts are handled, manages object states, and controls the fields used in update operations. Moreover, the method '_batched_insert' appears to be involved in the SQL execution and managing returned columns. In the 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' file, the 'SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql' method is also pertinent, as it deals with SQL execution, managing returned rows during insertion, and handling the 'returning_fields', which likely includes the primary keys. This method's handling of 'returning_fields' appears to impact the successful identification of IDs in conflict contexts. Based on this analysis, I have identified these two methods as key to addressing the issue, and as such, they should be considered as part of the solution to improve ID handling during bulk creation with conflict updates.",

The user points out that currently, when using bulk_create with conflict handling flags like update_conflicts, the primary keys are not set in the returned queryset. The user suggests that by appending the RETURNING clause, the ID can be returned (verified with PostgreSQL). The user also mentions investigating the Django source where the returning_fields get removed. The objective is to discriminate the cases differently to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts for a bulk upsert feature.\n\nThe provided context includes sections from two files: django/db/models/query.py and django/db/models/sql/compiler.py. The QuerySet.bulk_create method in query.py is observed to handle bulk creation with options for conflict handling, but it does not explicitly handle the RETURNING clause for returning IDs in the case of update_conflicts. The SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql method in compiler.py handles SQL execution for insert operations and manages the returning_fields, but it also does not specifically address the need for returning IDs in the case of update conflicts.\n\nThe new search results include additional sections of the SQLInsertCompiler class, specifically focusing on the execute_sql method. This method is crucial as it directly deals with SQL execution and returning results. The execute_sql method currently checks for capabilities to return rows from bulk insert but does not specifically incorporate the RETURNING clause based on the update_conflicts flag.\n\nBased on the issue and the provided code context, it is clear that the relevant code spans are primarily located in the execute_sql method of the SQLInsertCompiler class. The task is to modify this method to conditionally use the RETURNING clause when update_conflicts is True, which is currently not explicitly handled.

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
