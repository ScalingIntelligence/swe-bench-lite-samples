            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the handling of primary keys when using `bulk_create` with conflict handling flags such as `ignore_conflicts` or `update_conflicts`. The primary concern is that the primary keys are not being set in the returned queryset in the case of `update_conflicts`. This is evidenced by the lack of a 'RETURNING my_model.id' clause in the generated SQL query when using `bulk_create` with `update_conflicts` enabled. This behavior is problematic because it prevents the efficient use of `bulk_create` as a bulk upsert feature.\n\nThe analysis of the provided search results reveals several relevant code spans associated with the handling of bulk creation and conflict resolution in the Django ORM. Specifically, the `QuerySet.bulk_create` method in `django/db/models/query.py` is central to this functionality. This method includes logic to handle different conflict scenarios, such as `ignore_conflicts` and `update_conflicts`, but does not currently include a 'RETURNING' clause to fetch primary keys in the case of `update_conflicts`. This omission aligns with the user's issue description and suggests that modifications to this method could resolve the reported problem.\n\nAdditionally, the `DatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql` methods across various database backend files (`postgresql`, `sqlite3`, `mysql`) are also relevant, as they dictate how the SQL suffix for conflict handling is constructed. These methods support the generation of 'ON CONFLICT' clauses specific to each database type, but do not currently factor in returning primary key values. Enhancing these methods with the ability to include 'RETURNING' clauses where appropriate could provide the necessary functionality to address the user's request.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that the existing codebase has the necessary hooks and methods to potentially implement the requested functionality, but modifications and additions will be required to fully address the issue.",

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
