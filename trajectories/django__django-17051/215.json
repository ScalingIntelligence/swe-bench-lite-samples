The primary concern is that the method does not return the IDs of the created or updated objects, which is a limitation when using `bulk_create` as a bulk upsert feature. The issue seems to be rooted in the handling of the `returning_fields` parameter in the `bulk_create` method and possibly in the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method in the database backend operations. To address this, we should focus our search on the `bulk_create` method in `django/db/models/query.py` and the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method across different database backend operations files.",

The key request is to return the IDs in the case of `update_conflicts`. Analyzing the provided search results, especially the `QuerySet._insert` and `QuerySet._batched_insert` methods in `django/db/models/query.py`, shows where the logic for handling bulk inserts and potential conflicts resides. The `_insert` method already has a parameter for `returning_fields`, which suggests that the framework already has infrastructure for returning fields from an insert operation. Additionally, the `_batched_insert` method conditions the return of inserted rows based on the `bulk_return` feature and absence of `on_conflict`. The `on_conflict_suffix_sql` methods across different database operations files (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL) are also relevant as they define the SQL suffix for conflict handling. The `BaseDatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql` provides a baseline for unimplemented conflict handlers. These findings suggest that the current implementation partially supports returning fields after an insert operation, specifically when no conflict handling is specified. The next step would be modifying these methods to include returning the primary keys in the case of `update_conflicts`.",

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
