            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the enhancement of the `bulk_create` method in Django's QuerySet to include the returning of IDs when handling conflicts, specifically for the `update_conflicts` flag. The relevant code spans are primarily located in `django/db/models/query.py`, where the `QuerySet.bulk_create` method itself is defined, and in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which contains the `SQLInsertCompiler` class responsible for compiling SQL for insert operations. Notably, the `bulk_create` method already contains logic for handling conflicts and bulk operations, but it lacks the specific functionality to return IDs in the case of `update_conflicts`. This omission is highlighted in the issue, suggesting that the inclusion of a `RETURNING my_model.id` clause in the SQL statement could resolve the issue. \n\nThe focus should be on modifying the `QuerySet.bulk_create` and `SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql` methods to handle the returning of IDs in the SQL statement for `update_conflicts`. This would involve checking for the `update_conflicts` flag and modifying the SQL generation process to include the `RETURNING` clause when necessary. The analysis of the `django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py`, `django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py`, and `django/db/backends/mysql/operations.py` files show how different database backends handle conflict resolution in their own `on_conflict_suffix_sql` methods, emphasizing the need for a backend-agnostic solution that respects the database-specific implementations while adding the functionality to return IDs on conflict updates.",

  "initial_message": "Allow returning IDs in QuerySet.bulk_create() when updating conflicts.\nDescription\n\t\nCurrently, when using bulk_create with a conflict handling flag turned on (e.g. ignore_conflicts or update_conflicts), the primary keys are not set in the returned queryset, as documented in bulk_create.\nWhile I understand using ignore_conflicts can lead to PostgreSQL not returning the IDs when a row is ignored (see \u200bthis SO thread), I don't understand why we don't return the IDs in the case of update_conflicts.\nFor instance:\nMyModel.objects.bulk_create([MyModel(...)], update_conflicts=True, update_fields=[...], unique_fields=[...])\ngenerates a query without a RETURNING my_model.id part:\nINSERT INTO \"my_model\" (...)\nVALUES (...)\n\tON CONFLICT(...) DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
