The issue specifically mentions that the primary keys are not being returned when using `update_conflicts`, and it points out a relevant part in the Django source code. We are tasked with finding the code that manages the `returning_fields` in the context of `bulk_create`. In the search results, we have found the `bulk_create` method in `django/db/models/query.py`, which contains the logic for handling various conflict options, including `update_conflicts`. Additionally, there are relevant sections in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` that deal with SQL compilation and execution, particularly `SQLInsertCompiler` which handles the `RETURNING` clause for PostgreSQL. These sections appear to be the most relevant to the issue at hand, as they directly involve generating the SQL for bulk operations and interpreting the results from the database. These findings suggest that modifying the logic around how `returning_fields` are handled when `update_conflicts` is true could be the solution. Therefore, the code spans related to `QuerySet.bulk_create` in `query.py` and `SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql` in `compiler.py` are identified as relevant.",

This involves modifying the SQL query generated by `bulk_create` to include a `RETURNING` clause for the primary key. The current implementation in `QuerySet.bulk_create` does not include this clause when `update_conflicts` is set. The search results provide a deeper look into the PostgreSQL backend operations and the base operations, which are relevant to understanding how the `bulk_create` function interacts with the database. Specifically, the `DatabaseOperations.fetch_returned_insert_rows` and `DatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql` methods are directly related to handling the conflict resolution and fetching the results after an insert operation. The presence of these methods indicates where the logic for conflict handling and result fetching resides, which is crucial for implementing the desired feature. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to addressing the issue of returning IDs in case of update conflicts.",

Currently, the IDs are not returned in such cases. The investigation points to the removal of `returning_fields` in the Django source, particularly in the `SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql` method. The goal is to discriminate these cases to retain the `returning_fields` in the case of `update_conflicts`, enabling the support for bulk upserts. The analysis focuses on the relevant parts of the Django ORM to identify where changes are needed. Key locations include the `QuerySet.bulk_create` method, the `execute_sql` method in `SQLInsertCompiler`, and the method that handles conflict suffix SQL (`on_conflict_suffix_sql`) in `DatabaseOperations`. The search results reveal relevant code spans that need to be examined and possibly modified to address the issue. These spans include the `bulk_create` method, `execute_sql`, and `on_conflict_suffix_sql` methods. The analysis will help in determining whether the identified code spans are sufficient to address the issue or if more investigation is required.",

  "initial_message": "Allow returning IDs in QuerySet.bulk_create() when updating conflicts.\nDescription\n\t\nCurrently, when using bulk_create with a conflict handling flag turned on (e.g. ignore_conflicts or update_conflicts), the primary keys are not set in the returned queryset, as documented in bulk_create.\nWhile I understand using ignore_conflicts can lead to PostgreSQL not returning the IDs when a row is ignored (see \u200bthis SO thread), I don't understand why we don't return the IDs in the case of update_conflicts.\nFor instance:\nMyModel.objects.bulk_create([MyModel(...)], update_conflicts=True, update_fields=[...], unique_fields=[...])\ngenerates a query without a RETURNING my_model.id part:\nINSERT INTO \"my_model\" (...)\nVALUES (...)\n\tON CONFLICT(...) DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
