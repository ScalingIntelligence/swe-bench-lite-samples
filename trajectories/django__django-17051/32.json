The user points out that manually appending a RETURNING clause to the SQL query does return the IDs, suggesting that the current implementation is missing this feature.\n\nUpon examining the search results, the most relevant code spans are found in the `django/db/models/query.py` file, specifically within the `QuerySet.bulk_create` method. This method contains the logic for handling bulk creation with conflict options. The code block includes handling for `ignore_conflicts` and `update_conflicts`, but it does not currently include a RETURNING clause for the primary keys.\n\nGiven the context of the issue, the relevant code spans are those that define and implement the `bulk_create` method in the QuerySet class. Notably, the code identifies the handling of `objs_with_pk` and `objs_without_pk` but does not specify returning the primary keys in the case of update conflicts. This is the part of the code that should be modified to address the user's request.\n\nAdditionally, the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method in `django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py` is also relevant as it constructs the ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE part of the SQL query but does not include the RETURNING clause.

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
