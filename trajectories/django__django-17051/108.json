The primary concern is that the primary keys are not returned in the queryset when `update_conflicts=True`. The issue seems to be associated with how the `returning_fields` are handled in the `bulk_create` method and related SQL compiler components. Given the context, it's essential to focus on the `django/db/models/query.py` file where `bulk_create` is defined, and the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file where the SQL for insert operations is compiled. Additionally, the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method in `django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py` and similar files for other databases might also be relevant for understanding how conflict handling is implemented and potentially modified to include returning fields for updates.",

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
