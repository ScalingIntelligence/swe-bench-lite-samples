The primary concern is that the primary keys are not returned in the case of `update_conflicts`, which would be useful for a bulk upsert feature. The relevant code spans provided from `django/db/models/query.py` and others suggest that the logic for handling conflicts and the actual SQL generation might be spread across multiple files. To pinpoint the exact location where the `RETURNING` clause is potentially omitted, we need to focus on the `bulk_create` method and the related SQL generation within the PostgreSQL backend, especially looking for the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method which might discriminate cases differently. Therefore, a specific search for code related to `bulk_create` with `update_conflicts` and the SQL generation for PostgreSQL will be effective.",

This involves modifying the current behavior where the RETURNING clause is omitted in the SQL query generated by bulk_create. The search results show two relevant files: 'django/db/models/query.py' and 'django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py'. The 'django/db/models/query.py' file contains the implementation of the QuerySet class and its bulk_create method. This method is where the logic for handling the bulk creation of objects, including conflict handling, is defined. Notably, the _batched_insert method within bulk_create seems to be responsible for generating the SQL queries, but it currently doesn't include the RETURNING clause even when update_conflicts is True. The 'django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py' file contains the DatabaseOperations class, which has a method on_conflict_suffix_sql that generates the ON CONFLICT part of the SQL query. This method correctly constructs the ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE clause, but the RETURNING clause might need to be appended in the context of the bulk_create method. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are the bulk_create method in 'django/db/models/query.py' and the on_conflict_suffix_sql method in 'django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py'.",

DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n"
