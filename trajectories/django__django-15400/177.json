This pattern is used for several magic methods like __getattr__, __bytes__, __str__, __bool__, etc. This suggests that implementing __radd__ could follow a similar pattern by using `new_method_proxy`. However, since `new_method_proxy` relies on the presence of the method in the wrapped object, a direct application to `__radd__` as with `operator.radd` is not feasible because `operator.radd` does not exist. Instead, it might be necessary to manually define `__radd__` to handle the reverse addition operation specifically for SimpleLazyObject.
