This method is crucial for the class to support reflection addition operations. From the provided file context and search results, it's evident that SimpleLazyObject inherits from LazyObject, which itself does not implement __radd__. However, LazyObject provides a framework for proxy methods using new_method_proxy, which SimpleLazyObject does not utilize for __radd__. The search results confirm the presence of new_method_proxy and LazyObject's proxy methods but do not include an implementation or proxy for __radd__ in SimpleLazyObject. To address the issue, an implementation of __radd__ in SimpleLazyObject is needed. The minimal implementation suggested in the issue involves checking if the object is wrapped and then performing the addition operation with the wrapped object and the other operand.",

From the provided context and search results, it's evident that SimpleLazyObject is derived from LazyObject, and both classes make extensive use of the new_method_proxy function to delegate various dunder methods. These methods are defined using new_method_proxy to lazily set up the wrapped object using the _wrapped attribute, which is initially set to the 'empty' object. The missing __radd__ method in SimpleLazyObject can be easily added by defining it using the new_method_proxy function similar to other dunder methods implemented in the LazyObject class. The relevant sections of the code to address this issue are the sections where LazyObject and SimpleLazyObject are defined, particularly where the new_method_proxy function is used and defined. There's enough context in the provided search results to conclude that the missing __radd__ method should similarly use the new_method_proxy function, and the necessary imports and structure are already in place in the codebase.",
