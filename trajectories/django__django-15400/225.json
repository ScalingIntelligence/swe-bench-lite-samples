The current context shows that SimpleLazyObject is a subclass of LazyObject and does not define the __radd__ method. The search results confirm this, as they include the SimpleLazyObject class definition but do not contain the __radd__ method. Additionally, the search results include the Promise class and its methods, highlighting a fully implemented proxy that contrasts with the lacking implementation in SimpleLazyObject. Specifically, in the Promise class, there's an __radd__ method defined, showing how it should work as a proxy for the right addition operation. This comparison suggests that SimpleLazyObject needs to implement or inherit this method to function correctly for reverse addition operations. Given this analysis, it is clear that the relevant code spans would be the SimpleLazyObject class and the missing __radd__ method.",
