In the search results, I found the definition of SimpleLazyObject within the django/utils/functional.py file. This class inherits from LazyObject and does not currently have an implementation for __radd__. To address the issue, a minimal implementation of __radd__ needs to be added to the SimpleLazyObject class. I propose to add a new span specifically for the __radd__ method to complete the implementation as described in the issue. This implementation will check if the _wrapped attribute is empty and then call _setup() if necessary, before returning the result of other + self._wrapped. Although the current search results do not directly contain the __radd__ method, they provide the context and structure needed to implement it correctly within the SimpleLazyObject class.",
