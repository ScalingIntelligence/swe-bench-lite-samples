The provided minimal implementation for __radd__ in the issue description suggests adding a method that checks if the wrapped object is empty, sets it up if necessary, and then performs the addition operation. The search results also show other methods of SimpleLazyObject, such as __copy__, __deepcopy__, and the constructor __init__, which indicates that new code can be added for __radd__ without significant modification to unrelated parts of the class.
