The relevant code spans are those defining the SimpleLazyObject class and its existing methods. Specifically, the code spans 'SimpleLazyObject', 'SimpleLazyObject.__init__', and 'SimpleLazyObject._setup' are relevant because they outline the class's current functionality, which we need to extend by adding the __radd__ method. The provided solution suggests a minimal implementation of this method, which checks if the wrapped object is empty, sets it up if necessary, and then performs the addition operation.
