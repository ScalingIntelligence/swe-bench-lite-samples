Given the information provided, there are two directions for search. First, we should locate the SimpleLazyObject class within the codebase to confirm its current implementation and potentially suggest improvements or fixes to include the __radd__ method. Second, we should also consider other classes in a similar or related context that might proxy methods such as the LazyObject class or any other class that might use similar lazy initialization patterns. Understanding how these classes interact and how methods like __radd__ should be implemented is crucial for a complete solution.",
