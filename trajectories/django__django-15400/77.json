We already have a context in `django/utils/functional.py` that includes the `SimpleLazyObject` class and its associated methods, but it lacks the __radd__ implementation. In the provided search results, we find the __radd__ method implemented in two places: in `django/db/models/expressions.py` within the Combinable class and in `django/contrib/gis/geos/mutable_list.py` within the ListMixin class. However, these implementations are not directly in SimpleLazyObject or its immediate parent class LazyObject. Therefore, the search results do not directly provide a solution within the context of SimpleLazyObject. Given the context and the search results, we should focus on the `SimpleLazyObject` class in `django/utils/functional.py` as the likely location for implementing the __radd__ method based on the reported issue. The existing structure and method proxy approach in `SimpleLazyObject` suggest that a similar technique could be applied to __radd__ as was done for other magic methods. Thus, the identified spans should lead to the development of the missing __radd__ method directly within the `SimpleLazyObject` class, leveraging the existing `new_method_proxy` function if applicable. The search task is not considered complete as the solution pertains specifically to `SimpleLazyObject`, and no direct implementation of __radd__ was found within its class or relevant methods in the provided search results.",
