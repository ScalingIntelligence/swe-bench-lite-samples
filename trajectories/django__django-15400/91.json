From the search results, it is clear that the SimpleLazyObject class is indeed defined in the django/utils/functional.py file, and it inherits from LazyObject. However, the current implementation lacks the __radd__ method. Based on the minimal implementation provided in the issue, the necessary code to add __radd__ to the SimpleLazyObject class is straightforward. The implementation checks if the wrapped object is empty and calls _setup() if necessary, followed by returning the result of the reverse addition operation on the wrapped object. This aligns perfectly with the issue's requirements, making the identified code span highly relevant to resolving the issue.",
