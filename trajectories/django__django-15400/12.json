The current file context shows that SimpleLazyObject inherits from LazyObject and has methods like __init__, __copy__, and __deepcopy__, but none of these address the __radd__ requirement. The new search results provide a glimpse into how similar functionalities are handled by related classes and functions. Notably, the Promise class and the lazy function in the search results have implemented __radd__, suggesting that this functionality might have been intentionally or unintentionally left out in SimpleLazyObject. Given this insight, it's evident that the implementation of __radd__ in SimpleLazyObject could be modeled after the __radd__ method found in Promise or adjusted as per SimpleLazyObject's specific needs. The minimal implementation as suggested by the issue reporter involves overriding the __radd__ method to handle the reverse addition in the context of the LazyObject's wrapped object, ensuring proper setup and operation of the SimpleLazyObject instance.",
