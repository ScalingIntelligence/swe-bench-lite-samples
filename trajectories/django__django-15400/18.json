The search results provide extensive context on the SimpleLazyObject class and its parent class LazyObject, including various magic methods that are already implemented. The parent class LazyObject uses a method_proxy pattern defined in new_method_proxy to forward method calls to the wrapped object once it's initialized. However, the __radd__ method, which is crucial for the operation described in the issue, is not implemented in either LazyObject or SimpleLazyObject. This missing method is directly relevant to the issue. Implementing __radd__ requires adding a new method to SimpleLazyObject that checks if the object is initialized and then performs the reverse addition operation. Given this, the identified spans are those related to SimpleLazyObject and the method proxy mechanism for context and reference in implementing the new __radd__ method.",
