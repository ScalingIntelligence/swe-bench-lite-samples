The SimpleLazyObject class is derived from LazyObject and has several method implementations, but none for __radd__.\n3. The __proxy__ class within the lazy function has implementations for both __add__ and __radd__, which could serve as a model for implementing __radd__ in SimpleLazyObject.\n\nGiven these findings, the task is not yet complete as SimpleLazyObject needs a proper implementation of __radd__.

Given the context, it's evident that SimpleLazyObject extends LazyObject and lacks several dunder methods, primarily __radd__. The minimal implementation suggested in the issue involves explicitly defining the __radd__ method within the SimpleLazyObject class. However, current context and search results both confirm the absence of this method in the codebase. Analyzing the search results, especially under the SimpleLazyObject section, there's a clear absence of the __radd__ method, which matches the issue description. As per the minimal implementation in the issue, applying this within the SimpleLazyObject class would resolve the problem. Thus, the identified relevance of the issue directly links to the omission of the __radd__ method in the SimpleLazyObject class as shown in the search results.",
