Given the context, focusing on the django/utils/functional.py file where SimpleLazyObject is defined is crucial. A method similar to __radd__ should be implemented to handle the operation correctly. This involves checking if the wrapped object is empty, setting it up if necessary, and then performing the addition. The solution proposed in the issue involves manually implementing __radd__ in a manner that accommodates the lazy object's state.

This implementation checks if the '_wrapped' attribute is 'empty', and if so, it calls '_setup()' before performing the addition. This is consistent with the minimal implementation provided in the reported issue. The '__radd__' method is thus already implemented and aligns well with the requirement. Therefore, the search results are relevant and complete for addressing the issue reported. \n\nHowever, if the intention was to suggest improvements or modifications to the existing __radd__ method based on the description in the issue, further analysis would be needed to ensure all aspects are covered, such as checking for the existence of '__radd__' in the type as mentioned.

This method checks if self._wrapped is empty and sets it up if necessary, then returns the result of other plus self._wrapped.
