The SimpleLazyObject class is a subclass of LazyObject, and the file context shows the existing methods implemented in LazyObject, such as __eq__, __lt__, etc., which are implemented using new_method_proxy. This setup is relevant to the issue since the new __radd__ method can be implemented similarly in SimpleLazyObject using new_method_proxy if operator.radd existed, which it doesn't. Given this context, it can be concluded that the relevant class and method setup that would need to be modified to address the issue are present in the file context.
