My analysis of the provided search results revealed that SimpleLazyObject inherits from LazyObject and does not currently implement __radd__. The user's minimal implementation of __radd__ should be added to SimpleLazyObject to resolve this issue. Also, there are related methods such as __add__ and __deepcopy__ that are well implemented in SimpleLazyObject, which could be used as a guide for creating __radd__.\n\nI identified the relevant code spans in the search results, specifically the SimpleLazyObject class and its subclasses, to ensure full context for decision-making. It was crucial to see all code in these sections to accurately determine relevance and context. I chose these sections because they directly relate to the SimpleLazyObject class, which needs a new __radd__ method.\n\nHowever, a gap exists as __radd__ is not currently implemented in the SimpleLazyObject class. Based on the minimal implementation provided by the user and the context of comparable methods in the class, I can guide adding the necessary code to patch this gap.",

  "initial_message": "SimpleLazyObject doesn't implement __radd__\nDescription\n\t\nTechnically, there's a whole bunch of magic methods it doesn't implement, compared to a complete proxy implementation, like that of wrapt.ObjectProxy, but __radd__ being missing is the one that's biting me at the moment.\nAs far as I can tell, the implementation can't just be\n__radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.radd)\nbecause that doesn't exist, which is rubbish.\n__radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.attrgetter(\"__radd__\"))\nalso won't work because types may not have that attr, and attrgetter doesn't supress the exception (correctly)\nThe minimal implementation I've found that works for me is:\n\tdef __radd__(self, other):\n\t\tif self._wrapped is empty:\n\t\t\tself._setup()\n\t\treturn other + self._wrapped\n"
