From the search results, we can see that `SimpleLazyObject` is indeed a part of the codebase, inheriting from `LazyObject`. The missing `__radd__` method is crucial for the current problem. By examining the `__proxy__` class within the `lazy` function, we observe that it includes an implementation for `__radd__` which could be adapted or replicated in `SimpleLazyObject`. This implementation might serve as a good reference to how `__radd__` could be implemented effectively in `SimpleLazyObject` to resolve the issue. Since `SimpleLazyObject` currently does not have the `__radd__` method implemented, it should be added based on the minimum implementation described in the issue or adapted from the `__proxy__` implementation within the `lazy` function that checks if the wrapped object is set before attempting the operation.",
