Specifically, the `SimpleLazyObject` class, which is a subclass of `LazyObject`, currently implements methods for copying (`__copy__` and `__deepcopy__`). However, the necessary `__radd__` method for reflected addition is still missing. To address this, we should focus on finding or developing a utility function or decorator within this module that can dynamically add missing magic methods like `__radd__`. Given the use of `self._wrapped` in `SimpleLazyObject`, we should ensure that any utility function can interact with this property to implement the required method.",

Given the minimal implementation provided in the issue description, it is clear that this method is missing from both LazyObject and SimpleLazyObject classes. The task thus involves adding this method to SimpleLazyObject class in 'django/utils/functional.py' to align with the functionality expected in the issue description.",
