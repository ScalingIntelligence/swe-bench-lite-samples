Upon analyzing the search results from `django/utils/functional.py`, I identified the relevant code spans. The issue describes a minimal implementation of `__radd__` which checks if the wrapped object is empty, sets it up if necessary, and then performs the addition. This matches closely with the existing `__radd__` implementation in the `lazy` function's `__proxy__` class. However, `SimpleLazyObject` does not currently have an `__radd__` method. Therefore, the relevant spans to address the issue are those related to `SimpleLazyObject` and the `lazy` function, particularly the parts that deal with the `__radd__` operation in proxy classes. This includes the `__radd__` method definition in the `__proxy__` class and the overall structure of how `SimpleLazyObject` handles its wrapped objects. These findings indicate that the current implementation of `SimpleLazyObject` lacks the `__radd__` method, which is the core concern of the reported issue. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant for addressing the lack of `__radd__` in `SimpleLazyObject`.",
