This is a crucial part of the functionality needed to address the issue. The relevant code spans to focus on are the class definition and its methods, particularly where the _wrapped attribute is handled, as this is where the __radd__ method would need to be implemented to interact with wrapped objects correctly. These spans do not currently include the implementation of __radd__, indicating that more work is needed to fully address the issue.

  "initial_message": "SimpleLazyObject doesn't implement __radd__\nDescription\n\t\nTechnically, there's a whole bunch of magic methods it doesn't implement, compared to a complete proxy implementation, like that of wrapt.ObjectProxy, but __radd__ being missing is the one that's biting me at the moment.\nAs far as I can tell, the implementation can't just be\n__radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.radd)\nbecause that doesn't exist, which is rubbish.\n__radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.attrgetter(\"__radd__\"))\nalso won't work because types may not have that attr, and attrgetter doesn't supress the exception (correctly)\nThe minimal implementation I've found that works for me is:\n\tdef __radd__(self, other):\n\t\tif self._wrapped is empty:\n\t\t\tself._setup()\n\t\treturn other + self._wrapped\n"
