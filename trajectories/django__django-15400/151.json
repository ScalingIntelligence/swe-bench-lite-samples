I examined the provided search results, specifically focusing on the SimpleLazyObject class and its associated methods. I noticed that while SimpleLazyObject inherits from LazyObject and overrides some methods like __init__, _setup, __repr__, __copy__, and __deepcopy__, it does not contain an implementation for __radd__. The LazyObject class itself also does not implement __radd__. Therefore, the missing __radd__ method is a clear match for the issue reported. To resolve the issue, it would be necessary to add the __radd__ method to either the LazyObject or SimpleLazyObject class. Given the description of the minimal implementation provided in the issue, it suggests that this method could be implemented similarly to other dunder methods already present in the LazyObject class, leveraging the new_method_proxy function if appropriate. The presence of other magic methods like __eq__, __lt__, and __gt__ implemented with new_method_proxy in LazyObject suggests that mirroring that approach for __radd__ would align with the existing code structure and behaviors. This approach also ensures that the _wrapped attribute is properly set up before attempting any operations.",
