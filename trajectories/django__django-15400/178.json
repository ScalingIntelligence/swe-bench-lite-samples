The search results provided contain the entire implementation of SimpleLazyObject within django/utils/functional.py. This includes methods such as __init__, _setup, __repr__, __copy__, and __deepcopy__, but notably missing is the __radd__ method. The reported issue suggests a minimal implementation for __radd__, which could be directly integrated into SimpleLazyObject to resolve the problem. Given that SimpleLazyObject is a subclass of LazyObject and uses a proxy pattern for many of its methods, it should follow the same pattern established in the new_method_proxy function for implementing the __radd__ method. The existing spans for SimpleLazyObject show where this new method could fit into the class definition, ensuring consistency with other methods implemented via new_method_proxy. Adding a span for the specific location where __radd__ can be implemented in the SimpleLazyObject class is necessary to address the reported issue.",
