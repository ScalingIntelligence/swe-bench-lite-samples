Upon reviewing the search results, it's clear that the `SimpleLazyObject` class is indeed present in the provided code span, inheriting from `LazyObject`. However, the `__radd__` method is missing. To resolve this, it's suggested to implement the `__radd__` method within the `SimpleLazyObject` class as shown in the user's minimal implementation.\n\nRelevant parts of the code to address this include the `SimpleLazyObject` class definition itself and the `_setup` method since the implementation of `__radd__` might need to call `_setup` to ensure the object is properly initialized before performing the addition operation.",
