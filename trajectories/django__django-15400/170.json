This method is necessary for the object to be added to another object using the reverse addition operation. The current file context shows the definition of `SimpleLazyObject` and some of its methods, but notably missing is the `__radd__` method.\n\nHowever, the new search results provide additional context about the `SimpleLazyObject` class, including its `_setup` method and other dunder methods. The `_setup` method initializes the wrapped object, which is a key part in implementing the `__radd__` method as suggested in the issue description. This method checks if the object is initialized and initializes it if not before performing the reverse addition operation.\n\nBased on this understanding, the relevant code spans to address the issue would include the `_setup` method and the part of the class definition where the `SimpleLazyObject` is initialized. These elements are necessary to implement the suggested `__radd__` method in a way that adheres to the class's behavior and setup logic.",
