Specifically, the `Combinable` class and `ListMixin` class in the search results have implementations of `__radd__` that could guide the implementation in `SimpleLazyObject`. The `__radd__` method in the `Combinable` class uses the `_combine` method to handle the operation, while in `ListMixin`, it concatenates the two objects and returns a new instance. These examples can be useful for understanding how to implement a similar functionality in the `SimpleLazyObject` class.\n\nI will identify the relevant code spans from the search results that show how the `__radd__` method is implemented in other classes, as they can serve as a reference for implementing it in the `SimpleLazyObject` class.
