Upon reviewing the provided search results, it's evident that the SimpleLazyObject class does not currently have this method implemented. The relevant code spans to focus on are those within the SimpleLazyObject class definition, as implementing __radd__ should ideally be done within this class. The class already contains methods like __init__, _setup, __repr__, __copy__, and __deepcopy__, which could serve as a template for where to add the missing __radd__ method. Given the structure and logic of the other methods, it's clear that the new __radd__ method should be added within this class definition to maintain consistency and functionality. This approach not only addresses the immediate issue but also potentially paves the way for future improvements by aligning with existing patterns and conventions.",
