The provided search results include the SimpleLazyObject class definition and some of its methods such as __init__, _setup, __repr__, __copy__, and __deepcopy__. However, the focus should be on identifying the relevant part of the code where the __radd__ method can be added or modified to handle the right-hand side addition operation correctly. The current code doesn't include the __radd__ method, which is the primary missing piece as per the issue description. Therefore, the relevant code span should be the one where the SimpleLazyObject class is defined, so that the missing method can be added to this class.
