The error indicates that there might be a problem with how the 'hue' parameter is being processed within the `PairGrid` class and its related methods, especially when using `map` with 'hue'. The error specifically mentions `_lookup_single` method in `HueMapping` from `seaborn._oldcore`, which suggests that the inconsistency might be rooted in how data types are handled during hue mapping. Investigating the `PairGrid` class, `map` methods within `axisgrid.py`, and the `_lookup_single` method within `seaborn._oldcore` should provide insights into the source of this compatibility issue.",

The error does not occur in version 0.11.0, indicating a regression. The traceback suggests that the issue arises when the `HueMapping` class in `_oldcore.py` attempts to look up a value for the 'hue' attribute. The specific error occurs in the `_lookup_single` method of the `HueMapping` class, where it fails to find a key in the `lookup_table` and then tries to normalize the key using the `norm` function, which fails because `norm` is `None`.\n\nThe relevant sections of the search results focus on how `PairGrid` handles the `hue` parameter and how `HueMapping` attempts to map the `hue` values to colors. The `PairGrid` class's `__init__` method initializes the `hue`-related attributes, including the palette and the order of hue values. The `map` method of `PairGrid` and its helper methods, such as `_map_bivariate` and `_plot_bivariate`, are responsible for applying the user-defined function across the grid, with consideration for the `hue` parameter. The `HueMapping` class, specifically the `_lookup_single` method, is where the error occurs, attempting to map a hue value to a color.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the following spans of code appear to be most relevant: the `__init__` method of `PairGrid` where the `hue` attributes are set up, the `map` method of `PairGrid` where the user-defined function (like `scatterplot`) is applied with the `hue` parameter, and the `_lookup_single` method in the `HueMapping` class where the actual error originates.",

The issue seems to be related to how the `hue` parameter is handled within the `PairGrid` class and the `scatterplot` function when called via `g.map`. The error messages indicate that there is an issue with the type of the `hue` data or the way the colormap is being applied. I identified multiple spans that might be relevant to this issue, particularly focusing on the initialization and mapping logic within the `PairGrid` class, as well as the `_lookup_single` method in the `HueMapping` class which handles the actual mapping of hue values to colors. To resolve this issue, it might be necessary to review how hue data is being processed and ensure that the `norm` and `cmap` attributes are properly set up or revised to handle the change in behavior from version 0.9.0 to 0.11.1.",
