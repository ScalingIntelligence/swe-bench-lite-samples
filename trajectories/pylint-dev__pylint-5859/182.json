The focus should be on the logic within pylint that processes and matches the `--notes` option with the note tags in the code. The relevant files likely include those where the `--notes` option processing logic resides, potentially within the pylint/lint/pylinter.py file given its role in handling configurations like options. Specific functions or classes handling the `--notes` option, such as those involved in setting or processing options, or filtering notes could be relevant. Additionally, the pylint/utils/pragma_parser.py might also be pertinent for parsing pragma directives that could include note tags.",

This issue causes pylint to ignore such note tags when specified with the `--notes` option. The key elements to focus on are the handling of note tags, the `--notes` option, and how pylint processes these tags to determine if they should trigger a fixme warning (W0511). The search results provide valuable context in the `PyLinter` class, which manages the options and processes tokens. Particularly relevant are the methods handling options, such as `set_option`, and the token processing in `process_tokens`. Additionally, the `parse_pragma` function in `pragma_parser.py` is crucial as it interprets the inline options that could include the `--notes` option. These sections of code are essential for understanding how pylint integrates and responds to configuration options and pragmas, which is directly related to the reported issue. Furthermore, the configuration and message management in the `PyLinter` class are relevant since they dictate how different messages, including fixme warnings, are enabled or disabled based on various conditions.",

Specifically, it mentions that when a note tag is entirely punctuation (e.g., '???'), pylint does not report a fixme warning (W0511). The expected behavior is that pylint should report the fixme warning for such tags. To address this, the focus should be on the PyLinter class in the pylint/lint/pylinter.py file, particularly the process_tokens method where the handling of pragma comments is performed. Additionally, the parse_pragma function in the pylint/utils/pragma_parser.py file is relevant as it parses the pragma comments to determine their actions and messages. The expected outcome is to identify the relevant code spans that handle the parsing and processing of the --notes option and its associated tags, particularly focusing on how punctuation tags are managed.",
