The relevant code spans are found in the `pylint/checkers/misc.py` file. Specifically, the `EncodingChecker` class is responsible for handling the `W0511` fixme warning. The `options` attribute of this class includes `notes`, which is a list of note tags to consider. The `open` method of this class constructs a regex pattern to match note tags based on user-specified notes or a custom regex. The issue likely stems from how this regex pattern is constructed. The `process_tokens` method is also relevant, as it processes tokens and checks for notes matching the pattern to generate the fixme warning.
