The current challenge revolves around the proper use of `pytest.skip` with the `allow_module_level` parameter, which is discouraged by the error message. The task is to improve the documentation, error messages, or possibly introduce a new API to handle this more gracefully. Given the context, we need to focus on `src/_pytest/outcomes.py` and `src/_pytest/skipping.py` as these files deal with outcomes and skipping logic. Additionally, `testing/python/collect.py` and `testing/python/metafunc.py` may provide context or tests related to module collection and parametrization.",

To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, does not work  in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).\r\n\r\nThe correct solution, to use skip as a function is actively discouraged by the error message.\r\n\r\nThis area feels a bit unpolished.\r\nA few ideas to improve:\r\n\r\n1. Explain skip with  `allow_module_level` in the error message. this seems in conflict with the spirit of the message.\r\n2. Create an alternative API to skip a module to make things easier: `skip_module(\"reason\")`, which can call `_skip(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)`.\r\n\r\n\n"
