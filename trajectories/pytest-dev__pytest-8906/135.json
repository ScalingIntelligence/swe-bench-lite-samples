            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on improving the handling of module-level skips in pytest, particularly for scenarios where Python version constraints require skipping tests at the module level due to syntax issues (e.g., Python 3.8 syntax in modules that should not be tested under Python 3.6 and 3.7). The issue identifies the need to update documentation, error messages, or introduce a new API for better handling of such scenarios. Key aspects include identifying how to correctly skip modules based on Python version and improving user guidance through better error messages and API options.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant code spans, particularly those related to pytest's skipping mechanisms and module handling:\n\n1. **src/_pytest/skipping.py**: This file contains the `evaluate_skip_marks` function, which evaluates whether a test item should be skipped based on markers like 'skip' and 'skipif'. Understanding how these markers are processed is crucial for knowing how pytest currently handles skips, potentially relevant for enhancing the skip mechanism as per the requirement.\n\n2. **src/_pytest/outcomes.py**: The `skip` function is defined here, which raises a `Skipped` exception. This function is tagged with an `allow_module_level` option, suggesting that this is the current method to skip at the module level. This span is highly relevant as it directly addresses the core functionality required for the issue.\n\n3. **src/_pytest/python.py**: This file has multiple spans involving the collection of modules and handling Python objects during the pytest collection process. Understanding how modules are collected and processed at a high level by pytest is important for designing a new, improved mechanism. However, these spans are more general and provide context rather than precise functionality modifications.\n\n4. **src/_pytest/main.py**: Contains the `wrap_session` and `_main` functions which are central to pytest's runtime execution. Although not directly modifying the skip behavior, understanding the session flow can be useful for determining where and how to integrate new skipping functionalities.\n\nBased on this analysis, the next step involves identifying specific spans within these files that either directly handle or influence the skip behavior. Currently, the spans from `skipping.py` and `outcomes.py` appear the most directly relevant to addressing the issue. These should be included for a deeper analysis to understand how the current skip mechanism operates and how it could be improved to accommodate the new requirement.",
