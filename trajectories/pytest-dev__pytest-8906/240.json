The current mechanism using `pytest.skip` with `allow_module_level=True` is not well-articulated in error messages and user guidance. Multiple solutions are proposed, including enhancing error messages to mention `allow_module_level` and introducing a new API for module skipping. To address this, we should focus on the `pytest` module, specifically looking into how skips are handled, particularly at the module level, and how error messages are generated related to skipping. We should also consider the possibility of adding new APIs for better module-level skipping.",

To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, does not work  in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).\r\n\r\nThe correct solution, to use skip as a function is actively discouraged by the error message.\r\n\r\nThis area feels a bit unpolished.\r\nA few ideas to improve:\r\n\r\n1. Explain skip with  `allow_module_level` in the error message. this seems in conflict with the spirit of the message.\r\n2. Create an alternative API to skip a module to make things easier: `skip_module(\"reason\")`, which can call `_skip(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)`.\r\n\r\n\n"
