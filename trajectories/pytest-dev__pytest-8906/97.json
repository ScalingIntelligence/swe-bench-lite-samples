The current approach using `pytest.skip` with `allow_module_level=True` is discouraged by error messages, leading to confusion. The suggested improvements include updating error messages to better explain module-level skipping or introducing a new API to simplify this process. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the `_pytest/outcomes.py` file, which houses the `skip` function, and possibly other files related to pytest configuration and skipping mechanics would be beneficial. Additionally, considering files like `src/_pytest/python.py` and `src/_pytest/skipping.py` might provide more insights into module handling and skipping logic.",
