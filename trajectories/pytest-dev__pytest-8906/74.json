The problem arises because the current mechanism for skipping a module is not straightforward and leads to errors when attempting to use `pytest.skip` at the module level. To address this, we should focus on the `pytest_configure` function and related functions in `src/_pytest/` directory, as these are crucial for configuring pytest and handling skips. Additionally, we should look into the `skip` function and related markers that handle skipping functionality. This includes examining the `skipping.py` and `outcomes.py` files.",

            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it's clear that the focus is on improving the handling of module-level skips in pytest, particularly when dealing with conditional skips based on the Python version. The challenge lies in ensuring that the module is skipped gracefully when using a Python version that doesn't support certain syntax or features. The current approach using `pytest.skip` with `allow_module_level=True` is discouraged but necessary for the specific use case described. The error message provided discourages the use of `pytest.skip` at the module level, suggesting to use markers like `@pytest.mark.skip` or `@pytest.mark.skipif` instead. However, these solutions do not cater to the requirement of skipping an entire module based on version compatibility.\n\nReviewing the search results, several key areas are identified that might be relevant to address the issue:\n1. **src/_pytest/skipping.py** contains the definition of `Skip` and `evaluate_skip_marks`, which evaluate whether a test should be skipped based on markers. This is particularly relevant as it handles the conditional logic for skips.\n2. **src/_pytest/outcomes.py** defines the `Skipped` class and the `skip` function, which includes the `allow_module_level` parameter. This indicates that the functionality to skip at the module level is already present but might not be user-friendly or clearly documented.\n\nConsidering the requirement to improve user experience and the potential conflict between the desired functionality and the error message, the identified code spans show the current implementation and usage of module-level skipping. These are crucial points for potential modifications or enhancements to align with the reported issue's requirements.",
