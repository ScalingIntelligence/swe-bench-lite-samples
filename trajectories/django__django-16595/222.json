The problem arises when these AlterFields are not reduced when separated from an AddField operation, potentially due to the AlterField.reduce method not handling instances of AlterField effectively. The relevant files and classes identified so far include AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, along with the MigrationOptimizer in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`. These are central to understanding and fixing the issue. The next steps involve focusing on the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class and the `optimize` method in the `MigrationOptimizer` class.",

The issue specifically mentions the 'AlterField' operation and its reduce method, suggesting that the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField if the AddField is separated from them. In the search results, I found two relevant files: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. The 'fields.py' file contains the definition of the 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method, which did not initially consider reducing AlterField operations to the same field. This is significant because enhancing this method might resolve the issue. Additionally, the 'optimizer.py' file contains the 'MigrationOptimizer' class with the 'optimize' method, which is central to how the optimizer handles migration operations. Both these sections of code are directly related to the reported issue, particularly the 'reduce' method in 'AlterField' which, according to the issue, does not currently handle the reduction of AlterField to the same field.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
