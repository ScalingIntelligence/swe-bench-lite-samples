The issue suggests that the current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method does not handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField, leading to multiple AlterField operations not being reduced as expected. This behavior is not intended and potentially problematic. To address this, the issue proposes a modification to the AlterField.reduce method by adding a condition to handle instances of AlterField within the reduce method. Parsing the provided search results, particularly focusing on the `AlterField` and `FieldOperation` classes, reveals the current implementation of these methods. The relevant code spans include the `AlterField.reduce` method which currently does not consider AlterField instances for reduction. This aligns with the issue's description. Other relevant methods include `FieldOperation.reduce` and `AddField.reduce`, though these do not directly address the issue at hand. The proposed modification for the AlterField.reduce method is thus a sensible addition to handle the reduction of multiple AlterField operations on the same field. The search task can be considered complete as the relevant code spans have been identified and analyzed.",

The current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method does not consider reducing subsequent AlterField operations into a single operation when they are applied to the same field. This leads to inefficiencies in the migration process.\n\nThe provided search results include the relevant code spans from the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, which define the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method. The current `reduce` method only considers reducing an AlterField operation with a RemoveField or RenameField operation, but not with another AlterField operation.\n\nTo address the issue, the proposed solution suggests modifying the `reduce` method to handle the case where `operation` is an instance of `AlterField` and the fields are the same. This would allow the optimizer to reduce multiple AlterField operations into a single operation, improving migration efficiency.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue are the `AlterField` class definition and its `reduce` method. These spans should be included in the identified spans to provide a clear context for the necessary changes.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
