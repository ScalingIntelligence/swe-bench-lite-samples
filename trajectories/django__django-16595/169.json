Specifically, the issue points to the `AlterField.reduce` method where the reduction logic for AlterField operations is implemented. It is noted that the `reduce` method does not currently check if the operation is an instance of `AlterField` and therefore fails to reduce multiple consecutive AlterField operations. The suggested fix involves adding a condition in the `reduce` method to handle this case.\n\nIn the provided search results and file context, the relevant code sections are within the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file. Specifically, the file contains the `AlterField` class with its `reduce` method. This method is crucial for understanding how the optimizer handles field alterations, which directly corresponds to the reported issue. The current implementation of `reduce` does not account for the case where multiple AlterField operations modify the same field, which aligns with the issue reported.\n\nGiven the file context and search results, the identified spans are the `AlterField.__init__` and `AlterField.reduce` methods. These spans are relevant because they include the constructor of the `AlterField` class, which initializes the field alteration operation, and the `reduce` method, which is the focus of the reported issue as it currently lacks handling for multiple subsequent AlterField operations. Including these spans will help in addressing the issue by potentially integrating the suggested fix into the `reduce` method.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
