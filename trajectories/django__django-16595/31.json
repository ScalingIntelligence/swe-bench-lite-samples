            "scratch_pad": "The issue describes a problem with the migration optimizer in Django where multiple AlterField operations are not being reduced as expected. The problem specifically concerns the AlterField.reduce method not considering the case where operation is also an AlterField. Given the detailed context provided, the focus should primarily be on the 'optimize' and 'reduce' methods within the Django migration operations, particularly those related to AlterField and AddField. The exact code snippet provided in the issue suggests that we need to look for instances where 'is_same_field_operation' is implemented or referenced, especially within the AlterField class or related optimization logic. Moreover, we should ensure to check not only 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' which directly contains the logic for these operations, but also 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' where the optimization logic itself is defined and executed. Finally, to fully understand the context and potential fixes, 'django/db/migrations/operations/base.py' should also be reviewed as it contains the Operation base class with a 'reduce' method that might influence how field operations are reduced.",

This method is responsible for determining how operations should be reduced or combined. The current implementation of `AlterField.reduce` only considers `RemoveField` and `RenameField`. Expanding this to include `AlterField` could potentially resolve the issue. The relevant code spans are in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, specifically focusing on the `AlterField.reduce`, `FieldOperation.is_same_field_operation`, and the `AlterField` class initialization. It appears that the current logic does not account for the case where an operation is an `AlterField`. Enhancing the `AlterField.reduce` method to handle such scenarios could lead to better optimization of migrations.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
