The problem occurs when these operations are not condensed into a single AlterField during the optimization process. Specifically, the AlterField.reduce method does not currently consider the case where the operation being reduced is also an AlterField. To debug and potentially fix this, we need to focus on the migration optimization logic and the reduce methods within the field operations in Django. The search should target the specific files and methods involved in these operations.",

This suggests a potential gap in the reduction logic within the `AlterField.reduce` method. The provided search results include the relevant Django code responsible for handling field operations and migration optimization. Specifically, the `AlterField` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` are critical. The `AlterField.reduce` method currently checks for reductions involving `RemoveField` and `RenameField` but does not consider the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`. This missing case could be addressed by adding a check for `isinstance(operation, AlterField)` and using the `is_same_field_operation` method to determine if the fields are the same. This addition would likely resolve the issue by allowing the optimizer to recognize and reduce consecutive `AlterField` operations. The `MigrationOptimizer.optimize` and `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` methods also play a crucial role in the optimization process, but the direct solution to the reported issue lies in enhancing the `AlterField.reduce` method. Thus, the identified relevant code spans are those within the `AlterField.reduce` method, which should be modified to include a check for `AlterField` operations.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
