The current implementation does not reduce AlterField operations when they are not preceded by an AddField operation. The focus should be on the AlterField class within the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file, particularly the reduce method. Additionally, the MigrationOptimizer class in django/db/migrations/optimizer.py should be examined to understand its optimization logic. Further, the reduce method in the Operation base class and other related classes might also provide insights into how operations are being handled and reduced.",

This typically happens when there is a non-elidable migration or if the operations are inside a non-squashed migration. The issue points out that the `AlterField.reduce` method does not currently consider the case when the operation being reduced is also an AlterField. This results in the optimizer not being able to condense these AlterField operations into a single operation, even when they all alter the same field. The suggested solution includes a modification to the `AlterField.reduce` method to handle this case. The provided search results include relevant code spans from the Django migration framework. Specifically, the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' are relevant, as is the `MigrationOptimizer` class and its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. These code spans are analyzed to determine their relevance and whether they address the issue at hand. The analysis shows that the current implementation of `AlterField.reduce` only considers `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations for reduction, but does not handle the reduction of one `AlterField` by another. This explains why the optimizer is not reducing multiple AlterField operations as described in the issue. The suggested modification to the `AlterField.reduce` method would address this gap and should be considered for implementation.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
