Specifically, it mentions that when multiple AlterField operations are present and separated from an AddField operation, they are not reduced as expected. This suggests a potential bug in the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class or the optimizer logic. To address this, we should investigate the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class and the overall optimization logic in the `MigrationOptimizer` class.",

The user is particularly concerned about the behavior of the AlterField.reduce method, which does not currently handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField. This results in redundant AlterField operations not being reduced. To address this, the user suggests adding a condition to the reduce method to handle AlterField operations more effectively.\n\nIn the provided search results, two key files are identified: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. These files contain the definitions and implementations of the migration operations and the optimizer, respectively.\n\nIn 'fields.py', the relevant classes are AddField and AlterField. The AddField class includes methods for initialization, state forward, database backward, and reduction logic. The AlterField class also includes similar methods but lacks the specific condition suggested by the user to handle instances where the operation is an AlterField.\n\nIn 'optimizer.py', the MigrationOptimizer class includes the main optimization method 'optimize', which calls 'optimize_inner' to perform the actual optimization. The 'optimize_inner' method iterates through the operations and tries to reduce them where possible. The current implementation does not specifically address the reduction of multiple AlterField operations in a way that aligns with the user's issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are the reduce methods in both AddField and AlterField classes in 'fields.py'. The identified spans include the entire reduce method in AddField and the reduce method in AlterField, where the suggested condition can be implemented.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
