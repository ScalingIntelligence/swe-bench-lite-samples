The main concern is that when these operations are not adjacent, the optimizer does not reduce them as expected. This might involve the `AlterField` class's `reduce` method not considering reductions between `AlterField` operations effectively. This could be addressed by enhancing the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class or the overall migration optimizer logic. Given the context provided, focusing on the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` files seems appropriate to start investigating. Possibly, enhancing the `reduce` method within the `AlterField` class to handle `AlterField` operations more effectively could be the resolution.",
