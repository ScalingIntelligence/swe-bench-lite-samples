This issue is particularly relevant in the context of the `AlterField` class and the `MigrationOptimizer` class. The `AlterField` class defines the behavior of altering fields in Django models, including methods like `__init__`, `deconstruct`, `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, `database_backwards`, `describe`, `migration_name_fragment`, and `reduce`. The `reduce` method is of particular interest as it currently only handles reductions for `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations, but does not consider reducing multiple `AlterField` operations. The `MigrationOptimizer` class is responsible for optimizing the migration operations. Its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods iterate through operations to reduce them where possible, but the current implementation does not account for the scenario described in the issue where multiple `AlterField` operations should be reduced. Given these contexts, the relevant code spans include the entire `AlterField` class definition and the `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods in the `MigrationOptimizer` class, as these are the areas where changes need to be made to address the issue.",

Specifically, the issue points out that when an AddField operation is separated from the subsequent AlterField operations, the optimizer does not reduce the AlterField operations, even though they modify the same field.\n\nGiven the context from the existing file and the new search results, it's clear that the AlterField class contains a reduce method that currently only handles specific cases like RemoveField and RenameField. The issue suggests adding a condition to handle cases where the operation is also an AlterField. The relevant code spans can be found in the AlterField class's reduce method in both the existing file context and the new search results. This method would need to be updated to include the new condition as suggested in the issue.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans include:\n- The entire AlterField class definition, particularly the reduce method, which handles the reduction logic for field operations.\n- The FieldOperation class's reduce method, as it serves as a base for all field operations and could potentially influence how the AlterField's reduce method behaves.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
