Specifically, multiple 'AlterField' operations on the same field are not being reduced when they should be. This suggests a possible bug in the 'reduce' method of the 'AlterField' class or a missing handling case in the migration optimizer. To address this, we need to focus our search on the 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method, as well as the optimizer's ability to handle successive 'AlterField' operations.",

The key points are that the current optimizer does not reduce contiguous AlterField operations when they are separated from an AddField operation. The suggestion is to enhance the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class to consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField.\n\nThe search results provide relevant code spans that can help address this issue. The `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method are found in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. This method currently checks for various field operations (AddField, RemoveField, RenameField) but does not specifically handle the scenario where the operation is another AlterField. The current implementation returns if the operation is a RemoveField and checks for RenameField, but it doesn't handle consecutive AlterField operations.\n\nGiven the issue, the suggested enhancement in the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class should be implemented to manage this case. This implementation requires careful consideration to ensure that consecutive AlterField operations can be detected and reduced appropriately.",
