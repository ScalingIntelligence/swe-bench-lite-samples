Specifically, the issue notes that the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField operations when they are separated from an AddField operation. This suggests a need to enhance the reduce method in the AlterField class to handle cases where the operation is also an AlterField.\n\nFrom the search results, we can see several relevant sections of the code:\n- The FieldOperation class and its subclasses AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField.\n- The reduce method in each of these classes to understand how they handle reduction of operations.\n- The reduce method in AlterField currently does not handle the case where operation is an AlterField, which aligns with the reported issue.\n\nGiven this, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those related to the AlterField class and its reduce method. Additionally, the MigrationOptimizer class and its optimize method are relevant for understanding the overall optimization process.",
