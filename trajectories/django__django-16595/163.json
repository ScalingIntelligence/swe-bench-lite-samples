The current context does not have any relevant code identified yet. Analyzing the search results, several pieces of code are pertinent to the issue at hand: 1. In django/db/migrations/optimizer.py, the MigrationOptimizer class and its optimize method are central to understanding the optimization process of migration operations. 2. In django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py, several classes are relevant, particularly the AddField and AlterField classes, which handle the addition and alteration of fields in model migrations. The AddField.reduce and AlterField.reduce methods are of special interest here, as they dictate how the optimizer should handle consecutive AddField and AlterField operations. The AlterField.reduce method does not currently check for consecutive AlterField operations, which is a key point of the reported issue. 3. In django/db/migrations/operations/base.py, the Operation class provides the foundational structure for migration operations, and understanding its reduce method is essential to comprehend how operations should be reduced during the optimization process. This analysis identifies critical sections of code related to the migration optimization process and how AlterField operations are currently handled. The task is not yet complete as the search results do not provide a definitive resolution to the issue, particularly the case of nested AlterField operations.

Specifically, the issue notes that when multiple AlterField operations are present, they are not being reduced as expected. This suggests a potential flaw in the reduce method of the AlterField class. The current context provides a detailed view of the AddField and AlterField operations and their respective reduce methods. The search results include the code for FieldOperation, AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField, which are directly relevant to the reported issue. The AlterField.reduce method currently only handles RemoveField and RenameField operations and does not include logic to handle cases where the operation is another AlterField. This aligns with the reported issue's concern that AlterField operations are not being merged. Based on this analysis, updating the AlterField.reduce method to include logic for handling consecutive AlterField operations would address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
