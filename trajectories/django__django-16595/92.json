This concern is supported by the provided sample operations and the expectation that they should be reduced to a single AlterField. Given the file_context indicates no relevant code has been identified yet, the search results provided promise a comprehensive view of the relevant Django migration operations. Specific spans in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file handle the core operations such as AddField, RemoveField, and AlterField, which are instrumental in understanding the current implementation's capability to reduce operations. The AlterField class's 'reduce' method currently only considers specific operation types like RemoveField and RenameField, which matches the observation from the reported issue. This gap might be what causes multiple consecutive AlterField operations not to be reduced. The MigrationOptimizer class's 'optimize' method iterates to reduce operations, but without altering the 'reduce' method of AlterField to recognize other AlterField instances, it cannot complete the optimization as expected by the user. Therefore, these code spans are directly relevant to addressing the issue reported, specifically the logic within the 'reduce' methods of the AddField and AlterField classes.",

This confirms the issue described in the original post. The suggested solution would involve modifying the `reduce` method of `AlterField` to include a check for `AlterField` operations. Additionally, the `optimize_inner` method in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' might need to be inspected to ensure it can handle the results of the modified `reduce` method appropriately. Given the context and the proposal in the issue, the search can be considered complete.",
