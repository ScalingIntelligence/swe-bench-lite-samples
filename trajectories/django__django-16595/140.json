Specifically, the issue arises when these operations are separated, leading to the optimizer not reducing them to a single operation. The proposed solution involves enhancing the AlterField.reduce method to handle instances where the operation is also an AlterField, which aligns with the suggestion in the issue description. The search results provide extensive code related to field and model operations in Django migrations, including the AddField, AlterField, RemoveField, and RenameField classes. These classes are located primarily in the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py files. After reviewing the code, it becomes evident that the current implementation of AlterField.reduce does not handle the case where the operation is another AlterField, which directly correlates with the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans involve the AlterField class's reduce method and potentially the AddField class's reduce method to ensure proper handling of subsequent AlterField operations when AddField is the preceding operation. This analysis confirms that the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue and should be considered for implementation or modification to resolve the issue.",
