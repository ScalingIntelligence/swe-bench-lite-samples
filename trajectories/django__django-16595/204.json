Specifically, the optimizer does not reduce these operations as expected when they are separated from an AddField operation. To address this, it's necessary to examine the `AlterField` and `FieldOperation` classes in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, focusing on the `reduce` method. Additionally, reviewing the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` will help understand the optimization logic applied to migration operations. This search will aim to locate the specific code where the reduction logic for AlterField operations is implemented and potentially identify where an improvement can be made.",

The user observes that if the AddField is separated from the AlterField operations, none of the AlterField operations are reduced. This suggests a possible missing condition in the AlterField.reduce method that prevents it from reducing AlterField operations when preceded by another AlterField operation.\n\nThe search results provide direct evidence related to this issue, specifically in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file. Relevant code spans include:\n- The 'AlterField.reduce' method, which checks for specific kinds of operations but does not handle the case where the operation is another AlterField.\n- The 'AlterField' class definition, which could be relevant for understanding the context in which AlterField operations are reduced.\n- The 'AddField.reduce' method, which correctly reduces subsequent AlterField operations when they follow an AddField operation.\n\nBased on these observations, the issue is indeed relevant to the AlterField.reduce method not handling the reduction of multiple AlterField operations following each other. This suggests a gap in the current implementation and identifies the specific section of code that needs to be modified or extended to handle this case.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the search task is complete and the relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' should be identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

This behavior aligns with the reported issue, which states that the migration optimizer does not reduce multiple `AlterField` operations when they are separated from an `AddField` operation. However, the file context includes a proposed solution within the `AddField` reduce method that checks if an operation is an `AlterField` and performs the appropriate reduction. This suggests that the necessary modifications to address the issue could be made in this file, particularly within the `AlterField` class's `reduce` method to handle the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`.

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
