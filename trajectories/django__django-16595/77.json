            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on the behavior of the Migration Optimizer when dealing with multiple AlterField operations for a model field ('title' in the 'book' model). The issue highlights that when these operations are separated, the optimizer fails to reduce them, leaving multiple AlterField operations in the migration rather than just leaving the AddField or consolidating the AlterFields. \n\nI reviewed the provided search results, which include code spans from two files: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. The 'AlterField' class within 'fields.py' was particularly relevant as it contains the methods '__init__', 'deconstruct', 'state_forwards', 'database_forwards', 'database_backwards', 'describe', 'migration_name_fragment', and 'reduce'. The 'reduce' method is the core function that should handle the merging of successive AlterField operations, but it currently only considers RemoveField and RenameField operations. This behavior directly aligns with the issue's description. \n\nAdditionally, the 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'optimizer.py' contains the 'optimize' and 'optimize_inner' methods that iteratively attempt to optimize the sequence of operations, including AlterField operations. The current implementation, however, does not foresee reducing multiple AlterField operations directly. \n\nTo address the issue, the 'AlterField.reduce' method should be modified to check if the operation is also an AlterField and whether it involves the same field. The suggested addition of the condition 'if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation): return [operation]' could be integrated to handle this specific case. Thus, the relevant code spans from both files were identified to construct a preliminary solution without directly modifying the code. \n\nHowever, further development might be needed to ensure full integration, potentially including detailed error handling and documentation updates as suggested by the issue reporter.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
