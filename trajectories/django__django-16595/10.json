Specifically, the problem occurs when the optimizer fails to reduce multiple AlterField operations into a single operation when there is an initial AddField operation followed by multiple AlterFields. This might be due to the AlterField.reduce method not considering the case where the operation is also an AlterField. To address this, we need to locate the code related to the AlterField class and its reduce method within the Django source code.",
