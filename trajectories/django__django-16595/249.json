Looking at the provided code, we can see that the 'AlterField' class and its methods are part of the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file. There are also relevant methods such as 'is_same_field_operation' which could be used to implement or improve the reduction logic mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' is responsible for optimizing migrations, including reducing multiple 'AlterField' operations. The 'reduce' method in the 'AddField' class could also be modified to handle the scenario described in the issue.

Specifically, the issue is that when migrations containing AddField and subsequent AlterField operations are separated, the optimizer does not reduce the AlterField operations as expected. This is due to the current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method, which does not consider the possibility of reducing AlterField operations when the preceding operation is also an AlterField.\n\nGiven the reported issue, it is essential to identify the relevant code spans within the new search results. Since the issue involves understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of AlterField.reduce, the focus should be on the specific file and spans related to AlterField operations and the reduce method. The file `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` contains the definition of the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method. This file was already identified as relevant based on the file context provided. Additionally, the `AlterField` class and its methods are also defined in the new search results, further reinforcing the relevance of this file and the identified spans.\n\nTo address the issue, the proposed solution suggests adding a condition to the AlterField.reduce method to handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField. This could be implemented by checking if the incoming operation is an instance of `AlterField` and then using the `is_same_field_operation` method to determine if the fields are the same. If they are, the reduce method would return the operation itself, indicating that it can be reduced.\n\nTo implement this feature, the identified relevant spans within the search results are those related to the `AlterField` class, specifically the `reduce` method. The current implementation of the `reduce` method does not handle the case where the operation is another `AlterField`, which is exactly what is proposed to be added.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the proposed solution, the identified relevant spans in the search results are those within the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, including the definitions and the specific methods of the `AlterField` class. The relevant spans are the existing code blocks that define the behavior of AlterField operations in the context of reducing migrations for optimizations.",

Although the `is_same_field_operation` method is defined, it is not utilized within the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class to merge consecutive `AlterField` operations. Additionally, the `FieldOperation` base class, which `AlterField` inherits from, does not have a `reduce` method designed to handle the reduction of `AlterField` instances, which might need to be addressed to fully resolve the issue.

Specifically, the `AlterField` class within `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` shows the implementation of the `reduce` method. This method currently handles reduction with `RemoveField` and `RenameField` but not with another `AlterField`. This confirms the suspicion that consecutive `AlterField` operations are not being reduced, particularly when separated from an `AddField`. Given this, further examinations should target other parts of the Django codebase that might manage optimization strategies or configurations related to field operations and migration optimization.

Specifically, the issue arises when the AddField is separated from the AlterField operations, leading to none of the subsequent AlterField operations being reduced. The issue suggests a potential solution by modifying the `AlterField.reduce` method to include handling for the case where the operation being reduced is also an AlterField. To address this, we need to analyze the relevant code in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` files. The code spans provided in the search results include the `FieldOperation`, `AlterField`, and `MigrationOptimizer` classes, which are directly relevant to the issue at hand. The `AlterField.reduce` method currently does not handle the reduction of AlterField operations themselves, which aligns with the issue description. This suggests that the provided code spans are sufficient to understand and potentially modify to address the reported issue.",

The presence of this class and its `reduce` method makes the file context relevant to the issue at hand. However, the file context alone doesn't provide insight into why this behavior exists (whether it's intentional or not) or whether there might be other parts of the Django codebase that control or influence this behavior.

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
