Specifically, the issue highlights that AlterField operations are not reduced when they occur after an AddField operation, especially when these operations are separated in the migration history. The proposed solution involves enhancing the AlterField.reduce method to consider instances where the operation is also an AlterField.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results and file context, it's evident that the context and search results largely overlap, focusing on the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file. This file contains the definitions and methods for various field-related migration operations such as AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField. The relevant sections in the search results and context are the definitions of these classes and their methods, notably the `reduce` methods for each class.\n\nThe current implementation of the `AlterField.reduce` method does not handle cases where the operation is another AlterField. This aligns with the issue description, which suggests that the behavior is unintended. The proposed enhancement to the `AlterField.reduce` method, which includes a check for AlterField operations and uses the `is_same_field_operation` method, would address this issue.\n\nGiven the analysis, the relevant code span to address the issue is the `AlterField.reduce` method in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file. This method needs to be modified to include a check for instances where the operation is another AlterField.",

The issue suggests that the current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method does not handle the reduction of consecutive AlterField operations when they follow an AddField operation. Instead, the current logic stops reducing once it encounters an AlterField following an AddField. To address this, the user proposes an additional check within the AlterField.reduce method to handle the case where operation is an instance of AlterField. The provided context and search results include the relevant sections of the AlterField class, indicating the current behavior of the reduce method, but do not explicitly include the proposed modification.
