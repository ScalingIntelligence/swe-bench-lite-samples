The issue describes an example where the AddField is separated from the subsequent AlterField operations, resulting in the AlterField operations not being reduced as expected. Since the AddField and AlterField operations are central to this issue, relevant code spans must include those related to these operations in the migration optimizer.\n2. Analyzing the search results, specifically from the file 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', the span 'AlterField.reduce' provides direct insight into how the AlterField operation is currently being reduced in the migration process. Given the issue's focus on this functionality, this span is highly relevant.\n3. The specific scenario mentioned in the issue, where multiple AlterField operations should be reduced after an AddField, is not currently handled by the code in 'AlterField.reduce'. This gap is critical, as it directly addresses the issue raised by the user. Additionally, the 'AddField.reduce' span also highlights how AddField operations are reduced in relation to other field operations, which is also relevant to understanding the broader context of the reported issue.\n4. The key takeaway is that the current reduction logic in 'AlterField.reduce' does not check if the operation being reduced is also an AlterField, which the user suggests might need to be considered for optimizing migrations. This indicates a potential enhancement to the code that could resolve the reported issue.",
