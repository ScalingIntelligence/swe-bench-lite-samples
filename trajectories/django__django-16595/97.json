The optimizer does not reduce AlterField operations if they are separated from an AddField operation. The issue suggests an improvement to the AlterField.reduce method to handle instances where the operation is also an AlterField.\n\nThe search results include two main files: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. The 'fields.py' file contains the definitions and methods for AddField and AlterField operations, specifically the 'reduce' methods for both these operations. The 'optimizer.py' file contains the MigrationOptimizer class with its 'optimize' method. These are directly related to the functionality mentioned in the issue.\n\nBased on the issue, the relevant parts of the code are the 'reduce' methods in the AddField and AlterField classes. The 'AlterField.reduce' method does not currently consider reducing operations of the same type (i.e., another AlterField). This aligns with the issue's concern. Therefore, the relevant spans to identify are the 'AddField.reduce' and 'AlterField.reduce' spans in the 'fields.py' file.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
