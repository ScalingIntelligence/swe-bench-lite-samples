The reported issue points directly to the 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method, as this is where the reduction logic for AlterField operations resides. The provided snippets included both the '__init__' method for initialization of AlterField instances as well as the 'reduce' method for reduction of AlterField operations. The 'reduce' method currently includes specific checks for 'RemoveField' and 'RenameField' operations but does not account for handling consecutive 'AlterField' operations where the field might be the same. This aligns with the user's observation that identical 'AlterField' operations are not being reduced. The user's suggestion to modify the 'reduce' method to consider if the operation is also an 'AlterField' and then check if it's a same-field operation could resolve this issue. This modification would add a new condition to the 'reduce' method making it more robust.",
