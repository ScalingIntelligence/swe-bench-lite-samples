The issue is that when these operations are separated from an AddField operation, they are not reduced as expected. The issue suggests that the AlterField.reduce method might not be considering the case where the operation is also an AlterField, and proposes a potential solution to handle this case. The search results provide the relevant code for the MigrationOptimizer class, specifically the optimize and optimize_inner methods, which are central to the issue. The code is analyzed to identify if it currently handles the scenario described in the issue. From the analysis, it appears that the optimize_inner method iterates through operations and attempts to reduce them, but it does not explicitly handle cases where two AlterField operations are consecutive. This aligns with the issue report that AlterField operations are not reduced as expected when separated from an AddField. Based on the analysis, the code spans related to the MigrationOptimizer class are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
