Specifically, the issue is that the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField operations effectively when they are separated from an AddField operation. This indicates a need to improve the reduction logic in the AlterField class's reduce method.\n\nThe search results provide relevant code spans from `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. The `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file contains the `FieldOperation` class which is the base class for `AddField` and `AlterField` operations. The `AlterField` class's `reduce` method is particularly relevant to the issue, as it currently does not handle the reduction of subsequent AlterField operations appropriately.\n\nThe solution suggested in the issue involves adding a check in the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class to handle the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`, which aligns with the current implementation in the `AddField` class's `reduce` method. This suggests that updating the `AlterField` class's `reduce` method to include a similar check would address the issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans identified are the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. These spans are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the reduction logic to handle multiple AlterField operations more effectively.",
