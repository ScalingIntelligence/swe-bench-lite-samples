Specifically, it notes that when an `AddField` is followed by multiple `AlterField` operations, only the `AddField` is kept after optimization, which is expected. However, when these operations are separated, the `AlterField` operations are not reduced. The issue suggests that the `AlterField.reduce` method should consider cases where the operation is also an `AlterField`.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant sections are within the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, particularly the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method. This method currently only considers `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations but not other `AlterField` operations.\n\nMoreover, the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` is responsible for the optimization process, which could be relevant for understanding the overall behavior.\n\nConsidering the issue's context and the provided code snippets, the relevant code spans are those related to altering fields and the reduction logic in the migrations framework.",
