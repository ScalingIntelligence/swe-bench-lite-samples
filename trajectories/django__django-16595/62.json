This suggests a potential gap in the reduction logic within the 'reduce' method of the AlterField class. The search results provide relevant sections from the codebase, specifically the 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method within the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file, and the 'optimize' and 'optimize_inner' methods from the 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. The current 'reduce' method does handle some specific cases of Field operations but does not account for multiple consecutive AlterField operations that modify the same field. The issue suggests adding a check to consider if the operation is also an AlterField for such cases. Currently, the codebase does not include this specific check. Thus, the relevant code spans are those defining the 'AlterField.reduce' method in 'fields.py' and the 'MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner' method in 'optimizer.py'. These sections are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the reduction logic to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
