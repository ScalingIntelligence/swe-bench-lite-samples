The relevant code appears to be in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, specifically the `AlterField` class, which has a `reduce` method. The optimizer itself is in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`. It seems that the `AlterField.reduce` method may not be handling the scenario where the operation is also an `AlterField`. Given the complexity of the issue, additional investigation into the `reduce` method and the optimizer logic is needed.",

The search results encompass various migration operations such as AddField, AlterField, RemoveField, and RenameField, along with their reduce methods. The key aspect to focus on is the AlterField.reduce method, which currently does not account for the possibility of reducing AlterField operations when they follow each other. The solution suggested in the issue involves adding a check in the AlterField.reduce method to return [operation] if the operation is also an AlterField and the fields are the same. The search results provide the necessary context to understand how these operations interact and potentially where the requested change could be implemented. By examining the code spans in django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py, particularly the `AlterField.reduce` method, we can identify the place where the alteration might be made to address the reported issue.

The search results show that the current implementation of `reduce` only checks for specific conditions, such as `RemoveField` and `RenameField`, which does not address the case where one `AlterField` operation might follow another. This omission is likely causing the issue described. To resolve this, adding a check for `AlterField` operations in the `reduce` method could be necessary.

I analyzed the <search_results> and found relevant sections in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, specifically focusing on the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method. The `reduce` method currently handles reduction for `RemoveField`, `RenameField`, and indirectly through the `is_same_field_operation` method. However, it does not specifically handle the case where the operation is another `AlterField`, which aligns with the problem described in the issue. I identified the necessary span ids from the `fields.py` file related to the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method. Given the nature of the issue, it seems the current implementation does not support reducing multiple `AlterField` operations that are separated from an `AddField` operation. To address this, the suggestion from the issue could be implemented to extend the `reduce` method logic for `AlterField` to handle when the operation is also an `AlterField`.\n\nNo additional files or spans were identified as relevant beyond those already detailed in the context.",
