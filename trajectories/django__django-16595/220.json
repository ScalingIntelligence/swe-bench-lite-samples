This may be due to the AlterField.reduce method not considering instances where the operation is also an AlterField. This suggests a need to examine and possibly modify the reduce method in the AlterField class to handle this case better. Additionally, the MigrationOptimizer class may need to be checked to ensure it correctly optimizes sequences of AlterField operations. Given the context provided, the focus should be on the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file and especially the `AlterField` class, including its `reduce` method, and potentially the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`.",

Additionally, the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method are provided, which is directly related to the issue of reducing multiple AlterField operations. The `reduce` method currently handles specific cases like `RemoveField` and `RenameField`. However, the specific behavior described in the issue, where multiple AlterField operations are not reduced if they are not adjacent to an AddField, suggests that the logic might need to be extended to handle AlterField reducing AlterField. Given the provided context, the relevant code for handling AlterField operations and optimization logic is present, and further investigation into how the `reduce` method can be enhanced to handle the described scenario might be necessary. Since the relevant parts of the codebase are present, it can be considered complete for identifying the current state of the code related to the issue.",
