This suggests a focus on the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` and `FieldOperation` classes, especially where the logic to combine or reduce these operations might be handled. Given the context, the search should concentrate on the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, specifically looking for instances where the `reduce` method is defined or used, and considering if additional logic for reducing `AlterField` operations should be added. The inclusion of `AlterField` in the search parameters is crucial to pinpoint exactly where the optimization logic might be lacking or needing adjustment.",

These classes contain methods such as `is_same_model_operation`, `is_same_field_operation`, and `reduce`, which are critical for determining the behavior of field operations during migration optimization.\n\nSpecifically, the `AlterField` class's `reduce` method does not currently handle the case where the operation is another `AlterField`, which aligns with the issue description.

The current logic in AlterField's reduce only considers RemoveField and RenameField operations, but not other AlterField operations.\n\nThe suggested modification in the issue involves adding a condition to the reduce method to check if operation is an AlterField and if it's the same field, which suggests improvements in the reduction logic.\n\nGiven the search results, I will identify the relevant code spans within the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file that are related to the AlterField operation and its reduction logic.",

The user suggests that the AlterField.reduce method should also consider whether the operation is an AlterField, and proposes adding a condition to handle this case.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant section is the definition of the AlterField class and its methods. Notably, the current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method does not check if the operation is an instance of AlterField. This omission could be the reason why multiple AlterField operations are not being reduced as expected by the user.\n\nThe relevant code spans include the entire AlterField class, focusing especially on the reduce method. This method should be modified to include the proposed condition to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and to return [operation] if the fields being altered are the same. This will ensure that multiple AlterField operations on the same field are reduced to a single operation, which aligns with the user's request for improved behavior.",
