Specifically, the problem is that when an AddField operation is separated from the subsequent AlterField operations, the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField instances as expected. This implies a potential gap in the reduction logic within the AlterField class or in the migration optimizer. Given the context of the issue, it's crucial to identify the specific parts of the codebase where AlterField operations are defined and where the optimization logic is implemented. The goal is to find the place where AlterField operations are reduced and determine if the logic can be enhanced to handle the case when an operation is also an AlterField.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended?
