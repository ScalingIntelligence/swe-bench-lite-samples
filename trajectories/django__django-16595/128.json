The provided file context from 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' contains the core operations AddField, AlterField, and FieldOperation with their respective methods and logic. These operations include the init and reduce methods for each, which handle how operations interact and reduce with others. The main focus seems to be on the 'reduce' method in AlterField, which currently doesn't consider reducing another AlterField immediately following an AddField, which is the specific scenario outlined in the issue.\n\nThe new search results from 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' provide the actual implementation of the MigrationOptimizer class with its 'optimize' and 'optimize_inner' methods. These methods iterate through the operations list and attempt to reduce them. However, as noted in the issue, the current logic doesn't handle multiple AlterField reductions appropriately, tracking changes and optimizing migrations by evaluating and combining operations. This search result confirms the scenario described and the current behavior that fails to reduce multiple AlterField operations effectively when separated from an AddField operation.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the suggested modification to the 'reduce' method in the AlterField class involves adding a condition to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and if it is the same field operation. If so, it should return the operation, indicating it can be reduced. This logic change (if not already present) aims to address the specific issue reported.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue include the 'reduce' methods in both the AddField and AlterField classes, and the 'optimize' and 'optimize_inner' methods in the MigrationOptimizer class.",
