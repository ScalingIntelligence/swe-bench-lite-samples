Additionally, there may be a case for enhancing the optimization logic in the `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` file to better handle sequences of AlterField operations.

This could be the root cause of the issue described. Specifically, the `AlterField.reduce` method does not check for other `AlterField` operations that could potentially be combined or reduced. The `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` method also does not seem to explicitly account for sequences of `AlterField` operations that should be combined. To address this, enhancements to the `AlterField.reduce` method and possibly the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` method may be necessary to better handle and combine multiple `AlterField` operations.",
