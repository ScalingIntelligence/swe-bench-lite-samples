The current behavior of the optimizer does not reduce AlterField operations if they are separated from an AddField operation. The issue suggests adding a check to consider when an operation is also an AlterField in the `AlterField.reduce` method. To address this, I should focus the search on the relevant files that contain the implementation of the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method, as well as the `MigrationOptimizer` class and its `optimize` method. These files are likely to be `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`, and possibly others related to migrations.",

Specifically, it mentions that the Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple consecutive AlterField operations if they are not preceded by an AddField operation. The issue suggests a potential improvement by considering whether an operation is also an AlterField when reducing operations. To address this, we need to focus on the `reduce` method within the `AlterField` class, which is responsible for determining if two operations can be combined or eliminated. By examining the provided search results, particularly the `AlterField` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, we can identify relevant code spans that deal with the reduction of operations. The `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class does not currently handle the case where the operation being reduced is itself an `AlterField`. This omission aligns with the issue reported, making it a relevant part of the codebase to focus on.",
