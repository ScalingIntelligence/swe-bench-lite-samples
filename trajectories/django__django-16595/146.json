This suggests that the 'reduce' method in the 'AlterField' class might not be handling subsequent 'AlterField' operations correctly. This could be due to the absence of specific checks within the 'AlterField.reduce' method, particularly where the operation is also an 'AlterField'. The relevant files include 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py', and possibly 'django/db/migrations/operations/base.py'. Searching within these files for the 'reduce' method in the 'AlterField' class and any related optimization logic should help pinpoint the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue discusses the behavior of the MigrationOptimizer when handling multiple AlterField operations. Specifically, it points out that when these operations are separated from an AddField operation, the optimizer does not reduce the AlterField operations as expected. This could suggest that the AlterField.reduce method does not handle the case where the operation is another AlterField. Given this context, the relevant sections of code to consider are those related to the FieldOperation, AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField classes, particularly their __init__, reduce, and references_field methods. This helps to understand how field operations are initialized, how they interact with each other, and how the optimizer attempts to reduce them. The search results provide the necessary code spans for these operations in the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file. Additionally, the MigrationOptimizer class in django/db/migrations/optimizer.py is crucial for understanding how the optimization process works. These code spans directly address the issue by providing the logic for how field operations are managed and optimized within the migration framework.",
