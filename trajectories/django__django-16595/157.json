Specifically, it seems like the optimizer is not reducing multiple AlterField operations effectively when they are not preceded by an AddField operation. This could be due to the logic in the AlterField.reduce method not considering another AlterField operation as a possible reduction. The files that provide context for this issue are related to migration operations, the migration optimizer, and the schema editor. The AlterField class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' is likely where the issue lies, along with the MigrationOptimizer class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. To address the issue, we should investigate how AlterField.reduce handles other AlterField operations and potentially update the logic to include reductions when the operations are AlterField instances.",

Specifically, the issue points out that the `AlterField.reduce` method does not consider reducing multiple `AlterField` operations when they follow an `AddField` operation. The search results provide relevant context in two files: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. In 'fields.py', the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method are key for understanding the current behavior. The `reduce` method currently handles `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations but does not handle multiple `AlterField` operations as the issue suggests. This aligns with the need to modify the `reduce` method to consider `AlterField` operations. In 'optimizer.py', the `MigrationOptimizer` class and its `optimize` method are relevant as they manage the optimization process. This setup clearly indicates where changes need to be made to enhance the migration optimization behavior by improving the `AlterField.reduce` method.",
