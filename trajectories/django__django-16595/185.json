This suggests a potential gap or bug in the AlterField.reduce method when handling multiple consecutive AlterField operations. The relevant code appears to be in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', particularly the AlterField class and its reduce method. Additionally, 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' will likely need to be reviewed to understand how the optimizer handles these operations. Further, 'django/db/migrations/state.py' and 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' may provide context on how field alterations are handled during migrations.",

Specifically, the issue is that AlterField operations are not being reduced when they should be, especially when they follow an AddField operation. To address this, we need to inspect the relevant parts of the codebase, particularly the reduce method in the AlterField class, to understand how it handles subsequent AlterField operations.\n\nThe search results provide a detailed look into the relevant parts of the codebase. We have the FieldOperation base class, and its subclass, AlterField, which contains the reduce method. This method currently checks for a RemoveField operation but does not consider handling another AlterField operation. Additionally, we have the AddField class, which also has a reduce method that deals with AlterField operations but does not return them as part of the reduction process.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the suggested solution involves modifying the reduce method in the AlterField class to check for and handle instances where the operation is also an AlterField. This would involve adding a condition to the reduce method to handle this specific case.\n\nGiven this context, the relevant code spans are:\n- The 'AlterField.reduce' span where the existing reduction logic for AlterField operations is located.\n- The 'AddField.reduce' span where the logic for reducing AddField operations that are followed by AlterField operations is found.\n\nThese spans are crucial as they directly deal with the operations mentioned in the issue and would need to be modified to address the reported behavior.",
