Specifically, it notes that when AlterField operations are separated from an AddField operation, they are not reduced as expected. This suggests a potential issue in the AlterField.reduce method, which does not currently handle the case where operation is also an AlterField.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, I focus on the `AlterField.reduce` method in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. The current implementation checks for removal or renaming of fields but does not include a case for reducing consecutive AlterField operations into a single operation. This aligns with the user's observation and the proposed solution to handle AlterField within the reduce method.\n\nAdditionally, the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize` method in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` is relevant as it is the method responsible for the optimization process. Understanding how this method interacts with individual operation types is crucial for addressing the issue.\n\nGiven these points, the identified relevant code spans are those within the `AlterField.reduce` method which should be adjusted to consider AlterField operations among themselves.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
