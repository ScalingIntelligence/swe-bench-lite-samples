According to the description, when these AlterField operations are separated from an AddField operation, they are not being reduced or optimized as expected. This suggests a potential issue in the reduce method of the AlterField class or in the optimization logic that processes these operations. To investigate this, it would be beneficial to closely look at the specific reduce method implementations for AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField in the FieldOperation class, as well as the overall optimization logic in the MigrationOptimizer class. Additionally, examining the logic in the reduce method of the AlterField class might reveal why it does not handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField, which could be the root cause of the issue described.",

The issue specifically mentions the lack of reduction for AlterField operations when an AddField operation is not present at the start. The search results include several key code spans within the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, which defines various field operations like AddField, AlterField, RemoveField, and RenameField, alongside their reduce methods. The AlterField.reduce method currently does not consider reducing consecutive AlterField operations into a single operation, which aligns with the issue's description. Also relevant is the AddField.reduce method, which demonstrates how it handles other field operations but does not explicitly manage altering the same field consecutively. Addressing this issue likely involves modifying the AlterField.reduce method to consider reducing consecutive AlterField operations into a single one, similar to how AddField operations are handled in the provided example. This change might involve adding a check within the AlterField.reduce method to compare the incoming operation with itself, if it's another AlterField operation, and then decide how to reduce or merge these operations. The MigrationOptimizer class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' is responsible for optimizing the list of operations, but the specific logic for handling field operations across different types is defined within the field operations themselves.",

The provided file context includes the relevant code for FieldOperation, AddField, and AlterField classes along with their reduce methods. The new search results add the is_same_field_operation method, which checks if two field operations are the same based on the model and field name. The issue suggests that the AlterField.reduce method should recognize when the operation is also an AlterField to merge or reduce them. This functionality is not currently present in the provided code spans. Thus, the provided search results are relevant as they reveal the missing logic in the AlterField.reduce method to handle consecutive AlterField operations.
