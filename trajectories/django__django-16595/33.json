This suggests a potential gap in the reduce method in the AlterField class, implying that it doesn't handle subsequent AlterField operations correctly. To address this, we should focus our search on files that contain the AlterField and MigrationOptimizer classes, specifically looking for the reduce methods in these classes to identify if and how they handle consecutive AlterField operations. Additionally, we should look for any documentation or comments that might explain the intended behavior or possible gaps that need to be addressed.",

The issue suggests modifying the AlterField.reduce method to consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField. The search results include code spans from `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` which contains the definitions and methods for `AddField` and `AlterField`. The `AddField.reduce` method already handles reducing AlterField operations by replacing them with an AddField operation representing the final state. However, the `AlterField.reduce` method does not currently consider reducing consecutive AlterField operations. The issue implies that adding a check for AlterField in the `AlterField.reduce` method could help address this. Reviewing the code shows that altering the `AlterField.reduce` method as suggested could potentially resolve the issue. The relevant code spans are in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, specifically the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method, which might need to be adjusted to add this functionality.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
