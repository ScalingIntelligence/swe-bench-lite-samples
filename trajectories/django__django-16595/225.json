The current implementation does not reduce subsequent AlterField operations when an AddField is separated, which seems to be a behavior that could be improved. Following the issue description, it would be beneficial to check the `FieldOperation.reduce`, `AddField.reduce`, and `AlterField.reduce` methods to see if they handle instances where the operation is also an AlterField. It is also noted that currently, in `AlterField.reduce`, there is a condition to return `[operation]` if the operation is an `AlterField` and the field operations are the same, followed by additional conditions for `RemoveField`, `RenameField`, etc. Analyzing the provided search results, especially the `AlterField.reduce` method and related classes and methods, seems crucial to determine if a reduction in AlterField operations is currently handled or if an improvement is needed to handle such cases more effectively. Thus, I will focus on identifying relevant code in these methods and making a decision on whether search task is complete based on the relevant spans found.",

From the provided file context, it's evident that the AlterField class does not currently consider reducing consecutive AlterField operations within the reduce method. The optimizer logic also seems focused on other scenarios, potentially missing the case where multiple AlterField operations need consolidation.

After analyzing the provided code, it's evident that the relevant code spans reside within the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file. The specific sections of interest include the definition of the AlterField class and its reduce method. Additionally, the AddField class and its reduce method are crucial, as they interact directly with AlterField. Given that the issue pertains to the optimizer, the `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` file is also relevant, particularly the MigrationOptimizer class and its optimize method.

The method iterates over each operation and tries to reduce it with subsequent operations. If a reduction is possible, it replaces the original operations with the reduced set. Otherwise, it adds the original operation to the new list.
