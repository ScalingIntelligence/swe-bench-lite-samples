The optimizer does not reduce these operations as expected, particularly when the AddField operation is separated from the subsequent AlterField operations. This might be due to the AlterField.reduce method not considering the case where the operation is also an AlterField. To address this, it's suggested to enhance the reduce method to handle such cases. The relevant files appear to be django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py and django/db/migrations/optimizer.py. Searching specifically in these files will help identify the necessary code spans to debug and potentially fix this issue.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
