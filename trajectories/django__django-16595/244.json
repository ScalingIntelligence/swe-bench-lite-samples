This is important because the reduce method is where the optimizer would attempt to combine or eliminate operations. Based on the issue, it seems like improving the AlterField.reduce method to handle AlterField instances might resolve the user's issue.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file under the `AlterField` class, especially the `AlterField.reduce` method.
