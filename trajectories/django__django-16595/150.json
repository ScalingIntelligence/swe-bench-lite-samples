Specifically, the issue points out that when there are multiple AlterField operations on the same field in sequence, they are not being optimized into a single operation. Instead, they remain as separate AlterField operations. The user suggests a potential solution by adding a check in the AlterField.reduce method to consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField and then return the operation instead of the usual super().reduce call.\n\nI have reviewed the relevant sections of the code in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` where the AlterField class is defined, including its reduce method. The current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method does not consider reducing AlterField operations amongst themselves. It only handles removing fields, renaming fields and reducing through super calls.\n\nAdditionally, I looked at the `AddField.reduce` method, which handles reducing operations for AddField, but it specifies no direct reduction handling for AlterField other than returning an AddField to a newly specified field in an AlterField.\n\nBased on the issue description and the existing code analysis, the relevant code spans identified are those within the `AlterField` class, particularly the `AlterField.reduce` method as well as the code around operations like AddField, RemoveField, and RenameField that could interact with or affect the behavior of the AlterField operation during optimization.\n\nGiven that the issue specifically refers to the reduction of multiple AlterField operations, the most direct and relevant code to consider is the `AlterField.reduce` method, as modifying this method can address the reported issue. The suggestion provided by the user is to add a new condition within this method to recognize and handle the optimization of subsequent AlterField operations on the same field.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
