The user has observed that the current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method does not handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField, leading to non-reduction of multiple AlterField operations in certain scenarios. This issue specifically points out the need for the AlterField.reduce method to consider instances of AlterField to potentially reduce the operations further.\n\nIn examining the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are found within the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file. Specifically, the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method are critical to solving the problem. The existing `reduce` method in `AlterField` does not currently check if the operation is an instance of `AlterField`, which is the exact issue described. The proposed solution suggests adding a check for `isinstance(operation, AlterField)` and comparing the fields to determine if reduction can occur.\n\nThe `AddField` class and its `reduce` method are also relevant, as they provide a template for how `reduce` could potentially handle different types of operations. Similarly, understanding how `RemoveField` and `RenameField` are handled within their respective `reduce` methods provides context on how different operations are currently being optimized.\n\nGiven the search results and the focus of the issue, the identified code spans in `AlterField` and `AddField` classes are relevant. These spans include the existing `reduce` methods and other related attributes that can inform how to modify the `AlterField.reduce` method to address the issue. Other class definitions like `RemoveField` and `RenameField` offer insight into how different field operations are handled but are not directly involved in solving the issue at hand.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
