            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the behavior of the `AlterField` operation in Django migrations and the optimizer's inability to reduce multiple `AlterField` operations when they are separated from an `AddField` operation. This suggests a need to inspect the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file to understand how it processes subsequent `AlterField` operations. Additionally, the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` should be examined to see how it handles operation optimization. The provided code snippets indicate that the `AlterField.reduce` method does not currently consider the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`, which may be contributing to the observed behavior. The solution might involve modifying the `reduce` method to handle such cases, potentially by adding a check for `AlterField` operations and ensuring they are processed appropriately.",
