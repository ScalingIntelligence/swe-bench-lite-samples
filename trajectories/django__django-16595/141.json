            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on the optimization of consecutive `AlterField` operations within Django's migration process. Specifically, it points out that the current `AlterField.reduce` method does not handle the reduction of multiple `AlterField` operations when they follow an `AddField` operation in a migrations list, which could lead to redundant database operations. The current context and search results provide insights into how `AlterField` and other field operations in Django handle reduction and optimization.\n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant code spans were identified:-\n- The `AlterField` class definition and its `reduce` method in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, which currently checks for `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations but does not check for other `AlterField` instances.\n- The `AddField` class with its `reduce` method also in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, which handles reduction with `AlterField`, `RemoveField`, and `RenameField` operations but does not mention consecutive `AlterField` optimization.\n- Other related operations like `RemoveField`, `RenameField`, and their respective `reduce` methods were found, providing context for how various field operations interact in the reduction process.\n\nGiven the issue's focus on optimizing multiple `AlterField` operations and the current implementation's omission of checking for other `AlterField` in its reduce method, it makes sense to identify the `AlterField.reduce` method as the most pertinent code span. This would allow for potential modifications to include the suggested optimization, which checks if an operation is also an `AlterField` and handles it accordingly. Such an addition could potentially eliminate redundant database operations during migrations.\n\nThe analysis concludes that while the current implementation does not cater to the issue of reducing multiple `AlterField` operations effectively, the provided code spans and logic in the context offer a clear point of entry for suggesting improvements or modifications to the Django migration optimizer.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
