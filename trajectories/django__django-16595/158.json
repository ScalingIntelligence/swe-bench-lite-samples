It seems that the current implementation does not consolidate these AlterField operations effectively if they are not immediately following an AddField operation. This could lead to redundant database operations and potential performance issues. The provided code snippets suggest the presence of a 'reduce' method in relevant classes like AlterField and AddField that might be responsible for consolidating these operations. A potential solution is to enhance the 'reduce' method within the AlterField class to consider instances where the operation is also an AlterField, thus merging consecutive AlterField operations more effectively.",

The file context includes the implementation of these operations, and notably, the AlterField class indeed lacks handling for consecutive AlterField operations within its 'reduce' method. This suggests that the core functionality required to address the reported issue is present, but specific logic to handle consecutive AlterField cases is missing, as the reduce method in AlterField only checks for RemoveField or RenameField operations.

The issue specifically points out that the current implementation of `AlterField.reduce` does not consider the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`. This results in multiple `AlterField` operations not being reduced or optimized when separated from an `AddField`. The proposed solution suggests adding a condition to check if the operation is an instance of `AlterField` and if it is the same field operation using `self.is_same_field_operation(operation)`. The search results include the complete `AlterField` class with its `__init__`, `reduce`, and other methods, which allows for a thorough understanding of its current behavior and how it interacts with other operations.",
