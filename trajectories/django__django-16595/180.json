Specifically, the issue mentions that the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField operations into a single AlterField, which could be optimized. The provided search results include code spans from three files: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py', and 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py'. In 'fields.py', the relevant code spans are those defining the 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method. The current 'reduce' method does not consider reducing one AlterField into another, which aligns with the issue described in the reported problem. The 'optimizer.py' file is also relevant as it contains the 'MigrationOptimizer' class with its 'optimize' and 'optimize_inner' methods, which handle the optimization of migrations. Finally, the 'autodetector.py' file is less directly relevant to the issue, as it deals with the automatic detection of changes to be migrated rather than the optimization of these changes. The key code spans identified are those in the 'AlterField' class in 'fields.py' and the 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'optimizer.py'.",
