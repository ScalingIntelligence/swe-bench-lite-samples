Upon examining the search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans pertain to the AlterField class and its methods, such as __init__, deconstruct, state_forwards, database_forwards, database_backwards, describe, migration_name_fragment, and reduce. These methods are crucial as they define how AlterField operations are handled in migrations. The reduce method in the AlterField class currently only considers RemoveField and RenameField operations for reduction, and does not handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField, which seems to be the cause of the issue. This aligns with the proposed solution in the reported issue, suggesting that updating the reduce method to also consider AlterField operations might resolve the problem. Additionally, the MigrationOptimizer class and its optimize and optimize_inner methods are relevant as they orchestrate the optimization process for migration operations. Overall, the identified code spans cover the necessary methods and logic related to handling AlterField operations and optimizing migrations.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
