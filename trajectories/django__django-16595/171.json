The problem is that multiple consecutive AlterField operations on the same field are not being reduced, even when they should be logically combined. The focus should be on the reduce method within the AlterField class and possibly the MigrationOptimizer class to ensure that these operations are optimized as expected. It might also be beneficial to check the FieldOperation class for any related logic affecting this behavior. Given the provided context, the search should target specific methods and classes involved in migration operations and optimization.",

Specifically, it notes that the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField operations when they follow an AddField operation in certain scenarios. The issue suggests modifying the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class to consider cases where the operation being reduced is also an `AlterField`. To address this, I analyzed the provided search results for relevant code spans. I identified several key sections in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, particularly the `FieldOperation`, `AlterField`, and `AddField` classes and their methods. These sections include the `AlterField.reduce` method and the `AddField.reduce` method, which currently handle reductions differently depending on the type of operation they encounter. I also looked at the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` to understand how operations are optimized in general. The identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly concern the handling of field operations and their reductions during migration optimization.",

The current reduce method in the AlterField class only considers the cases where the operation is an instance of RemoveField or RenameField, but it does not handle the scenario where the operation is another AlterField. This causes multiple AlterField operations to remain unreduced, which is the main concern. Analyzing the provided code and search results, it's clear that the AlterField.reduce method needs to be updated to consider instances of AlterField, similar to the proposed solution. The new code should include a check to see if the operation is an AlterField and if it is a similar field operation before processing it. The search results confirm the presence of the necessary methods and classes such as FieldOperation, AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField, which are relevant to the issue at hand.

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
