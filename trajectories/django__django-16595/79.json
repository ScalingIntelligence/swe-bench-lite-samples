Specifically, when an AddField operation is separated from subsequent AlterField operations (e.g., due to a non-elidable migration or within a non-squashed migration), the AlterField operations are not reduced as expected. This suggests that the AlterField.reduce method currently does not account for the case where the operation is another AlterField instance. To address this, we need to identify where the reduce method for AlterField operations is implemented (django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py) and potentially update it to consider reducing multiple consecutive AlterField operations.",

Through detailed analysis, I found that the AddField and AlterField classes both have reduce methods that handle operations similarly, but they do not currently check if the operation is also an AlterField. This aligns with the issue's suggestion that there is a missed opportunity to reduce multiple AlterField operations. The relevant code spans include the reduce methods of AddField and AlterField classes, which are responsible for reducing operations in the migration process. The proposed solution in the issue suggests adding a condition to the reduce method of AlterField to allow it to reduce another AlterField operation. This change would likely be relevant to address the issue. Thus, the identified code spans provide the necessary context to understand and potentially resolve the reported problem.",
