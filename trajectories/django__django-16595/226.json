The problem arises when these AlterField operations are not reduced as expected when separated from the AddField operation.

The current behavior does not reduce subsequent `AlterField` operations when `AddField` is separated from `AlterField`, indicating a potential issue in the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class. The provided search results include the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, which contains the `AlterField` class definition with its `reduce` method. This method currently only handles reduction against `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations but does not consider handling other `AlterField` operations, which aligns with the issue described. Additionally, the `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` file contains the `MigrationOptimizer` class with its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods, which are responsible for optimizing migration operations. These methods do not specifically handle the case where multiple `AlterField` operations should be reduced, supporting the need for the proposed enhancement. The identified relevant code spans include the `AlterField` class, particularly the `reduce` method, and the `MigrationOptimizer` class's `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods. This analysis confirms that the current implementation does not handle reduction of adjacent `AlterField` operations and suggests that the addition of a check for `AlterField` operations within the `reduce` method could address the issue.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
