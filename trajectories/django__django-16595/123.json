The issue suggests that the AlterField.reduce method might need to be enhanced to consider instances where the operation is also an AlterField.\n\nIn examining the provided search results from 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', I identified several relevant sections of code.

The 'reduce' method currently handles the reduction for RemoveField and RenameField operations but does not handle AlterField operations. This omission seems to align with the user's concern, indicating that this code span is highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, it is clear that the 'reduce' method within the 'AlterField' class is the primary area of focus for addressing the user's issue.

The suggested solution is to enhance the `reduce` method within the `AlterField` class to consider reducing multiple AlterField operations when they modify the same field. The current context and search results show the `AlterField` class and its methods, including the `reduce` method, which currently only reduces operations when they are of type `RemoveField` or `RenameField`. There is no condition to handle reducing multiple AlterField operations. The search results also contain the definition of the `FieldOperation` class and its methods, including the `is_same_field_operation` method, which is crucial for determining if two operations modify the same field.
