The issue suggests that the AlterField.reduce method should consider cases where the operation is also an AlterField, potentially adding logic to handle this situation. The search results provide insights into the FieldOperation class, specifically the AddField and AlterField classes, which are directly relevant to the issue at hand. The AddField.reduce method already contains logic for handling AlterField operations, but the same logic is not present in the AlterField.reduce method. This discrepancy is what the issue aims to address. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the reduce method within the AddField and AlterField classes.\n\nThe identified relevant code spans include:\n1. AddField.reduce for understanding how AddField operations interact with AlterField.\n2.

The user suggests enhancing the AlterField.reduce method to consider when the operation is also an AlterField, proposing to add a condition to handle this case. Analyzing the provided code, especially the classes AddField and AlterField in django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py, shows the current implementation of the reduce methods for these classes. The AddField.reduce method currently handles reductions for AlterField, RemoveField, and RenameField operations, but the AlterField.reduce method does not consider other AlterField operations for reduction. This analysis aligns with the user's issue, suggesting a gap in the current implementation where consecutive AlterField operations are not reduced, which could be addressed by modifying the AlterField.reduce method as suggested.",

The user observed that when AddField operations are separated from AlterField operations due to non-elidable migrations, the AlterField operations are not reduced as expected. This behavior seems to indicate a limitation in the current implementation of the reduce method in the AlterField class. The user suggested a potential enhancement to the reduce method to better handle adjacent AlterField operations.\n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant code spans were identified in django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py. These spans include the definition of the AlterField class, its reduce method, and the ReduceField method. Other relevant spans include the FieldOperation class and its reduce method, which AlterField inherits from.\n\nGiven the user's suggestion about handling AlterField operations similarly to FieldOperation, it is relevant to modify the reduce method of the AlterField class by adding a condition to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and call the is_same_field_operation method.\n\nAdditionally, while not directly related to the AlterField reduction issue, the other parts of the codebase such as the optimizer and base operation classes provide a broader context for understanding how migrations are managed in Django. This analysis concludes that the appropriate place to implement the suggested change is in the reduce method of the AlterField class within django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
