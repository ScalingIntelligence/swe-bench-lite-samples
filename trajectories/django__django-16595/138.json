            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the migration optimizer regarding multiple AlterField operations. Specifically, the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField operations when they follow an AddField operation, especially when separated. The issue suggests that the AlterField.reduce method might need to handle instances where the operation is also an AlterField. This would involve checking if the operation is an instance of AlterField and if it's the same field operation using a method like is_same_field_operation.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file, particularly within the AlterField class. The __init__ method initializes the AlterField operation, while the reduce method is where the optimization logic should be implemented. Currently, the reduce method handles RemoveField and RenameField operations but does not handle AlterField operations. This aligns with the issue's suggestion of potentially adding a condition to handle AlterField within AlterField.reduce.\n\nAnother relevant file is 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py', specifically the optimize method in the MigrationOptimizer class. This method is responsible for the overall optimization process, which involves repeatedly applying optimization until no further changes are made. This context helps understand the broader framework in which the AlterField.reduce method operates.\n\nGiven the code analysis, the relevant code spans directly relate to the reported issue by providing the context and method where the optimization logic should be adjusted to handle multiple AlterField operations.",

Specifically, it points out that the current implementation of `AlterField.reduce` does not consider the case where the previous operation is also an `AlterField`. This leads to unnecessary multiple `AlterField` operations being retained in the migration history, instead of being optimized out.\n\nIn the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are:\n1. The `AlterField.reduce` method in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, which is responsible for consolidating migration operations. The current implementation only handles `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations, and does not consider consecutive `AlterField` operations.\n2. The `MigrationOptimizer.optimize` method in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`, which is responsible for optimizing the sequence of migration operations. Understanding how this method interacts with individual operation types like `AlterField` is crucial for addressing the issue.\n\nTo address the issue, it would be beneficial to enhance the `AlterField.reduce` method to consider and potentially consolidate consecutive `AlterField` operations, similar to the suggestion in the issue description. This would involve adding a condition to the `reduce` method to check if the operation is an instance of `AlterField` and if it is the same field being altered.",

This suggests a potential shortcoming in the current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method, which does not account for reducing subsequent AlterField operations into a single operation. The provided code spans show the current implementation of the reduce method in the AlterField class, which checks for RemoveField and RenameField but does not check for other AlterField instances. This aligns with the user's suggestion to add a check for AlterField instances within the reduce method.
