The key problem is that the AlterField.reduce method does not consider the case where the operation being reduced is also an AlterField. This leads to multiple AlterField operations not being optimized as expected when the AddField operation is separated from the AlterField operations. To address this, it might be necessary to modify the reduction logic within the AlterField class to account for other AlterField operations.",

After analyzing the search results, I found relevant sections in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py and django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py. In particular, the AlterField and AddField classes are of interest. The `reduce` method within the AlterField class does not currently check if the operation is an instance of AlterField, which might be where the optimization would need to happen based on the suggested solution. \n\nIn the AlterField.reduce method, there is a condition to check for RemoveField and RenameField operations, but not AlterField. This might be missing optimization logic.\n\nAlso, the AddField.reduce method shows how AddField interacts with other field operations. These methods need to be reviewed for potential improvements related to optimization logistic\n\nGiven this information, I will select the relevant spans for further investigation and potential implementation of the suggested optimization.",

The provided search results include relevant sections of the `AlterField` class in the `fields.py` file, which is crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the existing reduction logic. The `AlterField.reduce` method is where the logic for reducing operations is defined, and it currently does not handle the case where an operation is also an `AlterField`. Integrating the suggested logic into this method could address the issue by considering consecutive `AlterField` operations and possibly reducing them. The current context does not include any relevant files from a previous search, indicating that this is likely the first search for this issue.

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
