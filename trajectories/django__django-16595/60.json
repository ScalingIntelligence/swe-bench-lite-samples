Specifically, the issue is that when multiple AlterField operations are present, the optimizer does not reduce them as expected. The issue suggests that the AlterField.reduce method should consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField. \n\nReviewing the provided search results, it's clear that the codebase includes the AlterField class and its methods. Notably, the `reduce` method within the AlterField class does not currently handle the case where the operation is an instance of AlterField. This omission is likely the cause of the optimizer not reducing multiple AlterField operations.\n\nThe search results also include the MigrationOptimizer class and its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods. These methods are responsible for optimizing the migration operations, but they rely on the individual operations' `reduce` methods to perform any necessary reductions. Since the AlterField.reduce method does not handle the AlterField case, the optimizer fails to reduce multiple AlterField operations.\n\nTo address the issue, it would be necessary to modify the AlterField.reduce method to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and then handle it accordingly. This modification would align with the suggestion in the reported issue, which is to add a check for AlterField in the reduce method and handle it if it's the same field operation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue are within the AlterField class, specifically the `reduce` method and other methods involved in the AlterField operation process.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
