The key files identified are likely to contain the relevant code: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` for defining field operations like AddField and AlterField, `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` for the optimizer logic itself, and potentially `django/db/migrations/state.py` for state management during migrations. The specific function of interest is `reduce` within the AlterField class, as it needs to account for reducing AlterField operations with preceding AlterField operations. Specifying `class_names` and `function_names` can help narrow down the search to specific implementations.",

The first file contains the definition of the AlterField class and its reduce method, which currently does not handle reducing AlterField operations if the previous operation is also an AlterField. This aligns with the suggested improvement in the issue description. The second file contains the MigrationOptimizer class, which is likely where the optimization logic is implemented, although the specific method mentioned in the issue (optimize) does not seem to directly address the AlterField reduction issue.

The user has observed that if `AddField` and `AlterField` operations are separated (e.g., due to a non-elidable migration), the `AlterField` operations are not reduced as expected. The user suggests adding a condition in `AlterField.reduce` to handle instances where the operation is also an `AlterField`. The provided file context and search results contain the relevant code for `AlterField` and its methods, including `__init__` and `reduce`. The current implementation of `AlterField.reduce` does not consider reducing `AlterField` operations if they follow another `AlterField`. This aligns with the user's issue, as the described behavior (no reduction of `AlterField` operations) matches the current implementation. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",

The provided context and search results include relevant sections of the codebase, particularly focusing on the 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method. The 'reduce' method currently handles scenarios with 'RemoveField' and 'RenameField', but not with another 'AlterField'. The user suggests adding a condition to handle such scenarios. The search results confirm the existence of the 'AlterField' class and its methods, including 'reduce', and also show other relevant classes like 'AddField' and 'RemoveField'. This information is sufficient to understand the current behavior of the 'AlterField' class and identify the missing condition described in the issue.
