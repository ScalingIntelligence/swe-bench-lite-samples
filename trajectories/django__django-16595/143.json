The issue specifically points out that the AlterField.reduce method does not consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField, leading to multiple AlterField operations not being reduced when they should be. This suggests that the relevant code spans would be within the implementation of the AlterField class and its reduce method. I also considered the MigrationOptimizer class and its optimize method, as this is where the optimization logic is applied to the operations. After reviewing the provided search results, I focused on the following spans: 1. The 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', as this is where the logic for reducing AlterField operations is implemented. 2. The 'MigrationOptimizer' class and its 'optimize' method in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py', as this is where the overall optimization process is controlled.",
