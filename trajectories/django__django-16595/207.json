Specifically, when multiple AlterField operations are present without an intervening AddField, they should ideally be reduced to a single AlterField operation. However, the current implementation does not handle this case as expected. The key question is whether the AlterField.reduce method should consider reducing other AlterField operations immediately following an AddField. The provided search results include relevant code spans from Django's migration operations module, particularly focusing on the AddField, AlterField, and RemoveField classes. Notably, the AlterField.reduce method currently only considers RemoveField and RenameField operations for reduction, but it does not handle the case where the operation is another AlterField, which seems to be the core issue described. This omission could be addressed by modifying the AlterField.reduce method to handle consecutive AlterField operations, as suggested in the issue description.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
