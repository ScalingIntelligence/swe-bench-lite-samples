The issue suggests that the AlterField.reduce method does not currently handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField, leading to multiple AlterField operations not being reduced. To address this, the issue proposes a modification to the AlterField.reduce method by adding a check for isinstance(operation, AlterField) and then returning [operation] if it is true. \n\nBased on this, I analyzed the search results and identified two key files that are relevant: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. Within 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', the relevant code spans include the existing AlterField.reduce method and its related class AlterField, as well as the AddField.reduce method which shows how similar operations are currently handled. These spans are crucial for understanding how the Reduce logic works for similar field operations. Additionally, the optimizer file is relevant to understand the higher-level context and how the optimize function iterates over operations. \n\nThe identified code spans in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' will provide insights into the current behavior of the Reduce method for field operations and how it might be modified to address the issue. The 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' file provides context on how the optimization of migrations is managed, which is also relevant to understand the issue fully.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
