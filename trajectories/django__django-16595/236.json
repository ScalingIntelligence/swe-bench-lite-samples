The issue clearly states that the optimizer fails to reduce multiple `AlterField` operations when they are not preceded by an `AddField` operation. This suggests that the reduction logic in `AlterField.reduce` method does not currently handle the case where the operation being reduced is also an `AlterField`. The provided code snippets from `fields.py` and `optimizer.py` show the existing logic. Notably, the `AlterField.reduce` method checks for `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations but not for other `AlterField` operations. This confirms the missing piece. The search results include the relevant parts of the codebase, specifically the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method in `fields.py`, and the `MigrationOptimizer` class with its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods in `optimizer.py`. These code spans are crucial for understanding the current behavior and implementing any necessary changes to address the reported issue. Based on the issue description, it seems reasonable to extend the `reduce` method in `AlterField` to also handle reducing another `AlterField` operation if they are for the same field, as suggested in the issue. This would involve adding a condition to check for `AlterField` type and then using a helper method to compare the fields, similar to how other operations are handled.",

From the provided context, the AlterField.reduce method currently handles reductions with RemoveField and RenameField operations, but it doesn't optimize different instances of AlterField operations with the same field. This oversight can lead to longer and more redundant migration histories, increasing the complexity of database migrations and potentially leading to errors during the application of those migrations. Expanding the AlterField.reduce method to handle subsequent AlterField operations could streamline migrations significantly, but it will also require careful consideration and testing to ensure it doesn't introduce new bugs or incompatibility issues. Additionally, examining how the MigrationOptimizer class evaluates and processes operations might reveal other opportunities for optimizing AlterField operations, contributing to a more efficient and robust migration process overall.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
