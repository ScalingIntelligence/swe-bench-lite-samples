The issue describes a specific scenario where multiple AlterField operations are not being reduced as expected when they follow an AddField operation. This suggests that the reduction logic within the AlterField.reduce method might not be considering AlterField operations that precede it. The provided search results contain relevant code spans within both the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/state.py' files. The 'AlterField.reduce' method in 'fields.py' currently does not handle the reduction of multiple AlterField operations, which seems to be the core of the issue. Additionally, the 'AddField.reduce' method in the same file also does not directly handle AlterField operations despite being related to field addition. The code in 'state.py' provides context on how the state of the project is managed during migrations, but it does not directly address the issue of AlterField reduction. Based on this analysis, the most relevant code spans are those within the 'AlterField.reduce' and 'AddField.reduce' methods in 'fields.py', as these directly relate to the issue at hand.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
