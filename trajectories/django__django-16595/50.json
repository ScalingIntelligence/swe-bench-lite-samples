It seems that the current implementation of the reduce method in the AlterField class does not handle instances where the previous operation is also an AlterField. This might lead to non-optimized migrations when AddField operations are separated from AlterField operations. To address this, the code might need modifications in the reduce method of the AlterField class. The relevant files identified in the context include django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py, which contains the AlterField class, and django/db/migrations/optimizer.py, which is responsible for migration optimization. A possible solution might involve updating the reduce method in the AlterField class to handle consecutive AlterField operations more effectively.",

The current behavior of the optimizer does not reduce consecutive AlterField operations when separated from an AddField operation, which is not the expected behavior. The solution proposed involves enhancing the AlterField.reduce method to consider overlapping AlterField operations for reduction.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, we find:\n\n1. **django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py**: This file contains definitions for various field operations including AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField. The AlterField class has a 'reduce' method that currently does not consider if the operation is also an AlterField, which aligns with the reported issue.\n\n2. **django/db/migrations/optimizer.py**: This file defines the MigrationOptimizer class, which includes methods for optimizing migration operations. The 'optimize' method iterates through operations to attempt to reduce them, and it uses the 'reduce' methods defined in the operations like AlterField to attempt reductions.\n\nGiven this context, the relevant code spans are in AlterField's 'reduce' method within 'fields.py' as this is where the logic for reducing operations is defined and where the proposal suggests adding new logic to handle consecutive AlterField operations. The proposal suggests enhancing the reduce function by checking if the operation is an instance of AlterField and then deciding whether to reduce it, which could be implemented around the 'AlterField.reduce' span.\n\nBy implementing the changes as proposed near the 'AlterField.reduce' span, we can address the issue of not reducing consecutive AlterField operations effectively.",

This suggests an improvement in the AlterField.reduce method to handle AlterField operations more efficiently. The provided search results include the relevant code spans for FieldOperation, AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField classes. The specific span of interest is the current implementation of AlterField.reduce, which does not consider the case where operation is an AlterField. This aligns with the suggested improvement in the issue description. The search results also contain other relevant related operations and their reduce methods, which could be leveraged for a more comprehensive understanding and potential enhancement.

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
