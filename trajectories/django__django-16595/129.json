The user observes that multiple AlterField operations are not reduced as expected when the AddField is separated from the AlterField operations. This suggests a potential oversight or bug in the reduction logic within the AlterField class. Based on the file context, it is clear that the relevant code is likely within the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file, specifically within the methods of the AlterField class, as well as potentially in the MigrationOptimizer class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. Understanding and possibly modifying the 'reduce' method in both AlterField and FieldOperation classes could be necessary to address this issue. Additionally, any changes to how operations are optimized in the MigrationOptimizer class may also be relevant.",

This issue is particularly relevant in the context of handling migrations, especially when dealing with fields that have multiple alterations chained together. The search results show various parts of the `FieldOperation`, `AddField`, `RemoveField`, `AlterField`, and `RenameField` classes within Django's migration operations. It's crucial to identify the `reduce` methods in these classes since optimizing migrations heavily relies on how these methods interact. The provided code spans indeed show these methods, including `FieldOperation.reduce` and `AlterField.reduce`, which are critical for understanding and potentially modifying the reduction behavior of these operations. The current `AlterField.reduce` method only considers instances of `RemoveField` and `RenameField` and does not account for other `AlterField` operations, which could be the underlying cause of the reported issue. This analysis indicates that the relevant code spans are those that define the `reduce` methods for `AlterField` and potentially also for `AddField`, as understanding their current implementation is key to addressing the issue. Based on the Issue's suggestion for enhancing `AlterField.reduce` to handle multiple `AlterField` operations, the current code clearly does not account for this, making these spans the focus for potential improvements and bug fixing.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
