This implies a need to adjust how AlterField operations are reduced to handle the case where an AlterField operation encounters another AlterField operation. The current implementation in `AlterField.reduce` does not handle this specific case. The search results include relevant code spans from `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`. The `AlterField.reduce` method is particularly relevant as it currently only handles the reduction to a RemoveField or RenameField operation but not to another AlterField operation. The suggested improvement is to add a check to consider the AlterField operation itself, which aligns with the issue report. Additionally, the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize` and `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` methods are relevant for understanding the overall optimization process. These findings indicate that the search results contain the necessary code spans to address the reported issue.",
