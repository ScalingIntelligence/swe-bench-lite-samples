The reported issue points out that the 'AlterField.reduce' method does not consider reducing multiple 'AlterField' operations into a single 'AlterField' operation, especially when dealing with 'AlterField' operations on the same field. This is directly reflected in the 'reduce' method of 'AlterField' where no condition is present to handle instances where 'operation' is another 'AlterField'. The proposed solution suggests adding a condition to handle this specific case. Additionally, other relevant code spans include the 'reduce' method of 'FieldOperation', the parent class of 'AlterField', which provides a default reduction logic, and the 'reduce' method of 'AddField', which handles reduction of 'AddField' with 'AlterField' operations, helping to understand the comparison logic. These findings suggest that the reported issue is indeed valid and the proposed solution has merit for implementation.",

The issue suggests that when an AddField operation is separated from the AlterField operations, the optimizer fails to reduce the AlterField operations as expected. This indicates a potential flaw in the reduce method of the AlterField class, which does not currently consider reducing AlterField operations that precede or follow each other.\n\nReviewing the existing file context, the AlterField class is defined, and it includes a reduce method. This method selectively reduces operations based on their type, such as RemoveField and RenameField, but it does not handle the case where the operation is another AlterField. This omission is directly relevant to the reported issue, as it points to a missing logical check for consecutive AlterField operations.\n\nTurning to the search results, the MigrationOptimizer class and its optimize_inner method are found. This method iterates through operations to attempt their reduction. It checks the results of the reduction and handles list or boolean results, but it does not make specific reference to the type AlterField, which would be crucial for addressing the current issue. This method could potentially be adjusted to better handle the specific case of multiple AlterField operations.\n\nTo address the reported issue effectively, enhancements should be made to the reduce method within the AlterField class to consider and reduce consecutive AlterField operations. Additionally, the optimize_inner method of the MigrationOptimizer could be updated to ensure that it proactively handles and potentially reduces such sequences.\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant code spans to address the issue include the reduce method in the AlterField class and the optimize_inner method in the MigrationOptimizer class. These sections of the code are where the primary logic for operation reduction resides and will need adjustments to include handling for consecutive AlterField operations.",
