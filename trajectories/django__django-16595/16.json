The user is particularly interested in understanding why consecutive AlterField operations are not reduced when separated by other operations. The search results provide insights into the implementation of the AlterField class and the MigrationOptimizer class, which are critical for resolving this issue.\n\n1. The AlterField class is defined in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and includes methods for initializing, deconstructing, and reducing the operation. Notably, the reduce method currently only reduces AlterField operations if they are followed by RemoveField or RenameField operations. This aligns with the user's observation that AlterField operations are not reduced when they are consecutive.\n\n2. The MigrationOptimizer class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' contains the optimize method, which iterates through operations to reduce them. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where consecutive AlterField operations might be reduced.\n\nGiven the user's suggestion to add a check in the reduce method of AlterField to consider reducing consecutive AlterField operations, the relevant code spans from the search results are identified to be the AlterField class definition and its reduce method. This will help in understanding the current behavior and potentially implementing the suggested change.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
