The provided search results offer valuable context within the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, where the `AlterField` class and its methods are defined. Notably, the `AlterField.reduce` method currently only checks for `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations to determine if reduction is possible, but it does not account for reducing consecutive `AlterField` operations that modify the same field. This aligns with the user's observation that the optimization does not handle such cases. The suggested solution involves modifying the `reduce` method to also check for instances where the operation is an `AlterField` and the field operations are the same, which would help in reducing consecutive `AlterField` operations. The `MigrationOptimizer.optimize` method in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` is also relevant as it is the primary method for optimizing migration operations, supporting the need to address this issue in the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are primarily those within the `AlterField.reduce` and potentially the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize` methods.",
