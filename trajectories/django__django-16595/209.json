The code currently handles reductions based on RemoveField and RenameField operations but does not include handling for consecutive AlterField operations.\n\nRelevant code spans identified include:\n- 'AddField.reduce' where the optimizer handles reducing AddField with AlterField.\n- 'AlterField.reduce' where the current reduction logic resides but lacks handling for consecutive AlterField operations.\n- 'FieldOperation.reduce' and 'MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner' which provide the general reduction framework but do not address the specific issue.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the identified relevant code spans do not currently address the issue.

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
