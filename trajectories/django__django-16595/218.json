The search results contain several relevant code spans in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, particularly the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method. The current implementation of `AlterField.reduce` does not handle the scenario where the `operation` is also an `AlterField`, which aligns with the issue description. Additionally, the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` includes the `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods, which are responsible for the optimization process but do not specifically address the reduction of consecutive AlterField operations in the described scenario. The proposed solution suggests adding a condition in the `AlterField.reduce` method to handle instances where the `operation` is an `AlterField`. These findings confirm the relevance of the search results to the reported issue.",

Specifically, the `AlterField` class contains the `reduce` method, which is central to the issue as it determines how operations are reduced. The `optimize` method in the `MigrationOptimizer` class also plays a key role in the process of optimization. The issue suggests that the `reduce` method in `AlterField` does not account for instances where the operation is also an `AlterField`. This behavior seems to be reflected in the existing code, where the `reduce` method checks for `RemoveField` and `RenameField` but does not check for another `AlterField`. Given this analysis, it appears that the relevant code has been identified, and the issue can be addressed by modifying the `reduce` method to include a check for `AlterField`.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended?
