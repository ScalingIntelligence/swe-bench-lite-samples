This could be due to the logic in the `reduce` method of the AlterField class, which currently does not consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField. To address this, we need to find the code related to the `reduce` method in the AlterField class and potentially the migration optimizer. Additionally, it would be useful to check the migration optimizer's `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods to understand how it processes operations.",

This behavior seems to stem from the current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method, which does not currently handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField. The suggested solution involves adding a condition to the reduce method to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and then applying a similar reduction process as is done with RemoveField. The search results accurately contain the relevant code spans for AlterField and MigrationOptimizer from Django's migrations modules, which directly address the issue. Specifically, the AlterField class and its reduce method are critical as they currently lack the handling of consecutive AlterField operations. Additionally, the MigrationOptimizer class and its optimize method are relevant as the optimization process itself is what's being questioned due to its failure to reduce multiple AlterField operations in certain scenarios. These code spans provide a clear context for potential modifications to address the issue reported.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
