Specifically, the optimizer fails to reduce 'AlterField' operations when they follow an 'AddField' operation, which could be due to a non-elidable migration or a non-squashed migration. The relevant classes and methods seem to be in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', particularly the 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method. Other relevant files include 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' for the actual optimization logic and potentially 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' for the automatic detection of changes that lead to migrations. Therefore, the search should focus on these files and classes/methods related to field operations and migration optimization.",

The key elements to look for in the code are AddField, AlterField, and the reduce method within these classes to understand how they handle reductions. The provided search results include significant parts of these classes such as AddField, AlterField, RemoveField, RenameField, and their respective reduce methods. The code for AlterField.reduce does not currently consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField, which aligns with the issue description. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those where the AlterField class and its reduce method are defined. To address the issue, the reduce method for AlterField could be modified to include an additional check for AlterField operations, which is suggested in the reported issue. This would involve adding a condition to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and then handling it accordingly. The relevant code spans from the search results include primarily the definitions and reduce methods of the AlterField and AddField classes, since these are directly related to the operations mentioned in the issue.",

Given the file context, it is clear that the relevant code for handling field operations and their reduction is present, but it does not fully address the reported issue.

The main issue pertains to the 'AlterField.reduce' method not handling cases where the operation is another 'AlterField'. This behavior is present in 'fields.py' where the 'AlterField' class has a 'reduce' method but does not check for instances of 'AlterField'. The 'AddField.reduce' method, also in 'fields.py', handles 'AlterField' instances differently by creating a new 'AddField' with the altered field. The 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'optimizer.py' processes operation optimization, and 'MigrationAutodetector' in 'autodetector.py' generates altered fields, but neither directly address the missing 'AlterField' handling discussed in the issue. Based on this analysis, critical relevant code for addressing the issue is found and the file context appears sufficiently complete to understand the issue and potential solution without needing additional specific files.",
