In 'operations/fields.py', the relevant sections are 'AlterField.reduce' and 'AddField.reduce', which are key to understanding how the reduction logic works for AlterField and AddField operations. The 'AlterField.reduce' method currently does not explicitly check if the operation is also an AlterField, which aligns with the issue reported. The 'AddField.reduce' method, however, does include a check for AlterField operations, suggesting a discrepancy that could be addressed. The 'optimizer.py' file contains the 'MigrationOptimizer.optimize' and 'MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner' methods, which are responsible for the actual optimization process. This indicates that the search results provide enough context to understand and potentially fix the issue or document the behavior.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
