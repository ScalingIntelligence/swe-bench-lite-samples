The core of the issue seems to be in the 'reduce' method of the 'AlterField' class, which does not consider the case where the operation is also an 'AlterField'. I've inspected the provided code spans in 'fields.py' and 'optimizer.py'. In 'fields.py', I see the 'AlterField' class with a 'reduce' method that currently only handles 'RemoveField' and 'RenameField' operations in its reduce logic, but it doesn't check for 'AlterField'. This omission could be why the optimizer isn't reducing multiple 'AlterField' operations as expected. Additionally, the 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'optimizer.py' is responsible for the optimization process, and it seems to correctly implement an iterative logic to optimize the migration operations. This analysis leads me to suggest that the relevant code spans are those that define the 'AlterField' reduce method and its interactions with other field operations, as well as the overall optimization logic in 'MigrationOptimizer'. Therefore, the identified relevant code spans are in 'fields.py' under 'AlterField' and in 'optimizer.py' under 'MigrationOptimizer'.",

This is evident from the provided code where the 'reduce' method only checks for 'RemoveField' and 'RenameField' operations, but not 'AlterField'. To address this issue, the 'reduce' method should be extended to consider the case where 'operation' is also an 'AlterField' and merge the operations if they target the same field. Additionally, the 'optimize' method in the 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'optimizer.py' should be reviewed to ensure it handles the reduced operations correctly. This involves ensuring that the loop continues to optimize until no further reductions can be made, indicating that all possible optimizations have been applied.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
