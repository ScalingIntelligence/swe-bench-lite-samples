The focus is on the `reduce` method within the `AlterField` class, specifically how it handles reducing AlterField operations when they follow an AddField operation. The provided code spans from `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` offer insights into the current behavior and logic of these methods. The `reduce` method in both `AddField` and `AlterField` classes is of particular interest as it outlines the logic for reducing operations. The issue suggests that the current implementation does not handle reductions as expected when multiple AlterField operations follow an AddField operation, leading to inefficiencies in migration optimization. To address this, the suggestion is to modify the `reduce` method within the `AlterField` class to consider when the operation is also an `AlterField` instance, potentially by adding a condition to check if the operation is an `AlterField` and then determine if it's a 'same field operation'. The code spans provided include the constructor methods (`__init__`), reduce methods, and other relevant functionalities. These snippets are essential as they determine how field operations are managed, reduced, and optimized across migrations. Examining these methods in detail can help identify areas for improvement to better optimize migration operations and reduce redundancy.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
