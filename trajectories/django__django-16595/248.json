The issue specifically points out that when AlterField operations are separated from an AddField operation, they are not reduced. The proposed solution involves enhancing the AlterField.reduce method to consider instances where the operation is also an AlterField. The provided search results contain relevant code from the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, particularly the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method. The `reduce` method currently handles cases for `RemoveField` and `RenameField` but lacks handling for multiple `AlterField` operations. Additionally, the `MigrationOptimizer` class and its `optimize` method from `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` are relevant as they pertain to the optimization process itself. These findings suggest that the changes should be made in the `AlterField.reduce` method to accommodate the proposed enhancement.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
