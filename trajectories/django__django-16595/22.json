The current behavior does not reduce multiple AlterField operations effectively when they are separated from an AddField operation.

To address this, we need to check if the `reduce` method considers the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`. The suggested solution involves adding a conditional check within the `reduce` method to handle this scenario properly.",
