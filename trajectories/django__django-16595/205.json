The issue also suggests a potential enhancement to the AlterField.reduce method to handle this case. From the search results, the relevant code spans include the definitions and implementations of the FieldOperation, AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField classes, as well as the MigrationOptimizer.optimize method. The key code spans to focus on are those related to the reduce method in the AlterField class, as this is where the identified issue lies. The code spans also include the initialization and reduce methods for each operation class to understand how they interact or should interact for optimization. Given the information, the identified code spans are those defining and implementing the reduce logic for the AlterField and MigrationOptimizer classes, as well as the related operation classes.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
