This aligns with the suggested behavior where the `reduce` method should handle instances where the operation is also an AlterField. The search results include the necessary code to identify and possibly modify to address the issue. The optimizer itself is in a separate file but only handles the optimization loop.

The issue notes that `AlterField.reduce` does not currently consider the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`, suggesting a modification to handle this scenario. The provided example suggests adding a check within `AlterField.reduce` to detect if the operation is an `AlterField` and if it is the same field operation, which would allow the optimizer to reduce multiple `AlterField` operations. The search results include the existing `reduce` methods for `AddField` and `AlterField`, which currently do not handle the case of reducing multiple `AlterField` operations into a single `AlterField`. The search results seem comprehensive and relevant to addressing the reported issue, as they provide the necessary context for modifying the `AlterField.reduce` method to handle the proposed optimization.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
