Specifically, when multiple `AlterField` operations are performed in sequence without an `AddField` operation preceding them, the optimizer does not reduce these operations as expected. This suggests a potential oversight in the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class. It may be beneficial to investigate this method further to determine if it correctly handles instances where the operation being reduced is also an `AlterField`. Additionally, reviewing the `is_same_field_operation` method might be useful to ensure that it appropriately distinguishes between different `AlterField` operations on the same field. Lastly, considering the broader context of the migration optimizer's handling of sequence optimizations could provide insight into whether this is an intended behavior or an area for improvement.",

Specifically, it highlights that the optimizer fails to reduce multiple `AlterField` operations into a single operation when the `AddField` operation is separated. The provided code examples and context show how the `AlterField` class is defined and how its `reduce` method is currently implemented. The `reduce` method does not currently check for instances of `AlterField` as potential operations to reduce. This is the core issue that needs to be addressed. The search results provide detailed contexts of the `AlterField` class and related methods, which are crucial for understanding how to modify the `reduce` method to resolve the reported issue. The code spans identified include the `__init__` method, the `reduce` method, and other related methods such as `database_forwards`, `database_backwards`, `describe`, and `migration_name_fragment`. These spans are relevant because they help in understanding the logic behind how `AlterField` operations are currently handled and how they might need to be updated to include the ability to reduce multiple `AlterField` operations.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
