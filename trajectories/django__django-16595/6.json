Specifically, the issue notes that the optimizer does not reduce consecutive AlterField operations if they are not immediately following an AddField operation. This behavior is not documented and may not be intentional. The provided search results include the relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. The AlterField class in 'fields.py' contains the logic for initializing, deconstructing, and applying database alterations for a field. Notably, the 'reduce' method currently only considers RemoveField and RenameField operations, as well as general reductions from the parent class. The MigrationOptimizer class in 'optimizer.py' defines the optimize method, which iteratively calls optimize_inner to attempt to reduce the list of operations. The optimize_inner method iterates through the operations and attempts to reduce them using the reduce method of each operation. Based on the reported issue, the missing functionality is the ability to reduce consecutive AlterField operations. Implementing a check for AlterField instances within the reduce method of AlterField could address the issue.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
