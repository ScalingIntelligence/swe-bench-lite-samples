The issue points out that the current implementation of AlterField.reduce does not handle the scenario where one AlterField operation is followed by another. This leads to a discussion on whether this behavior is intended and suggests a potential modification to improve the reduction logic. Upon examining the provided search results, it becomes evident that the code in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' is pertinent. Specifically, the 'AlterField.reduce' method should be enhanced to also consider the possibility that the incoming operation is another 'AlterField'. The current logic only deals with 'RemoveField' and 'RenameField', missing the opportunity to collapse consecutive 'AlterField' operations that modify the same field. Thus, the relevant code span to target for potential modifications is the 'AlterField.reduce' method. Given the nature of the issue, this span seems to cover the essence of the problem, suggesting that more work might be needed to fully address the issue in the broader context of the Django migration framework.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
