This raises several points to investigate within the Django migration module: 1) The AlterField class and its reduce method in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', specifically how it handles situations where the operation is also an AlterField. 2) The MigrationOptimizer class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py', focusing on the optimize method's handling of operations including AddField and AlterField. 3) Possibly the base Operation class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/base.py', especially the reduce method which may play a role in how operations interact with each other during optimization. Based on the issue context, these specific areas need further inspection to understand the current behavior and potential for adjustments or documentation.",

The user is concerned that the current implementation does not reduce consecutive AlterField operations effectively when separated from an AddField operation. This leads to unnecessary AlterField operations remaining in the migration.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant files identified are 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. The critical code span in 'fields.py' is found in the AlterField class's 'reduce' method, which currently lacks handling for the scenario where the operation is another AlterField. Adding a check for AlterField within this method would align with the user's suggestion.\n\nIn 'optimizer.py', the MigrationOptimizer class's 'optimize' and 'optimize_inner' methods handle the general optimization process. However, they rely on the individual operations' 'reduce' methods to determine if they can be eliminated or not. Since the current AlterField.reduce method does not consider another AlterField, it fails to optimize these specific cases.\n\nThus, the solution involves modifying the AlterField.reduce method to include a check for another AlterField, extending the existing logic to handle this case appropriately.",
