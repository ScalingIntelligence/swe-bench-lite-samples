The issue describes a scenario where the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField operations when they are separated from an AddField operation. This behavior is evident from the provided example and the suggestion to modify the reduce method in the AlterField class to handle instances where the operation is also an AlterField.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, the relevant sections involved in this issue are from the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py and django/db/migrations/optimizer.py files. Specifically, the AlterField class and its reduce method, along with the MigrationOptimizer class and its optimize and optimize_inner methods are critical to understanding and potentially addressing the reported issue.\n\nThe AlterField class currently has a reduce method that handles removal and renaming of fields but does not consider reducing instances of AlterField operations among themselves. This aligns with the issue's description that the reduce method does not cater to the scenario where multiple AlterField operations need to be reduced. Additionally, the MigrationOptimizer's optimize_inner method iterates through operations to perform reductions, which is where the logic for handling multiple AlterField operations should potentially be extended.\n\nBased on the issue's specifics and the provided code sections, the identified spans are the reduce method in the AlterField class and the optimize_inner method in the MigrationOptimizer class, as these are directly involved in the optimization process and conjunction with the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
