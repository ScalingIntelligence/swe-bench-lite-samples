The relevant files and code spans identified from the provided context are primarily within the `django/db/migrations` directory, focusing on operations related to field alterations and model operations. The key files of interest are: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`, and `django/db/migrations/operations/base.py`. These files contain the definitions for operations like AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and the MigrationOptimizer, which is responsible for optimizing migration operations. The main concern seems to be the `reduce` method within the AlterField class, which might not be handling multiple AlterField operations as expected. Additionally, the `optimize` method in the MigrationOptimizer class also plays a crucial role in this context. Therefore, the search parameters should focus on these methods and any related logic that could affect the reduction of multiple AlterField operations.",

The relevant code spans to address this issue are likely in the 'FieldOperation', 'AlterField', and 'MigrationOptimizer' classes. Specifically, the 'AlterField.reduce' method and the 'MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner' method are critical for understanding how the optimizer handles these operations. Additionally, the 'is_same_field_operation' method in 'FieldOperation' is relevant for determining if two operations are affecting the same field. The current implementation of 'AlterField.reduce' does not consider reducing multiple AlterField instances if they are separated from an AddField, which aligns with the reported issue. To address this, the suggested approach is to add a check for AlterField within AlterField's reduce method.",
