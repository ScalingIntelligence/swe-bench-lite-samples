The current behavior does not seem to reduce the AlterField operations as expected. This could be due to a missing check in the reduce method of the AlterField class to consider if the operation is another AlterField. The relevant classes are in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. Additionally, the 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method need a closer look.",

This implies that the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class might not be handling other AlterField operations correctly. The provided code spans include the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method, which is crucial for identifying how the optimizer behaves with AlterField operations. Additionally, the `AddField` class and its `reduce` method are also relevant as they interact with AlterField operations during optimization. The code spans cover the necessary methods and logic involved in the reduction process. Therefore, the identified code spans should provide a comprehensive context for understanding and addressing the issue.
