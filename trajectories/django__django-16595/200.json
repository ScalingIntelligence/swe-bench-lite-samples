The issue suggests adding a check in the reduce method of the AlterField class to handle this case. The provided search results contain the relevant code spans that need to be examined and potentially modified to address this issue. The code spans include the AlterField class, its __init__ and reduce methods in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', and the optimize and optimize_inner methods in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. These methods are critical for understanding how the optimizer works and how AlterField operations are currently handled. The MigrationAutodetector class and its _optimize_migrations method in 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' also provide context on how migrations are optimized, but do not directly address the specific issue. Keywords extracted from the issue include 'AddField', 'AlterField', 'optimize', 'reduce', and 'is_same_field_operation'. These keywords guide the search and match with the available code spans. The investigation reveals that the current implementation of the reduce method in the AlterField class does not consider the scenario where operation is also an AlterField, necessitating a modification as suggested in the issue.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
