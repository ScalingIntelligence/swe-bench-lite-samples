The reported issue specifically mentions the lack of reduction of multiple `AlterField` operations when they follow an `AddField` operation, potentially due to non-elidable migrations or inside non-squashed migrations. The current implementation of `AlterField.reduce` does not consider reducing `AlterField` operations if they are subsequent to another `AlterField`. The provided search results contain the `AlterField` class with its methods, including `__init__`, `deconstruct`, `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, `database_backwards`, `describe`, `migration_name_fragment`, and `reduce`. The relevant part of the code is the `reduce` method within the `AlterField` class, which currently only handles `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations. To address the issue, the `reduce` method needs to be modified to also handle subsequent `AlterField` operations, which aligns with the suggested code addition in the reported issue.",

Specifically, it notes that when multiple AlterField operations are present without an AddField operation, they are not reduced as expected. This issue could be addressed by modifying the AlterField.reduce method to recognize and handle consecutive AlterField operations. The provided file context and search results include relevant code spans that define the AlterField class and its reduce method. These spans appear to be directly related to the reported issue. The AlterField.reduce method currently handles specific types of operations like RemoveField and RenameField, but it does not account for other AlterField operations. This omission seems to be the root cause of the problem. By examining the provided code spans, it is clear that the AlterField.reduce method needs to be enhanced to handle cases where the operation is also an AlterField. This enhancement would likely resolve the issue and align the behavior with the user's expectations. The identified code spans in the search results are sufficient to understand and address the issue. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete.",

The current behavior of the optimizer is not reducing multiple AlterField operations when they are separated from the AddField operation. The issue suggests adding a condition in the AlterField.reduce method to handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField.\n\nFrom examining the current file context, we see the relevant code in the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file. The FieldOperation, AddField, RemoveField, and AlterField classes are important for understanding how field operations are handled and reduced. The AlterField.reduce method currently handles reduction for RemoveField and RenameField but not for AlterField.\n\nThe new search results in django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py provide additional context on how operations are defined and reduced. However, the key modification suggested by the issue is within the AlterField.reduce method. This method should include a condition to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and if it is the same field operation. If so, it should return [operation], which would indicate that the operation can be reduced.\n\nThe other operations and their reduction methods are not directly related to this specific issue and mostly address different types of operations such as adding, removing, or renaming fields, models, and other model-related options and fields. Therefore, the focus should be on the relevant AlterField class and its reduce method to implement the suggested change.\n\nTo summarize, the identified code spans based on the reported issue should focus on the FieldOperation, AlterField, and AlterField.reduce method. The relevant file is django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py, specifically the AlterField class and its reduce method.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
