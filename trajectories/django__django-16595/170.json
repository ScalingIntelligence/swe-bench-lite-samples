The current logic does not reduce multiple `AlterField` operations if they are not immediately preceded by an `AddField` operation. The issue suggests adding a condition in the `reduce` method of `AlterField` to handle this case, potentially by checking if the `operation` is also an `AlterField` and then returning the `operation` if it is a 'same field operation'. This requires focusing on the `AlterField` and `FieldOperation` classes in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file and the `reduce` method in particular.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the Django migration optimizer's handling of multiple AlterField operations. The issue specifically highlights that when multiple AlterField operations follow an AddField operation, they are not reduced or optimized as expected. The user suggests an improvement to the AlterField.reduce method to handle cases where the operation is also an AlterField. To address this, we need to look at the relevant parts of the Django migrations code base, focusing on the FieldOperation class and its subclasses like AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField, especially their reduce methods. The search results include code spans from files like `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`, and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, which are crucial for understanding how these operations are currently handled and potentially improved. From the code spans provided, the methods named `reduce` in the classes `FieldOperation`, `AddField`, `RemoveField`, `AlterField`, and `RenameField` are particularly relevant. The `AlterField.reduce` method's current implementation only considers `RemoveField`, `RenameField`, and the superclass's reduce method, but does not explicitly handle or attempt to reduce consecutive AlterField operations, which aligns with the user's issue description. Therefore, the proposed improvement to check if an operation is an instance of AlterField and if they modify the same field, could be a viable enhancement.",
