Specifically, when an AddField operation is separated from subsequent AlterField operations, the optimizer does not reduce the AlterField operations as it should. This could be due to a missing case in the AlterField.reduce method where it should consider reducing if the operation is also an AlterField. The provided code snippets indicate relevant files and methods that should be inspected to find the exact implementation causing the issue. Given the context, the focus should be on the AlterField class in the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file and the optimize method in the django/db/migrations/optimizer.py file.",

Specifically, it notes that the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField operations if they follow an AddField operation, especially when they are separated in the migration history. The provided code spans from the search results include crucial parts of the Django migration framework relevant to this issue. These include the implementation of the `FieldOperation` and `AlterField` classes, particularly the `__init__` and `reduce` methods of `AlterField`. The `reduce` method currently handles the reduction of `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations but does not consider other `AlterField` operations. This aligns with the issue's suggestion for improvement. Additionally, the `MigrationOptimizer` class and its `optimize` method are relevant as they oversee the optimization process and could benefit from any changes made to the `reduce` method in `AlterField`. Given this analysis, the identified code spans are pertinent to implementing the suggested improvement and resolving the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
