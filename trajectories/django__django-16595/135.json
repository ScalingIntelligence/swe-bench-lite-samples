The current implementation of AlterField.reduce does not handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField, leading to inefficiencies. To address this, we need to specifically locate and examine the implementation of the reduce method in the AlterField class within Django's migration operations. Additionally, the optimizer's behavior should be scrutinized to ensure it correctly optimizes sequences of AlterField operations.

Specifically, the `reduce` method in `AlterField` does not currently handle the case where the operation being reduced is also an `AlterField`, which is the core problem described in the issue. This is evidenced by the absence of a condition in the `AlterField.reduce` method that checks for `isinstance(operation, AlterField)` and subsequently processes it accordingly. The suggested addition in the issue: `if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation): return [operation]` would address this by ensuring that when an `AlterField` is encountered, it is properly handled rather than being overlooked. The `AddField.reduce` method does include handling for `AlterField` operations, which indicates a potential discrepancy in how different field operations are being processed within the migration operations. Additionally, the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` method, which is responsible for applying the optimizations, confirms the iterative process of reducing operations by calling the `reduce` method on each operation. This method relies on the `reduce` methods of individual operations to determine if a reduction can be made, further emphasizing the need for the proposed change in the `AlterField.reduce` method. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those within the `AlterField.reduce` and possibly `AddField.reduce` methods, as well as any other areas that handle the reduction of field operations within the migration process. Specifically, the span for `AlterField.reduce` should be modified to include the suggested check for `AlterField` operations.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
