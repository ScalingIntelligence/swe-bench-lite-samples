The user observed that when there are multiple AlterField operations following an AddField operation, the optimizer reduces them to just the AddField. However, if the AddField is separated from the AlterField operations, none of the AlterField operations are reduced. The user is suggesting that the AlterField.reduce method should consider reducing AlterField operations when the previous operation is also an AlterField.\n\nThe search results include the relevant files and code spans related to the migration operations. There are classes for AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField, which all inherit from FieldOperation. The key methods to look at are the reduce methods for each of these operations. The AddField.reduce method already checks if the operation is an AlterField and handles it accordingly by returning a new AddField instance. The AlterField.reduce method, however, does not consider the case where the operation is another AlterField, which is the behavior the user is questioning.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the relevant code spans to focus on are those within the AlterField class and specifically its reduce method. This method should potentially be updated to also consider reducing subsequent AlterField operations to avoid redundancy.\n\nThe search results also include the MigrationOptimizer class, which is responsible for optimizing the migration operations. Its optimize method iterates until no more optimizations can be made, which seems relevant but does not directly address the issue with AlterField operations.",

The code spans provided in the file context reveal the implementation of FieldOperation and its subclasses, including AddField, AlterField, RemoveField, and RenameField. Each class includes a reduce method that determines how the operation can be merged with or replaced by subsequent operations to optimize the migration process. The AlterField.reduce method, in particular, currently does not handle the scenario where the operation it is trying to reduce is another AlterField, which aligns with the issue's description. The suggested modification in the issue to include a check for isinstance(operation, AlterField) within the reduce method may help in reducing such redundant AlterField operations. The search result presents the MigrationOptimizer class and its optimize method, which iterates over the operation list to optimize them. This method is central to the optimization process, but the issue is more about the logic within the AlterField.reduce method and how it deals with other AlterField operations. Thus, the focus should be on enhancing the AlterField.reduce method to address the identified issue as suggested in the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
