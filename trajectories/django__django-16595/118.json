The provided files show that AlterField is a subclass of FieldOperation and it has a reduce method that currently doesn't consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField.

The issue suggests adding a check within the `reduce` method to handle the case where the operation is also an AlterField, ensuring that situations where multiple identical AlterField operations are attempted without an initial AddField are optimized correctly.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the Migration optimizer not reducing multiple AlterField operations effectively in certain scenarios. The key elements in the issue include: 1) A list of migration operations involving AddField and multiple AlterField operations. 2) The expectation that the optimizer should reduce these AlterField operations but it doesn't. 3) The suggestion to add a condition in the AlterField.reduce method to account for AlterField operations reducing into other AlterField operations. \n\nReviewing the current file context in django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py, we see the FieldOperation and AlterField classes with their __init__, is_same_field_operation, and reduce methods. The reduce method in AlterField currently does not handle the case where an operation is another AlterField, which aligns with the issue. \n\nIn the new search results, the django/db/migrations/optimizer.py file contains the MigrationOptimizer class with its optimize and optimize_inner methods. These methods handle the optimization logic, but they rely on the reduce method of individual operations, which currently doesn't handle the AlterField reducing into another AlterField as suggested in the issue. \n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are in both the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py (for the FieldOperation and AlterField classes) and in django/db/migrations/optimizer.py (for the MigrationOptimizer class). These spans are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the code to address the issue with the optimizer's handling of AlterField operations.",
