Specifically, it points out that the AlterField.reduce method does not account for consecutive AlterField operations on the same field. This contrasts with the expectation that multiple AlterField operations on the same field should be optimized into a single operation if their attributes align. The issue suggests adding a condition to the AlterField.reduce method to handle such cases. The provided search results contain relevant code spans in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` files, which are directly related to the mentioned operations and optimization logic.

This aligns with the need to modify this method to handle consecutive `AlterField` operations more effectively.",
