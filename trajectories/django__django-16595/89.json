The key files to investigate are 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py', and possibly 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py'. The focus should be on the 'AlterField' class within 'fields.py' and the 'optimize' method in 'optimizer.py'. It's likely that the 'reduce' method in 'AlterField' needs to be adjusted to handle this specific case of multiple AlterField operations after an AddField. Additionally, checking the 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'optimizer.py' is crucial to understand the optimization logic.",
