This can happen when AddField and AlterField operations are separated, which might occur due to non-elidable migrations or being part of non-squashed migrations. The optimization process should ideally merge these operations, but it seems to miss the case where an operation is also an AlterField. To address this, we should investigate the reduce method in the AlterField class and the optimize method in the MigrationOptimizer class to understand why multiple AlterField operations are not being reduced as expected. Additionally, we should check if there's a requirement to update the optimization logic or documentation to handle such cases more effectively.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on the optimization of multiple AlterField operations in migration workflows. Specifically, it highlights a discrepancy where the optimization does not work as expected when AlterField operations follow an AddField operation, especially when they are separated by other migrations or are part of unsquashed migrations. This suggests a need to enhance the reduction logic within the AlterField class's reduce method. The provided search results reveal relevant code spans within the Django migrations framework, particularly in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`, `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` files. These files contain definitions and implementations related to field operations, model operations, migration optimizer, and automatic migration detection, all of which are closely tied to addressing the issue at hand. For instance, the `AlterField` class in `fields.py` has a method `reduce` that is particularly relevant as it currently does not account for reducing AlterField operations into a single AlterField when followed by another AlterField. This is a clear target for improvement based on the issue description. Additionally, the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `optimizer.py` governs the overall optimization process, which is also crucial to resolving the reported problem. Looking at these code spans within their respective files narrows down the focus to specific methods and logic blocks that need to be adjusted or extended to handle the scenario described in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
