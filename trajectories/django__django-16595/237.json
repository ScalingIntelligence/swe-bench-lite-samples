The issue specifically mentions that the AlterField.reduce method does not currently consider reducing multiple AlterField operations into a single operation if they are altering the same field, which could lead to redundant database operations during migration. This is particularly relevant in situations where multiple consecutive AlterField operations are performed on the same field, but not immediately following an AddField operation. The provided search results from django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py include classes and methods directly related to field operations and their reduction strategies. Notably, the AlterField class and its reduce method are present, which is core to the issue. The suggested addition to the AlterField.reduce method to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and if it's targeting the same field operation could potentially resolve the issue by allowing such operations to be reduced more effectively. Thus, the relevant code spans include the defined methods within the AlterField and FieldOperation classes that handle the reduction of field operations. These spans encapsulate the logic for field operations and reduction, making them directly pertinent to the reported issue.",

The suggested solution involves modifying the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class to handle the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`. The current context and search results provide insights into the existing structure and methods related to field operations in Django migrations.\n\nThe `FieldOperation` class and its subclasses, including `AlterField`, are central to understanding how field manipulations are managed during migrations. The `reduce` method in `AlterField` does not currently consider another `AlterField` operation, which seems to be the core issue. The search results confirm the presence of this method and other related methods such as `is_same_field_operation` and `references_field`.\n\nGiven the issue and the suggested solution, the most relevant code spans are those that define the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class and possibly the `FieldOperation` class if the solution requires a more systemic change.

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
