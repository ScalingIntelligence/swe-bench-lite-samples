The relevant files provided suggest that the logic for handling field operations and optimizations is primarily located in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. The specific function of interest in these files would be 'reduce' within the 'AlterField' class and the 'optimize' method in 'MigrationOptimizer'. To address the issue, one would likely need to modify the logic within these functions to account for consecutive AlterField operations. Additionally, documentation improvements might be needed to clarify the behavior of the migration optimizer regarding such cases.",

This results in multiple AlterField operations not being optimized when an AddField operation is not present in the sequence. The user suggests a potential improvement to the `reduce` method by adding a condition to check if the operation is an AlterField and if it involves the same field. This would ensure that such operations can be reduced effectively.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are associated with the `AlterField` class definition and its methods. Particularly, the `reduce` method is of interest as it is where the enhancement suggested by the user would likely be implemented.
