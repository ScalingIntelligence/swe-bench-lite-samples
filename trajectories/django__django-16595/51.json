The provided context suggests that the AlterField class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' might be a key point of focus due to its methods like is_same_field_operation, reduce, and others. Additionally, the MigrationOptimizer class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' could also be relevant as it includes the optimize and optimize_inner methods which are directly related to optimizing migration operations. To resolve this issue, it might be necessary to inspect the behavior and logic within the reduce method of the AlterField class to ensure it correctly reduces multiple AlterField operations.",

Specifically, the issue arises when an AddField operation is separated from the subsequent AlterField operations, causing the optimizer to fail in reducing the AlterField operations. The issue suggests that the AlterField.reduce method does not consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField. This behavior is highlighted by the user's example of operations and the call to optimizer.optimize(). The search results provide the relevant code in the django/db/migrations/optimizer.py file, which includes the MigrationOptimizer class and its methods: optimize() and optimize_inner(). These methods are central to how the optimizer processes migration operations and attempt to reduce them. The code provided directly addresses the issue by showing the logic involved in optimizing migrations, including how operations are iterated over and reduced. This provides a clear reference for understanding and potentially modifying the current behavior to handle the described issue.",

The user observes that the AlterField operations are not merged as expected when the AddField operation is isolated. The provided file context shows the current implementation of the MigrationOptimizer and its optimize and optimize_inner methods, which handle the optimization process. The new search results include the FieldOperation class and its subclasses (AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField), which are used for migration operations. These are crucial for understanding how field operations interact and should potentially reduce. The AlterField class is of particular interest, as it directly addresses the issue. It defines the reduce method, which currently does not account for the scenario where the operation is another AlterField. The user suggests adding a check for isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation) to the reduce method of AlterField to allow for reducing multiple AlterField operations. This suggestion aligns with the issue's requirement to optimize AlterField operations more effectively. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans are identified from the new search results.",

This oversight leads to redundant migrations, especially when AlterField operations are separated by non-field operations or are part of non-squashed migrations. To address this, the `reduce` method needs to be updated to include logic that checks for consecutive AlterField operations and potentially merges them into a single AlterField operation, thus optimizing migration steps. This involves ensuring that the field attributes considered in the reduction process align with the final desired field state, avoiding unnecessary intermediate steps.

The current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method does not handle the case where the operation is another AlterField, leading to inefficiencies in migration optimization. This is evident from the provided code spans where the AlterField.reduce method does not check for other AlterField instances. To address this, the suggested modification involves enhancing the AlterField.reduce method to consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField and to return [operation] if they are the same field operation. This change would streamline the migration process by reducing redundant AlterField operations.\n\nThe search results provided include the relevant sections of the codebase from 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py'. These sections cover the FieldOperation class, its subclasses (AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField), and their respective methods, particularly focusing on the reduce method for each. This provides the necessary context to understand the current behavior and identify the specific changes needed to improve the optimization of AlterField operations.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
