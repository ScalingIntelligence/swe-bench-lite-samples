Specifically, it points out that when multiple AlterField operations are present, they are not reduced as expected, especially when separated from an AddField operation. Given this, the relevant sections of the code to focus on are those that define and handle AlterField operations within the context of migration optimization. The current file context and search results provide the necessary code spans for AlterField and AddField classes, specifically the AlterField.reduce method. The current implementation of AlterField.reduce does not consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField, which is inline with the issue being reported. To address this, I would suggest including an additional check for isinstance(operation, AlterField) in the AlterField.reduce method to reduce multiple AlterField operations. This further emphasizes the block of code in the search results for AlterField.reduce as directly relevant to the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The issue reported involves the reduction of multiple AlterField operations in Django migrations when a preceding AddField operation is separated. The current Django migration optimizer does not handle subsequent AlterField operations that are separated from the AddField, even if they modify the same field. This behavior is not intended based on the Django migration optimization strategies and should be addressed in the AlterField.reduce method. The search results provided include relevant code spans that define the optimizer logic for the Django migration process. The MigrationOptimizer.optimize method is critically important for the reported issue, as it is the entry point for migration optimization, calling the optimize_inner method to iterate over each operation to find reductions. It is essential to ensure that the optimize_inner method properly handles the reduction of AlterField operations when they are separated from the preceding AddField operation. Therefore, it is imperative to review these code spans and potentially adjust the logic within the AlterField.reduce method to accommodate the case where operation is also an AlterField, possibly modeling the behavior using code such as `if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation): return [operation]` if deemed appropriate after further analysis of the existing code and migration strategies.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided search results, we can see the code spans that involve the migration optimizer logic, which significantly relate to the issue. The necessary adjustments within the AlterField.reduce method, as suggested in the issue, could significantly improve the optimizer's handling of separated AlterField operations, potentially reducing a significant amount of the reported migration optimizer's suboptimal behavior.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
