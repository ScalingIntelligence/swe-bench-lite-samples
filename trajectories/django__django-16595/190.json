Specifically, it notes that when the AddField operation is separated from the AlterField operations, the optimizer does not reduce the AlterField operations effectively. This suggests that the logic in the AlterField.reduce method might not be handling the case where the operation being reduced is also an AlterField. The provided search results include relevant code spans from the Django migration operations, particularly focusing on the FieldOperation, AddField, AlterField, and RemoveField classes. These spans include methods for initialization, deconstruction, state forwarding, database operations, and reduction logic, which are crucial for understanding how fields are added, altered, and removed during migrations. The AlterField.reduce method currently checks for RemoveField and RenameField operations but does not explicitly check for another AlterField operation. This aligns with the user's observation and suggestion that additional logic might be needed in the reduce method to handle this case. Analyzing the code, the relevant spans appear to be those that deal with the reduce method of the AlterField class, specifically where it checks for the type of operation it is reducing. This could be the key area for addressing the issue described. Additionally, reviewing the AddField.reduce method and how it interacts with AlterField operations might also be beneficial for ensuring comprehensive optimization.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
