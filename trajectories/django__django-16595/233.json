The provided context points to several relevant files and functions related to migrations and their optimization. The key focus is on the 'reduce' method of the 'AlterField' class within the 'fields.py' module. To address the issue, it's necessary to identify where and how AlterField operations are being processed and potentially optimized. The main goal is to determine if AlterField operations should consider reducing consecutive AlterField operations and whether this behavior should be documented. Thus, the search should concentrate on the 'reduce' method and any associated logic within the 'AlterField' class.",

Specifically, the user is concerned that when multiple AlterField operations modify the same field consecutively, the optimizer does not reduce them into a single operation, which it does for an initial AddField followed by AlterFields. The user provides a potential solution that involves enhancing the AlterField.reduce method to handle a situation where the operation being reduced is also an AlterField and the fields are the same. The provided code context and search results show the current implementation of the AlterField class and its reduce method. The relevant code span is where the reduce method checks if the operation is an instance of RemoveField and then proceeds accordingly. The user's suggestion is to add a condition to check if the operation is an AlterField and if the fields are the same, which is not currently implemented. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified in the AlterField class, particularly the reduce method, to understand how the current condition works and to identify where the new condition could be added.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
