The provided search results contain relevant code spans in two main files: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. In 'fields.py', the code spans relevant to the issue are those that define the FieldOperation, AddField, and AlterField classes, especially the methods such as __init__, is_same_field_operation, references_field, and reduce. The AlterField.reduce method specifically seems crucial as it currently only considers RemoveField or RenameField for reduction, ignoring other AlterField operations, which aligns with the issue. In 'optimizer.py', the MigrationOptimizer class and its methods, especially optimize and optimize_inner, are relevant as they manage the optimization process of migration operations. The provided code spans suggest necessary implementations for the proposed solution in the issue, which could involve adding an additional condition in AlterField.reduce to handle scenarios where the operation is also an AlterField. This would potentially lead to further reduction of AlterField operations, resolving the issue at hand.",
