The search results contain methods from the MigrationOptimizer class that are directly related to the optimization process. The 'optimize' and 'optimize_inner' methods are where the logic for reducing operations is implemented. Reviewing these methods, it is clear that they iterate through operations and attempt to reduce them based on their interaction with other operations.

Specifically, it suggests modifying the reduce method in the AlterField class to account for cases where the subsequent operation is also an AlterField. The provided search results contain relevant code from the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file, particularly the AlterField class with its reduce method. This method currently handles reduction against RemoveField and RenameField but does not consider the scenario where the operation is another AlterField. This omission is likely the reason behind the reported behavior, where multiple AlterField operations are not reduced as expected. The context provided includes the MigrationOptimizer class, which is central to the migration optimization logic, but it does not detail how AlterField operations might be reduced within the optimization process. The evidence supports the need to update the AlterField.reduce method to include instances where the operation is an AlterField to resolve the reported issue.",
