            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue identifies a problem with the MigrationOptimizer not reducing multiple AlterField operations when they are separate from an AddField operation. This suggests a need to enhance the logic in AlterField.reduce to consider situations where multiple AlterField operations modify the same field. Given the context and the code spans provided, the primary focus should be on the reduce method within the AlterField class and possibly the MigrationOptimizer class to ensure that overlapping or consecutive AlterField operations are properly merged or collapsed. The current implementation of AlterField.reduce only considers RemoveField and RenameField operations in its reduction logic, which does not address the issue at hand involving multiple AlterField operations. To resolve this, the logic should be expanded to include a check for when an operation is itself an instance of AlterField and handle this case appropriately, possibly by collapsing consecutive identical AlterField operations into a single operation to optimize the migration process. This could be achieved by introducing a new condition in the reduce method, such as the proposed:\n\n```python\nif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation):\n    return [operation]\n```\n\nThis change would need to be applied in the context of how operations are processed and reduced within the MigrationOptimizer, potentially modifying the optimize_inner method to account for such reductions.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans for addressing this issue are located in the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file, specifically the AlterField class's __init__ and reduce methods, and in the django/db/migrations/optimizer.py file, mainly within the MigrationOptimizer class's optimize and optimize_inner methods.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
