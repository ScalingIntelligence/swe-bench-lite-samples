Specifically, it seems that the AlterField.reduce method does not consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField, leading to failure in reducing multiple AlterField operations when they are separate from an AddField operation. To address this, I will first check if the current file context already includes the relevant file 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', since it contains the classes for FieldOperation, AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField, all of which are central to this issue. Since no files have been found yet, I will need to search for the relevant code segments.",
