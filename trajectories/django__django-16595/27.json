The issue suggests that the `AlterField.reduce` method does not handle instances where the operation is also an `AlterField`, leading to multiple `AlterField` operations not being reduced. This aligns with the code in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, specifically the `AlterField.reduce` method, which only checks for `RemoveField` and `RenameField` but not for another `AlterField`. Additionally, the `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` file contains the `MigrationOptimizer.optimize` method, which is relevant as it involves optimization of operations including `AlterField`. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that define and handle the reduction logic in the `AlterField` class and the optimization process in the `MigrationOptimizer` class.",
