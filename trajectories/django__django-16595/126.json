The provided search results contain the class MigrationOptimizer and its methods optimize and optimize_inner, which are directly related to the optimization process of migration operations. These methods loop through operations and attempt to reduce them if possible. The code spans identified are relevant because they show the core logic of how the optimizer tries to reduce operations, but it currently lacks the specific handling for reducing consecutive AlterField operations.

I identified the relevant code spans across different files in the Django codebase. Notably, the `AlterField` class's `reduce` method and the `MigrationOptimizer` class's `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods are crucial for understanding how the optimizer works with field operations in migrations. I then examined the `AlterField`, `AddField`, and other related field operations in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file to determine if the current implementation matches the desired behavior as per the issue. The current implementation of `AlterField.reduce` does not consider reducing multiple consecutive AlterField operations where the initial operation is also an AlterField. This behavior aligns with the reported issue and could be addressed by enhancing the `reduce` method as suggested in the issue description.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
