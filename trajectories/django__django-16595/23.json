The key elements to look for in the search results are the 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method, which is responsible for reducing or combining field operations. After analyzing the search results, I found the 'AlterField' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' with its 'reduce' method. The 'reduce' method currently only considers 'RemoveField' and 'RenameField' operations for reduction, but it does not consider 'AlterField' operations, which aligns with the issue described. Additionally, there is a 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' with its 'optimize' method, which is the main entry point for optimizing migration operations. These findings suggest that the provided search results are indeed relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
