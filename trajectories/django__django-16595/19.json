The current behavior does not reduce AlterField operations properly when they are separated from AddField within non-elidable or non-squashed migrations. The solution suggests checking if the operation is an instance of AlterField and if it is the same field operation, returning it as a single operation to fix this. The relevant files based on the provided context are `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`, and `django/db/migrations/operations/base.py`. These files contain the classes and methods that manage field operations, migration optimization, and operation management, respectively.",

The core problem seems to be that the current implementation of the AlterField.reduce method does not consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField, leading to redundant AlterField operations not being reduced.\n\nIn the search results, the relevant file to address this issue is 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py'. The code spans that are particularly relevant include:\n\n1. The definition of the AlterField class, which contains the methods for initializing, describing, and reducing AlterField operations.\n2. The AlterField.reduce method currently implemented, which needs to be modified to handle the case where the operation is another AlterField.\n3. The AddField.reduce method, which provides a template for how to handle reductions of field operations, though it currently does not handle reductions with AlterField operations.\n\nTo resolve the issue, it seems necessary to modify the AlterField.reduce method to include a check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and then decide whether to reduce or not based on the fields being the same. This modification should align with the pattern seen in other FieldOperation reductions, such as AddField.reduce.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified relevant code spans should help in addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
