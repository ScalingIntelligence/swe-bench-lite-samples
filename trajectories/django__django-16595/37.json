The user suggests that the AlterField.reduce method should consider cases where the operation is also an AlterField. \n\nUpon analyzing the search results, I found the following relevant code spans:\n\n1. In `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, the `FieldOperation` class and its subclasses (`AddField`, `RemoveField`, `AlterField`, `RenameField`) are relevant because they define the field operations and their reduction logic. Specifically:\n   - The `AddField.reduce` method currently handles reductions for FieldOperation instances, including AlterField.\n   - The `AlterField.reduce` method currently only handles reductions for RemoveField and RenameField, but does not consider other AlterField instances.\n\n2. In `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`, the `MigrationOptimizer` class and its `optimize_inner` method are relevant because they manage the optimization process for migration operations.\n\nTo address the issue, the suggested modification could be implemented in the `AlterField.reduce` method by adding a condition to handle cases where the operation is an AlterField instance. However, further analysis of the entire codebase might be necessary to ensure this modification does not introduce unexpected side effects.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
