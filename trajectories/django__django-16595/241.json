The reported issue suggests that the `AlterField.reduce` method does not currently consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField, leading to multiple AlterField operations not being reduced as expected. This requires modifications in the `AlterField` class within the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file. Specifically, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method. The search results provided include the `AlterField` class definition and its `reduce` method, which directly relates to the issue reported. We should look for any conditions or checks within the `reduce` method that might be missing the consideration for multiple AlterField operations. Based on the reported issue, it is suggested to add a condition to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and if it is the same field operation, returning [operation] in such cases. Therefore, the relevant code spans would be those that define the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method.",
