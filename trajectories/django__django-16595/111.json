Specifically, it seems that when AlterField operations follow an AddField operation, they are not being optimized as expected. The issue suggests that the AlterField.reduce method might not be considering other AlterField operations when deciding whether to reduce or optimize.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided code spans in the search results, we can see that the AddField, RemoveField, and AlterField classes are defined in the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file. The AlterField class contains a reduce method, but it currently does not consider other AlterField operations in its reduction logic, which aligns with the observed behavior in the issue.\n\nThe search results also include the MigrationOptimizer class from the django/db/migrations/optimizer.py file, which likely contains the overall logic for optimizing migration operations. The optimize method in this class iteratively attempts to optimize the operations, utilizing the reduce methods of individual operation classes, such as AlterField.\n\nBased on the issue description and the provided code, it seems likely that the relevant spans of code to address the issue are the reduce methods in the AlterField class and possibly in the related FieldOperation classes. The issue suggests adding logic to check if the operation is another AlterField and, if so, handle it accordingly to facilitate optimization.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
