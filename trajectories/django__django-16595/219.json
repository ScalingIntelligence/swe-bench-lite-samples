The user observes that when 'AlterField' operations are separated from an 'AddField' operation, the optimizer does not reduce them as expected. This leads to the suggestion of adding a conditional check in the 'reduce' method of the 'AlterField' class to handle instances where the operation being reduced is also an 'AlterField'. The search results contain the relevant code from 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', which includes the 'AlterField' class and its methods, such as '__init__' and 'reduce'. The 'reduce' method currently handles 'RemoveField' and 'RenameField', but it does not explicitly handle 'AlterField' as the user suggests it should. Based on the user's suggestion and the existing code, it seems that the existing 'reduce' method does not address the case where multiple 'AlterField' operations affecting the same field are intended to be reduced. Thus, the identified relevant code span is the 'reduce' method within the 'AlterField' class, as modifications to this method would likely address the user's concern.",
