            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a problem in the MigrationOptimizer where multiple AlterField operations are not being reduced as expected. This seems to happen when there is a separation between an AddField and subsequent AlterField operations. The issue suggests modifying the AlterField.reduce method to check if the operation is an instance of AlterField and then use the is_same_field_operation method for further evaluation.\n\nReviewing the search results, there are two main files of concern: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`. The `fields.py` file contains the definition of the AlterField class, and more specifically, the `reduce` method where the suggested modification might need to be implemented. The `optimizer.py` file contains the MigrationOptimizer class with its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods, which play a crucial role in the optimization process.\n\nFrom the provided code spans, it's clear that the current implementation of the `AlterField.reduce` method only considers RemoveField and RenameField operations for reduction. This behavior might explain why AlterField operations are not being reduced when preceded by an AddField operation. The search results also hint at the logic within `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner` that tries to optimize operations, but apparently lacks the logic to handle multiple consecutive AlterField operations as per the issue.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans for addressing the issue seem to be those within the `AlterField.reduce` method in `fields.py`, where a new condition should be added to check for and possibly reduce multiple AlterField operations. Similarly, a closer look at how the optimizer handles these operations in `optimizer.py` might also be necessary to fully address the concern.",

Upon examining the search results, key areas of interest are the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. The `reduce` method currently only handles `RemoveField` and `RenameField` operations, suggesting that the optimizer might not be equipped to handle reductions involving consecutive `AlterField` operations. This aligns with the issue, which states that multiple `AlterField` are not reduced even when they modify the same field. Additionally, the `MigrationOptimizer` class and its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` are relevant, as they orchestrate the optimization process. Together, these code spans provide a clear context for addressing the issue by evaluating and potentially modifying the reduction logic within the `AlterField` class and the broader optimization strategy in the `MigrationOptimizer` class.",

Specifically, the problem lies in the fact that AlterField operations are not being reduced when an AddField operation is present, leading to unnecessary and potentially redundant database migrations.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided context and search results, I can see that the relevant code spans are primarily located in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file. The 'AlterField' class and its 'reduce' method are particularly important, as they directly handle the reduction logic for migration operations. Additionally, the 'MigrationOptimizer' class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' is responsible for optimizing the migration operations.\n\nThe 'AlterField.reduce' method currently only handles reductions for RemoveField and RenameField operations. The suggested improvement in the issue is to add a check for AlterField operations within the 'reduce' method, which could potentially optimize the sequence of AlterField operations. This improvement would align with the goal of reducing multiple AlterField operations.\n\nGiven the context and the search results, I have identified the relevant code spans in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' that should be inspected and potentially modified to address the reported issue.",
