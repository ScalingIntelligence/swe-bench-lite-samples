The search results contain the relevant classes and methods such as AddField, AlterField, and their respective reduce methods. Notably, the AlterField.reduce method currently does not check if the operation is also an AlterField, which is the specific behavior described in the issue. This omission could be the reason why multiple AlterField operations are not being reduced as expected. The suggested change in the issue to include a check for AlterField in the reduce method seems to address this directly by consulting the is_same_field_operation method. The AddField.reduce method already checks for AlterField, but the AlterField.reduce does not, which might need modification to fit the expected behavior described. Based on these findings, the code spans involving AlterField and AddField, particularly their reduce methods, are the most relevant to the reported issue.",

The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that could be related to this issue. Given the context and the search results, the focus should be on the `AlterField` class within `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and the `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods within `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`. The `AlterField.reduce` method seems particularly relevant as it currently does not handle the case where an operation is also an AlterField, which aligns with the issue description. Additionally, the `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods are crucial for understanding how the optimizer processes operations and could potentially be where improvements are needed to address the issue. By examining these specific parts of the code, we can determine if the search results are complete or if further investigation is necessary.",
