This issue is related to the way the AlterField operation's reduce method is currently implemented and does not consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField. The provided search results from the Django codebase include relevant code spans that define the reduce methods for the AlterField and AddField classes in the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file. These methods are central to the issue's resolution as they handle how operations reduce and interact with each other during the migration optimization process. Specifically, the Reduce method of the AlterField class does not handle a scenario where an operation is also an AlterField, which is the key problem identified in the issue. Additionally, the AddField class's reduce method does handle similar operations and could serve as a reference for implementing the needed functionality in the AlterField class.",

The current implementations of these classes and their reduce methods are examined to understand the optimization logic.\n\nThe proposed change suggests adding a condition within the AlterField.reduce method to return [operation] if the operation is an instance of AlterField and an additional condition related to field operations. In the provided search results, the AlterField class and its reduce method are found in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py'. This method currently handles reduction for RemoveField and RenameField, but the presence of AlterField as an operation is not addressed.\n\nThe search results also include the MigrationOptimizer class in 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py', which is responsible for optimizing migration operations. This class and its methods are crucial for understanding the overall optimization process but do not directly address the specific issue of handling multiple AlterField operations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are associated with the AlterField class and its reduce method, as these are directly implicated in the issue of AlterField operations not being reduced when expected.

The provided search results include detailed methods and classes from Django's migration framework that handle field operations and optimizations. From the context, the AlterField.reduce method is crucial as it determines how AlterField operations are reduced, especially in relation to other field operations. The current implementation in the search results does not specifically handle the reduction of consecutive AlterField operations, which is aligned with the reported issue. The proposed solution suggests enhancing the AlterField.reduce method to consider reducing consecutive AlterFields, which could be achieved by adding a specific condition to handle such cases.",

The FieldOperation class has a method 'reduce' which serves as a base for AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField operations. However, there is no explicit logic within the provided AlterField class's 'reduce' method to optimize consecutive AlterField operations switching with another AlterField operation, as suggested in the issue description. The context provided thus partially addresses the issue but does not completely resolve or identify all relevant code, particularly the logic that would handle the reduction of consecutive AlterField operations when an AlterField immediately follows another AlterField. This indicates that while the provided code is relevant, it doesn't fully address the optimization issue described, suggesting more relevant code might exist in other parts of the migration system.",
