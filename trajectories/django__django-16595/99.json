The AlterField class's reduce method currently does not check if the operation is an instance of AlterField, which could be part of the problem.

The key part of the reported issue is the focus on the AlterField.reduce method and its handling of other AlterField instances. The provided code context and search results detail the various migration operations, including AlterField, AddField, RemoveField, and RenameField. The current implementation of AlterField.reduce does not consider the case where the operation is also an AlterField, which is in line with the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans would be those defining the AlterField class, particularly the AlterField.reduce method, and possibly any other related methods or operations handling field alterations.\n\nTo address the reported issue, we need to identify the part of the codebase that handles the reduction of AlterField operations. The relevant code spans include the AlterField class definition and its reduce method. Additionally, considering the issue's suggestion of modifying the reduce method to account for AlterField operations within AlterField, other related operations within the same file (like AddField and RemoveField) could also provide context or potential areas for modification. This holistic view of the code helps ensure we understand all interactions that could affect the reduction process.\n\nThe search results provided include the full definition of the AlterField class and its methods, including the reduce method which does not currently consider reducing AlterField with another AlterField. This is consistent with the issue report and provides the necessary code span to address the issue. Additional spans related to AddField and RemoveField are also provided to give a complete picture of field operations within migrations.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
