The primary files to focus on for addressing the issue are located in the migrations module, specifically field operations and the migration optimizer. The relevant classes include AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField in the fields.py file, as well as the MigrationOptimizer class in optimizer.py. The goal is to ensure that multiple AlterField operations are reduced appropriately, possibly by enhancing the reduce method in the AlterField class or the overall migration optimizer logic.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
