Specifically, if there's an AddField operation followed by multiple AlterField operations, the optimizer only reduces the AddField operation, leaving the subsequent AlterField operations. This suggests a need to improve the reduce method in the AlterField class. The provided search results show relevant code from django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py where the FieldOperation, AddField, AlterField, and RenameField classes are defined. Notably, the AlterField.reduce method is the focus as it currently does not consider reducing multiple AlterField operations when an AddField operation is present, which aligns with the issue report. The other files and classes are also relevant as they reference field and model operations, which could be useful in understanding the broader context and implementing a fix.",
