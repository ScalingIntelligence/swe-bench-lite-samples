The issue suggests that when attempting to optimize migrations, multiple AlterField operations are not being reduced as expected, particularly when an AddField operation is separated. The provided search results contain the relevant code in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file, specifically the 'AlterField' class. This class has several methods: '__init__', 'deconstruct', 'state_forwards', 'database_forwards', 'database_backwards', 'describe', 'migration_name_fragment', and 'reduce'. The 'reduce' method currently handles the reduction of 'RemoveField' and 'RenameField' operations, but does not handle the case where the operation is also an 'AlterField'. This omission appears to be the crux of the reported issue, as it does not consider reducing multiple 'AlterField' operations into one. The suggested solution in the report is to add a condition within the 'reduce' method to handle the case where the operation is an 'AlterField' and the field operations are the same. This addition could potentially resolve the issue of multiple 'AlterField' operations not being reduced as expected.",

This suggests that the AlterField.reduce method may not be handling the case where the operation being reduced is also an AlterField. The provided context and search results confirm the existence of the AlterField class and its reduce method in the django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py file. The reduce method currently only handles ReduceField and RenameField operations, which aligns with the user's observation that AlterField operations are not being reduced. To address this, the suggestion is to update the reduce method to handle instances where operation is an AlterField, similar to how RemoveField and RenameField are handled.
