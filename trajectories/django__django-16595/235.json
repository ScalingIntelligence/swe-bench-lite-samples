The key elements identified in the issue are the presence of multiple AlterField operations targeting the same field after an AddField operation, and the need for the optimizer to handle this scenario by reducing redundant AlterField operations into a single effective AlterField operation.\n\nThe search results provided include code spans from two files: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. These files are crucial as they contain the core logic for field operations in migrations and the optimizer logic itself.\n\nIn 'fields.py', the relevant code spans are those defining the 'AddField' and 'AlterField' classes, and their respective 'reduce' methods. The issue specifically mentions the 'AlterField.reduce' method not handling the scenario where the operation is also an 'AlterField'. The current 'AlterField.reduce' implementation checks for a 'RemoveField' or 'RenameField' but not for another 'AlterField'. This is directly relevant to the reported issue.\n\nThe 'optimizer.py' file contains the 'MigrationOptimizer' class with its 'optimize' and 'optimize_inner' methods. These methods are responsible for the actual optimization process of migration operations, making this file contextually relevant.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue, particularly the 'AlterField.reduce' method which needs to be modified or enhanced to handle reducing multiple 'AlterField' operations effectively.",

  "initial_message": "Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField\nDescription\n\t\nLet's consider the following operations: \noperations = [\n\tmigrations.AddField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\"),\n\t),\n\tmigrations.AlterField(\n\t\tmodel_name=\"book\",\n\t\tname=\"title\",\n\t\tfield=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text=\"help\", default=None),\n\t),\n]\nIf I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
