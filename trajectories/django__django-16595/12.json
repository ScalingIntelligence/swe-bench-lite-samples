The code spans provided in the search results include the classes AddField, AlterField, and FieldOperation from 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and the MigrationOptimizer class from 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py'. These classes are directly related to the operations that can be performed during migrations and how they can be optimized. The specific method of interest is AlterField.reduce, which currently does not consider reducing AlterField operations when the previous operation is also an AlterField. This aligns with the issue reported and suggests that this is the area where the code could be modified to address the problem.",

This aligns with the reported issue that suggests adding a check within the reduce method to handle this specific case. The MigrationOptimizer class also includes the optimization logic, which iterates through operations and applies reductions where possible. The provided file context does not include the exact suggestion from the issue to add a check for an AlterField operation within the reduce method of AlterField, but it clearly shows the need for such an addition.
