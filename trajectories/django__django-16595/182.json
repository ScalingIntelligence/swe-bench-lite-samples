The current implementation in the optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField operations when an AddField operation is separated. This may indicate a gap in the reduce method of the AlterField class or the optimization logic in the MigrationOptimizer class. To address this, I'll focus the search on the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/migrations/optimizer.py' files specifically, as they contain the relevant code for field operations and the migration optimization process. I'll also consider the base Operation class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/base.py' as it defines the reduce method that might be inherited by AlterField. Given the specific problem mentioned ('AlterField.reduce does not consider the case where operation is also an AlterField'), I'll structure my search around these classes and methods directly.",

I found the 'alter_field' method in 'ProjectState' class in 'django/db/migrations/state.py', which handles the alteration of fields in the project state. This method seems relevant for handling the first AlterField operation. Additionally, in the 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py', the 'generate_altered_fields' method also deals with altering fields and might include the logic for subsequent AlterField operations. The 'generate_altered_fields' method explicitly checks if the fields have changed and then constructs the AlterField operation accordingly. It seems relevant to handle the scenario of multiple AlterField operations without reduction, as it involves comparing old and new fields and generating migrations. Given these methods, it would be beneficial to ensure that code spans 3, 4, and 5 from 'state.py' and span 8 from 'autodetector.py' are aligned with the optimization logic suggested in the user's reported issue, which aims to handle multiple AlterField operations better.

The current file context and the new search results focus on the `MigrationAutodetector` class and specifically on the `generate_altered_fields` method, which deals with the alteration of fields. This method checks for changes in fields and generates the corresponding AlterField operations. However, the issue suggests that the optimizer does not handle subsequent AlterField operations well if they follow an AddField operation. The search results do not provide explicit code handling the optimizer's behavior towards multiple AlterField operations following an AddField, suggesting a potential gap in the codebase that needs addressing. It's crucial to find or implement logic that can handle this specific case, potentially similar to the suggested logic: `if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation): return [operation]`. The current code analysis does not reveal where this handling might be implemented or adjusted, indicating a need for further code examination or addition to manage this scenario effectively.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
