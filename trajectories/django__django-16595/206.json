The current context provided a detailed view of the existing FieldOperation classes and their methods in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file. The issue specifically points out that the AlterField.reduce method does not currently consider reducing multiple AlterField operations into a single operation, which could be a missing feature or an intended behavior not documented. The suggested addition to the AlterField.reduce method aims to address this by checking if the incoming operation is also an AlterField and if it pertains to the same field, before deciding to include it in the reduction results.\n\nThe new search results show more context within the MigrationOptimizer class in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`, particularly the `optimize_inner` method, which directly manages the process of reducing operations. It iterates through each operation and attempts to reduce it with subsequent operations. This provides insights into how operations are currently being optimized.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the need to handle multiple AlterField operations better, the relevant code spans in the search results are the `optimize_inner` method, which is the core optimization routine, and potentially the immediate area where a new optimization check for AlterField reducing could be implemented. Thus, the identified span from the new results includes the `optimize_inner` method.",
