The specific complaint is that when AlterField operations are separated from AddField operations, they are not reduced as expected.\n\nThe search results include several relevant files and code spans within the Django codebase, notably in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`, and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`.\n\nIn `fields.py`, the `AlterField` class and its `reduce` method are significant. The current implementation of `AlterField.reduce` does not consider the case where the operation is another `AlterField`. This is directly related to the issue, as it suggests the addition of a condition to handle this scenario.\n\nThe `MigrationOptimizer` class in `optimizer.py` is also relevant, as it contains the logic for optimizing migration operations. The `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods manage the reduction process of migration operations.\n\nIn `models.py`, various model-related migration operations are defined, such as `CreateModel`, `RenameModel`, and others. These operations could be affected by the issue indirectly, as they involve model fields.\n\nBased on these findings, the relevant code spans are in the `AlterField.reduce` method in `fields.py` and the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `optimizer.py`. These areas directly address the issue of optimizing AlterField operations and the overall migration optimization process.",
