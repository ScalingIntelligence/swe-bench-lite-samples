The user observes that when an AddField operation is separated from multiple AlterField operations, the optimizer fails to reduce the AlterField operations effectively, leaving them in the migration plan. This suggests a need to enhance the AlterField.reduce method to handle cases where the operation is also an AlterField.\n\nThe search results provided include code spans from the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, particularly focusing on the `AlterField` class. Key methods like `__init__`, `deconstruct`, `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, `database_backwards`, `describe`, `migration_name_fragment`, and `reduce` are relevant to understanding how AlterField operations are currently handled and potentially where improvements could be made. The current implementation of the `reduce` method handles specific cases (like RemoveField and RenameField), but it does not currently check for another AlterField as the operation. This omission aligns with the user's observation and proposed solution.\n\nThe `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` file provides context on how the optimizer functions at a higher level, with `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods that drive the optimization process. However, the immediate fix suggested by the user, which involves modifying the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class, is reflected in the relevant code spans from `fields.py`, making these spans a direct match for addressing the reported issue.\n\nGiven the details of the issue and the context provided by the search results, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those from the `AlterField` class in `fields.py`, especially the `reduce` method, as indicated by the user's suggested fix.",

However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:\noptimizer.optimize(operations[1:], \"books\") \n[<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,\n <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]\nIndeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField. \nIs this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented? \nOtherwise, would it make sense to add something like\n\t\tif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(\n\t\t\toperation\n\t\t):\n\t\t\treturn [operation]\n"
