The search results provide valuable context by showing the implementation of the QuerySet class methods relevant to the issue. These methods include .__init__(), .union(), .annotate(), and .distinct(). \n\n1. Analysis shows that the .distinct() method is responsible for marking the QuerySet as requiring distinct results. However, it does not check if the queryset was derived from a union operation, which might be the root cause of the issue. \n\n2. The .annotate() method adds fields or expressions to the queryset, potentially influencing how distinct operates. \n\n3. The .union() method merges multiple querysets, which is directly involved in the scenario of the reported issue. \n\nThe relevance of these methods to the issue is clear, as they directly involve the chaining of operations that are part of the problem described. Specifically, the issue of .distinct() not behaving as expected following .union() is central to the problem. By examining the code spans for these methods, we gain insight into Django's internal behavior and potential areas for improvement or fault exploration regarding the reported issue.",

The new search results in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` provide the `SQLCompiler.get_distinct` method which details how the distinct fields are processed.

The issue specifically notes that after annotating two different querysets and then combining them with `.union()`, the `.distinct()` method fails to operate as expected. From the context and the provided search results, we can identify several key code spans that are directly related to the functionality in question: the `QuerySet.union()`, `QuerySet.annotate()`, and `QuerySet.distinct()` methods in `django/db/models/query.py`, as well as the `Query.add_distinct_fields()` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.
