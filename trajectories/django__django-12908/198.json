The distinct() method does not seem to affect the queryset as expected. To address this, we should focus on the implementation of the union() and distinct() methods in Django's QuerySet class and related SQL compilation logic. Specifically, we should investigate how these methods handle distinct on combined querysets and ensure that the distinct() method is correctly applying distinct filters post-union. This involves looking at the methods like _combinator_query, union, intersection, difference, annotate, and distinct in the QuerySet class, as well as get_combinator_sql and get_distinct in the SQLCompiler class, and possibly the combine and add_distinct_fields methods in the Query class.",
