The expectation is that `.distinct()` would affect the union queryset, but it seems not to be working as expected. From the provided context, it appears that the relevant code could be found within the `QuerySet` methods of `union`, `annotate`, and `distinct`, or within the `SQLCompiler` methods handling `get_combinator_sql` and `get_distinct`. Additionally, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` might contain the logic for adding distinct fields. Therefore, the search should focus on these specific methods and classes within the provided files to understand the behavior and possibly identify the missing functionality or a bug.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the behavior of .union() and .distinct() on annotated querysets in Django's ORM. The user expects that using .distinct() after .union() on annotated querysets should affect the queryset, but it doesn't. To address this, I need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle these operations.\n\nFrom the <file_context>, I see important spans like QuerySet.union, QuerySet.annotate, and QuerySet.distinct in the django/db/models/query.py file. These spans handle the core functionalities related to union, annotation, and distinct operations on querysets.\n\nIn the <search_results>, additional spans are found in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py and django/db/models/sql/query.py, particularly SQLCompiler.get_combinator_sql and SQLCompiler.get_distinct, which handle SQL generation for combinator operations and distinct clauses respectively. The Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py also contains methods like Query.combine and Query.add_annotation which are relevant for combining querysets and adding annotations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant spans are in these files and cover the essential parts of the ORM dealing with union, annotation, and distinct operations. These spans should be sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue where .distinct() does not affect the queryset after using .union() and .annotate().",
