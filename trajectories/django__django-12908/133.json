The distinct() method does not appear to function as expected in this context. This issue may be related to how Django's ORM processes distinct() calls after certain operations on QuerySets. To identify the root cause, a detailed review of the union(), annotate(), and distinct() method implementations in the Django ORM is necessary. Focusing on the methods defined in django/db/models/query.py, django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, and django/db/models/sql/query.py is crucial to understand query combination and distinct operations. Additionally, understanding the role of aggregates and annotations might also be relevant, considering the use of annotate() in the issue. Hence, the search parameters should specifically target these areas of the codebase.",
