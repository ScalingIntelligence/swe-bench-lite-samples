The relevant methods to investigate are union(), annotate(), and distinct() in QuerySet, and get_combinator_sql() in SQLCompiler.

The expected behavior is for `.distinct()` to effectively filter out duplicates, but it appears not to be working as expected. The key elements in the issue involve the `QuerySet.union`, `QuerySet.annotate`, and `QuerySet.distinct` methods within the Django ORM. The provided search results include these methods in the `django/db/models/query.py` file. Additionally, there is involvement of the `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which is crucial for understanding the SQL compilation process and how the `union` method is handled. The analysis of these code spans reveals that they directly relate to the operations described in the reported issue. The `QuerySet.union` method combines querysets, the `QuerySet.annotate` method annotates them, and the `QuerySet.distinct` method attempts to apply distinct functionality. Given this detailed analysis, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
