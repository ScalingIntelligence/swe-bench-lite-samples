The issue describes that after annotating two different querysets and then using `.union()`, the `.distinct()` method does not affect the queryset as expected. This aligns with the need to understand how the `union` and `distinct` methods interact within the Django ORM.\n\nIn the file context, we have seen relevant code spans in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which include the `QuerySet.union` and `QuerySet.distinct` methods, as well as the `Query` class that handles the underlying SQL query construction. These are crucial for understanding the core functionality related to the issue.\n\nIn the new search results, additional relevant code spans are found in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which include the `SQLCompiler.get_combinator_sql` and `SQLCompiler.get_distinct` methods. These methods are essential for generating the SQL for combined queries (like unions) and applying distinct fields, respectively. These methods provide deeper insight into how the ORM constructs and compiles SQL queries, which is crucial for diagnosing and potentially fixing the reported issue.\n\nThe identified spans provide a comprehensive view of the relevant code sections dealing with the union and distinct functionalities, indicating that the search results are relevant and complete for addressing the reported issue.",

The issue is that `.distinct()` does not seem to affect the queryset as expected.\n2. Current file context indicates that we already have identified relevant parts in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, specifically touching on initialization, union, and distinct methods within the QuerySet class.\n3. New search results further expand on these areas, adding the `annotate` method and its interplay with `distinct` and `union` in `django/db/models/query.py`. Additionally, they provide more context around the SQLCompiler class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`.\n4. Upon analyzing these new spans: \n   - 'QuerySet.annotate' shows the method for annotating querysets, which is directly relevant given the issue's focus on annotated querysets.\n   - 'Query.add_annotation' and 'Query.add_distinct_fields' in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` are crucial as they reveal how annotations and distinct fields are added to the query, impacting the union operation.\n   - 'SQLCompiler.get_combinator_sql' and 'SQLCompiler.get_distinct' in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` are important as they deal with SQL compilation for combinator operations and managing distinct fields, respectively.\n5. Overall, these new code spans align well with the reported issue and provide necessary context to understand how annotations, unions, and distinct operations interact within Django's ORM.",
