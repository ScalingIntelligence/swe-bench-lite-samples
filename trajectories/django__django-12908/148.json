The focus is on ensuring that the `.distinct()` method properly deduplicates the unioned queryset. Upon reviewing the provided `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files, it's clear that the methods `.annotate()`, `.union()`, and `.distinct()` are all present and seem relevant to the issue. The `QuerySet.distinct` method sets the `distinct` flag and the `distinct_fields` in the `Query` object, which is expected to control the deduplication behavior. The `QuerySet.union` method combines querysets, and the `QuerySet.annotate` method adds annotations to the queryset. However, the issue suggests that the `.distinct()` method is not working as expected when used after `.union()`. Importantly, the `QuerySet._combinator_query` method, which handles the combination of querysets using operators like `UNION`, is also found in the provided context. This method appears crucial for understanding how the combination of querysets might interact with the `distinct` functionality. Given the context and the code spans provided, these methods are directly implicated in the issue's concerns. Therefore, the following code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
