We have insights into how the `.union()` method is implemented in the `QuerySet` class, which combines multiple querysets. Similarly, the `.distinct()` method is implemented in the same class, which marks the queryset as distinct and adds distinct fields to the query. Looking at the `Query` class, there are methods that manage distinct fields and combine queries. In the `SQLCompiler` class, the `get_combinator_sql` method handles the SQL generation for union operations. Given this comprehensive understanding, it seems appropriate to delve into code snippets that detail how these methods interact when invoked in conjunction. Particularly, the focus should be on identifying where `.distinct()` is expected to affect the output of `.union()`, and perhaps locate any overlooked edge cases or inconsistencies.",

The provided search results include relevant code spans from `django/db/models/query.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. These files contain the implementations of `QuerySet`, `Query`, and `SQLCompiler` classes, respectively. The key methods involved are `QuerySet.union()`, `QuerySet.distinct()`, `Query.combine()`, `Query.add_distinct_fields()`, and `SQLCompiler.get_combinator_sql()`. These methods handle the union of query sets, the addition of distinct fields, and the generation of SQL for combinator operations. The analysis of the issue will focus on identifying whether these methods correctly handle the combination and distinction of querysets as required by the reported issue. The relevance of each code span is assessed based on its direct interaction with or influence over the mentioned methods and their handling of distinct fields and union operations.",

Additionally, the Query class manages distinct fields and query combinations, indicating a fundamental part of the Django ORM's query composition. Furthermore, the SQLCompiler shows SQL generation for union operations, completing the picture on how union SQL instructions translate into executed code during runtime. Given the comprehensive nature of the code segments, they eloquently illustrate the functional foundations related to union and distinct operation handling in Django's ORM. As such, it seems all relevant code context has been sufficiently provided to understand and analyze the combining querysets, annotating them differently, and then applying the distinct operation to get the unique results.
