Therefore, these code spans are likely where the issue described in the reported issue could be addressed or further investigated.

To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the `.union()` and `.distinct()` methods in Django's ORM. From the file context, we have already identified the relevant spans for `QuerySet.union`, `QuerySet.annotate`, and `QuerySet.distinct` in `django/db/models/query.py`, as well as the `Query.add_distinct_fields` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The new search results in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` provide additional context on how the SQLCompiler handles the combination of querysets with `get_combinator_sql` and how it manages the distinct fields with `get_distinct`. These additional spans are relevant because they show how the SQLCompiler processes the union and distinct operations, which aligns with the reported issue.
