The search results provide several relevant code spans: \n\n1. `QuerySet.union`: This method is responsible for combining querysets and is directly related to the union operation mentioned in the issue. It handles the combination logic and ensures that the union operation is performed correctly. \n2. `QuerySet.annotate`: This method is used to add annotations to the queryset, which is a key part of the issue as it involves annotating two different querysets. The method ensures that the annotations are added correctly and handles conflicts if they arise. \n3. `QuerySet.distinct`: This method is used to apply the distinct clause to the queryset. The issue reports that the distinct operation doesn't work after using union and annotate, so understanding this method is crucial. \n4. `SQLCompiler.get_combinator_sql`: This method is responsible for generating SQL for combined queries, which includes the UNION operation. Understanding how this method handles the combination and distinct operations is essential for addressing the issue. \n5. `Query.add_annotation` and `Query.add_distinct_fields`: These methods are involved in managing annotations and distinct fields, respectively. Examining these methods can provide insight into how annotations and distinct operations are managed internally. \n\nThese code spans collectively cover the key aspects of the issue, including annotation, union, and distinct operations.
