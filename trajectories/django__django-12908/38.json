This suggests that the problem could lie in the implementation details of .union() and .distinct() within Django's ORM. It's likely that the relevant code resides primarily in the django/db/models/query.py, django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, and django/db/models/sql/query.py files. The focus should be on methods like .union(), .annotate(), .distinct(), and related internal methods handling query combinations and distinct selections. Additionally, knowing that .annotate() on different querysets before .union() affects .distinct() behavior can guide the search to look deeper into how annotations and unions are managed.",

From the existing file context and search results, we can identify multiple relevant code spans within the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py`. These code spans include the `QuerySet.__init__`, `QuerySet.order_by`, `QuerySet.distinct`, `QuerySet._combinator_query`, `QuerySet.union`, `QuerySet.intersection`, and `QuerySet.difference` methods. The `QuerySet.union` method is particularly relevant as it handles the union of querysets, and it uses the `_combinator_query` method to prepare the query for combining results. Furthermore, many additional code spans from the `QuerySet` class seem relevant to the issue but require additional inspection. \n\nBased on this, our task is to find all directly related code, which implies searching for code related to `__init__`, `order_by`, `distinct`, `union`, nested functions, local variables, and other code emitting or transforming sql within functions for criteria, and summary calls. Before closing, we would be performing a complete coverage check to hopefully uncover new issue boundaries. However, we do not have the capability to check thoroughly.
