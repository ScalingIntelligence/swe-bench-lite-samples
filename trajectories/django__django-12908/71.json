The expected behavior is for the `.distinct()` method to work as expected, possibly requiring changes in the Django ORM.\n\nStep 2: Review current context\nNo relevant code has been identified yet.\n\nStep 3: Process new search results\n - We found the `Query` class which has methods to handle distinct fields and annotations. This seems relevant as it directly handles the distinct and annotation functionality. The `add_distinct_fields` method directly adds distinct fields.\n - The `SQLCompiler` class and its `get_distinct` method also appear relevant, as they compile SQL for distinctness.\n - The `QuerySet` class methods, particularly `distinct`, `union`, and `annotate`, perform actions that are directly related to the operations discussed in the issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, these parts of the code are relevant to the reported issue as they directly deal with the union, annotation, and distinct operations.\n\nStep 4: Respond to the Function\nUsing the `Identify` function to respond with the identified spans.\n",
