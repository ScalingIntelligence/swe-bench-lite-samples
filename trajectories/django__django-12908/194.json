The issue states that .distinct() does not affect the queryset as expected when used after combining querysets with .union() and adding annotations. This discrepancy needs to be investigated in the context of Django's QuerySet implementation. The provided file context and search results both refer to the 'django/db/models/query.py' file, which is the core file for handling queryset operations in Django. Significant spans of code related to the QuerySet class, including the methods .union(), .annotate(), and .distinct(), are identified. These methods are directly relevant to the issue reported. Analyzing these methods shows that the .distinct() method is responsible for marking the queryset to use DISTINCT in its SQL query, but there seems to be an issue when it's used in combination with .union(). This indicates that the main problem lies within how Django handles the combination of these operations. The key spans of code that need further analysis are those related to the .union() and .distinct() methods to understand their interaction and to potentially identify a bug that prevents .distinct() from working correctly after .union(). Therefore, the identified spans of code from the provided search results specifically around the implementation of the .union() and .distinct() methods are crucial for addressing the reported issue.",
