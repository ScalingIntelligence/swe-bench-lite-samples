This involves understanding how the `add_distinct_fields` method in the `Query` class works, particularly after operations like `union` and `annotate`. The current implementation of `annotate` in `QuerySet` shows that it validates and adds annotations while ensuring there are no conflicts, which suggests that the problem might not be in the addition of annotations but in how they are processed or represented when `distinct` is called. Checking the `distinct` method and how it interacts with the annotations and union results could reveal the root cause of the issue.",
