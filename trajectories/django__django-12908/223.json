The issue describes that after performing these operations, distinct() is not working as expected. The search results provided relevant code spans for the QuerySet class, specifically focusing on methods like union(), annotate(), and distinct().\n\nFrom the provided code spans, it is evident that the QuerySet class defines these methods explicitly. The union() method is responsible for creating a new QuerySet that combines the results of multiple querysets. The annotate() method is used to add new fields to the queryset by annotating each row with additional data computed on-the-fly. The distinct() method ensures that the queryset contains distinct rows based on specified fields.\n\nThe code analysis shows that annotate() can modify the queryset by adding annotations, and distinct() sets the distinct property and fields. However, the issue reported might be related to how these methods work in combination, particularly with the union() method, as the distinctness is not enforced as expected. The issue might require further investigation into the interaction between these methods or potentially a deeper look into how the Django ORM handles combinations of these querysets. Given that QuerySet defines these specific methods and their functionalities match the operations stated in the issue, these code spans are highly relevant.\n\nWith these code spans, it seems to address the reported issue directly by providing the core implementations of the methods under concern. This suggests that the search results have effectively captured the relevant parts of the codebase related to the issue at hand. Additionally, the Query class in the same codebase also plays a role in the internal mechanisms of Django's ORM, which could indirectly impact how distinct() works after union() operations, casting further light on the possible source of the issue.",
