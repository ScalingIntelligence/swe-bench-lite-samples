Additionally, examining the SQL query generation logic in the SQLCompiler and Query classes is necessary to understand how distinct and union are being processed.",

The issue outlines that after using .annotate() on two different querysets and then applying the .union(), the .distinct() method is ineffective. According to the expected outcome, the distinct operation should apply across the union of the annotated querysets.\n\nIn the provided file context, I observed several relevant code spans within the QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py. These spans include the union(), annotate(), and distinct() methods. The initialization of the QuerySet class and the handling of distinct_fields within the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py were also notable.\n\nIn the new search results, the SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py contains methods like get_combinator_sql() and get_distinct(), which manage the SQL combination and explicit distinct handling in the query. The Query class methods like combine() and add_distinct_fields() in django/db/models/sql/query.py are also critical, as they manage the combination of queries and the distinct fields.\n\nFrom the information provided, the following code spans are highly relevant to the issue:\n\n1. In django/db/models/query.py: The QuerySet.union(), QuerySet.annotate(), and QuerySet.distinct() methods.\n2. In django/db/models/sql/compiler.py: The SQLCompiler.get_combinator_sql() and SQLCompiler.get_distinct() methods.\n3. In django/db/models/sql/query.py: The Query.combine() and Query.add_distinct_fields() methods.\n\nThese code spans collectively address the creation of union queries, annotation, and ensuring distinct operation, all of which are central to the reported issue.
