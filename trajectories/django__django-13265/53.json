The error occurs because '_order' field is not yet created when AddIndex operation is executed. To resolve this, we need to ensure AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before AddIndex concerning '_order'. The relevant operations are defined in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. We also need to look into 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' to understand how migration operations are sorted and applied. Additionally, checking 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/options.py' will provide insights into how model options and ordering are handled.",
