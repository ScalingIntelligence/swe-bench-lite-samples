Specific attention should be given to operations related to altering the order with respect to a field (`AlterOrderWithRespectTo`) and adding an index to that field (`AddIndex`). The problem is that the index on '_order' is being added before the '_order' field itself is created, leading to a crash. To solve this, we need to ensure that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is processed before `AddIndex` involving '_order'. We should search for the implementation of these operations to understand their internal logic and how they interact with the database schema.",

This error occurs because '_order' field has not been created yet when the AddIndex operation is executed. To address this, we need to understand the sequence of operations in the Django migration process and how AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex interact with the database schema. The provided search results from 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' contain the relevant classes and methods for both AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations. These operations are crucial for managing the ordering and indexing of fields in Django models. Specifically, the code spans for AlterOrderWithRespectTo's __init__, state_forwards, database_forwards, database_backwards, references_field, describe, and migration_name_fragment methods, as well as AddIndex's __init__, state_forwards, database_forwards, database_backwards, deconstruct, describe, and migration_name_fragment methods are identified as relevant because they directly deal with the logic of how these operations are executed on the database. By analyzing these methods, we can understand the internal workings of these operations and why the order of operations is critical in this context.",
