The key point is that AlterOrderWithRespectTo depends on the '_order' field being created before it can be used in an index. To resolve this, we should look into how Django's migration operations are applied and managed to ensure that the '_order' field is created first before any index can use it. Based on the files listed, the Django source files involved with migrations are expected to be in or related to the 'django/db/migrations' directory. Specifically, we should focus on operations related to ModelOperation, AlterOrderWithRespectTo, and AddIndex to understand how they interact and their ordering in the migration process.",
