Specifically, the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation fails because the '_order' field has not been created yet when an AddIndex operation involving '_order' is performed. To fix this, we need to ensure that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before AddIndex for the '_order' field. To identify the relevant code, we should focus on the django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file, which contains the definitions for AddIndex and AlterOrderWithRespectTo operations. Additionally, examining the django/db/migrations/autodetector.py file will help understand how migration operations are sorted and generated.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue relates to a specific sequence of migration operations in Django, where the _order field, which is created by the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation, is causing a crash when included in an Index via the AddIndex operation. The core problem is that the _order field does not yet exist when the AddIndex is processed, leading to the crash. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the Django migrations framework that handle these operations. In the provided search results, we find these operations in the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file. Specifically, the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class is responsible for managing the `order_with_respect_to` option, and it includes methods like `state_forwards` and `database_forwards` that manipulate the state and database schema to include the _order field. The `AddIndex` class is responsible for adding indexes to the database and includes methods like `state_forwards` and `database_forwards` to do so. The relevant code spans are those that define these classes and their methods, as they are directly involved in the operations that the reported issue is concerned with. Additionally, the `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file contains the `MigrationAutodetector` class, which is responsible for detecting changes and generating migration operations. The method `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to` is particularly relevant as it deals with the generation of AlterOrderWithRespectTo operations based on model changes. These code spans provide the necessary context to understand how the AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations interact and how the _order field is handled in Django's migration framework.",
