            "scratch_pad": "I analyzed the reported issue which involves the problematic order of operations between 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' and 'AddIndex' for the '_order' field in a Django model. The issue states that the '_order' field must exist before the index can be added, hence 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' should precede 'AddIndex'.\n\nThe search results include code spans from two files: 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. These files contain the classes and methods responsible for detecting changes and applying operations during migrations in Django.\n\nIn 'autodetector.py', there are methods related to detecting changes, sorting migrations, and adding operations. The '_detect_changes' method could be relevant as it detects changes in the schema. The 'generate_altered_order_with_respect_to' method, which checks for changes in the 'order_with_respect_to' option, is particularly relevant as it directly addresses the issue reported.\n\nIn 'models.py', the 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' class and its methods define how the 'order_with_respect_to' option is altered during migrations. Its 'database_forwards' method is crucial as it determines how the '_order' field is added or removed in the database schema. The 'AddIndex' class and its methods, particularly 'database_forwards', add indexes to models, which is the operation that fails due to the '_order' field not being present.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are from the 'generate_altered_order_with_respect_to' method in 'autodetector.py' and the 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' and 'AddIndex' classes in 'models.py'. These are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the issue reported.",
