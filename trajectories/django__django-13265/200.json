The issue is that the `_order` field, which is created by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, is referenced in an index added by `AddIndex`, but the field creation hasn't completed when the index is added, causing a crash. Analyzing the provided code spans, it's clear that the relevant parts are those related to `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex`. The `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class and its `database_forwards` method are of particular interest since they deal directly with the creation and management of the `_order` field. The `AddIndex` class similarly has methods dealing with state transitions and database operations related to indexes, covering the scenario where the `_order` field is included in an index. Understanding these operations could help avoid the reported crash by ensuring that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is executed before `AddIndex` or by refactoring the migration to handle field and index creation in the correct order.",
