Specifically, the error arises when the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation is executed after the AddIndex operation for the '_order' field. This error occurs because the '_order' field has not been created yet when the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation is attempted. To resolve this, we need to identify the code responsible for ordering operations in Django migrations and ensure that the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation is executed before the AddIndex operation for the '_order' field.",

This requires careful examination of the relevant code spans that deal with migration operations and their order. The provided search results include operations like AddIndex, AlterOrderWithRespectTo, and how they are handled in the migration process. The goal is to identify the parts of the code that specifically deal with these operations and their execution order to understand how the order of these operations can lead to issues as reported in the <issue> tag. The analysis of the spans in django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py and django/db/migrations/autodetector.py is particularly crucial as they define and handle these operations respectively. Additionally, looking at how these operations are added and optimized in the migration process in django/db/migrations/autodetector.py will provide further insight into the reported issue.",
