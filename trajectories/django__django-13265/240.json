            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the order of operations in Django migrations when using `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex`. Specifically, the error arises because the '_order' field, which is created by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, is not available when `AddIndex` is executed, leading to a crash. To resolve this, the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation needs to be executed before the `AddIndex` operation involving the '_order' field.\n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant code spans are found in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. These spans deal with the definition and generation of migration operations, including `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex`.\n\n1. In `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, the `generate_created_models` method shows how models are processed and how operations like `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` are added. Specifically, the method determines the order of these operations and their dependencies.\n\n2. The `generate_added_indexes` and `generate_removed_indexes` methods in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` handle the addition and removal of indexes, including the '_order' field.\n\n3. In `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class represents the operation to alter the order with respect to a specific field. This class includes methods for deconstructing, state forwarding, and executing the operation on the database.\n\n4. The `AddIndex` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` represents the operation to add an index to a model, which includes handling the '_order' field.\n\nGiven the issue, it's clear that the order of operations in the migration sequence needs to ensure that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` precedes `AddIndex` for the '_order' field. The relevant code spans from the search results provide the necessary details to understand and potentially resolve the issue.",
