The error occurs because the '_order' field, required by AlterOrderWithRespectTo, is not yet created when AddIndex is processed. To resolve this, we need to understand the order of operations in Django migrations and how to control it. The problem seems to be related to the sequence of migrations generated by Django's migration framework. Therefore, the search should focus on the migration operations, particularly AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex, and the methods that manage their sequence in migration files.",

The primary concern is the sequence of operations in the migration file, specifically the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation following the AddIndex operation for '_order'. To address this, we need to ensure that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before the AddIndex operation involving '_order'. The search results provide insights into the Django migration operations, specifically focusing on AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex. The relevant code spans from the search results include the initialization, state transformation, and database operations for both AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex, which helps in understanding how these operations affect the database and model states. By carefully analyzing these code spans, we can identify the points at which the '_order' field is managed and the sequence in which operations should be executed to avoid conflicts. This analysis will guide in determining the relevant code spans to solve the reported issue.",
