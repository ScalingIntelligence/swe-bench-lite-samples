This is confirmed by examining the relevant code spans in the migration operations file. The code spans 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' and 'AddIndex' contain methods and properties that are directly related to the operations mentioned in the issue. Specifically, the 'database_forwards' method in 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' and 'AddIndex' deal with adding and removing fields and indexes respectively, which is in line with the problem described. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to resolving the reported issue.",
