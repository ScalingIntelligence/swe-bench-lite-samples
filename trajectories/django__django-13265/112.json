The issue specifically points out that the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation should proceed before the `AddIndex` operation for `_order`. From the provided search results, I can see that `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` contains the definitions for both `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex`. These definitions include the necessary methods for handling the state and database forwards and backwards operations for these migrations. In `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, there's a method `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to` that specifically handles the generation of `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operations in the migration process. This confirms that the current codebase already has the necessary operations defined to handle these migration changes, but the order of operations in the migration file needs to be adjusted to ensure that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is executed before `AddIndex` for `_order`.",

Similarly, the AddIndex operation is also detailed in the same file, showing how it adds an index to a model in the database. The issue suggests that the order of these operations matters, which is supported by the observation that the '_order' field must exist before an index can be added to it.
