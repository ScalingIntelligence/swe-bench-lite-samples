Specifically, the error occurs because the '_order' field, which is created by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, is referenced in the `AddIndex` operation before it is created. To resolve this, we need to ensure that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` runs before `AddIndex` for the '_order' field. The relevant files to investigate are those related to migration operations and model definition, particularly 'models.py', 'schema.py', and 'state.py' which handle model options and database schema changes.",

The relevant code spans from the search results that pertain to this issue are primarily in the migration operations related to AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex. These operations are crucial because they handle how '_order' is added and managed when altering the order with respect to a field. Specifically, 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo.database_forwards' and 'AddIndex.database_forwards' contain logic that potentially interacts during migration execution, which could lead to the described crash if the sequence of operations is not correctly ordered. The 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' class and its methods indicate how the '_order' field is managed and interact with the database schema, while 'AddIndex' involves adding indexes to the database schema. This analysis suggests that the order in which these operations are executed in the migration file could be critical to prevent the crash. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the issue.",
