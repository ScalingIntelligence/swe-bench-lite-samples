The error occurs because the '_order' field is referenced before it is created. The solution involves ensuring that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before any AddIndex operations that include '_order'. To address this, I need to identify the relevant parts of Django's migration framework that handle these operations and their order of execution. I will focus my search on the migration operations and the auto-detection logic that determines the sequence of migration operations.",

The user has identified that the _order field needs to be created before adding the index for '_order'. The provided search results include relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' that define the AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations. These operations are critical to understanding how the order with respect to a field is altered and how an index is added to a model. Specifically, the definitions for AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex's state_forwards and database_forwards methods are crucial as they handle the state and database changes for these operations. Additionally, the AddIndex operation's __init__ method ensures that an index name is provided, which is relevant to the error described. The search results also include 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py', which shows the logic used to sort and add operations, although not directly related to the issue of order and index addition sequence, it provides context on how operations are managed and potentially how they could be reordered if necessary. Overall, the relevant code spans include those defining and modifying the state and database for AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations, which are central to resolving the reported issue.",
