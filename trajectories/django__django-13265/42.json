The issue arises because the '_order' field has not been created yet when AlterOrderWithRespectTo() is executed, leading to a dependency problem. The correct order of operations should be to create '_order' field before adding an index on it. The search results contain relevant code spans that define the operations AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex. Specifically, the spans in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' that define AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex are crucial for understanding the implementation of these operations. Additionally, the 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' file contains the logic for generating these operations, which is also relevant to understanding the process of operation generation and their order. By examining these spans, we can identify the code responsible for the operations and potentially identify the sequence dependency issue causing the crash.
