The reported issue describes a crash when using `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` with a `ForeignKey` and including `_order` in an `Index`. The issue indicates that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` must be executed before `AddIndex` for `_order`. The search results provide detailed code for `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations in Django's migration framework. These operations manipulate the database schema, and their internals need to be understood to address the issue. The detailed functions for both operations are present, showing how they modify the database state. Key functions to focus on from `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` are `database_forwards`, `state_forwards`, and `__init__`, which deal directly with the underlying database changes. For `AddIndex`, the functions `database_forwards`, `state_forwards`, and `__init__` are critical as they describe how an index is added to the database. The identified code spans are relevant because they capture the core logic and processes involved in both operations, which are necessary to understand and resolve the issue reported.",
