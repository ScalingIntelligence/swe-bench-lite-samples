            "scratch_pad": "The issue describes a problem with the order of operations in Django migrations when using `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations. Specifically, the error occurs because `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is attempting to use the `_order` field before it has been created, as indicated by the `AddIndex` operation. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is executed before `AddIndex` that includes the `_order` field. This suggests a need to review the Django migration operations and potentially adjust their order. We should focus our search on the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations, as well as the logic handling the order of migration operations in Django.",

Specifically, the 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' operation is executed after the 'AddIndex' operation for the '_order' field, which is causing the crash because the '_order' field hasn't been created yet when 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' tries to reference it. The solution would be to ensure that 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' is executed before any 'AddIndex' operations that reference the '_order' field.\n\nReviewing the search results, there are several relevant sections:\n1. 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' section in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' outlines the operation for setting the 'order_with_respect_to' attribute and the steps it takes, including modifying the database schema. This is directly related to the issue.\n2. The 'AddIndex' section in the same file is relevant as it defines how indexes are added to models, specifically focusing on the '_order' field in the case of the reported issue.\n3. The 'AddField' section in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' is also relevant as it outlines how fields are added to models, which could potentially explain why the '_order' field isn't available when needed.\n\nGiven these findings, I will mark the relevant code spans identified in the search results.",
