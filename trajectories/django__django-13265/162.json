            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a crash when using `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` with `ForeignKey` in Django when `_order` is included in an `Index`. The issue is that the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation fails because the `_order` field has not been created yet when `AddIndex` is executed. This indicates a logical ordering issue in the migration operations.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, I identified key sections of the Django migration code that are relevant to this issue. The `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class is defined in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, and it extends `ModelOptionOperation`. This class handles the operation for ordering with respect to a field. The `AddIndex` class, also in the same file, is responsible for adding indexes to a model. The `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` is where the logic for generating migration operations resides. Specifically, the `generate_added_indexes` method and the `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to` method are relevant as they deal with the generation of `AddIndex` and `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operations, respectively.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the relevant code spans are those that define and handle these migration operations. The identified code spans include the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class, the `AddIndex` class, and the methods in `MigrationAutodetector` that generate these operations. These code spans are crucial for understanding how the operations are defined and how they are sequenced in the migration process.\n\nThus, to resolve the issue, one would need to ensure that the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation is executed before the `AddIndex` operation involving the `_order` field.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a critical sequence problem in Django migrations where the operation 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' fails when executed after the 'AddIndex' operation for the '_order' field. This issue arises because the '_order' field, which is implicitly created by 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo', does not exist when 'AddIndex' attempts to create an index on it. To address this, we need to ensure that 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' is executed before 'AddIndex'.\n\nThe search results provide key insights into how these operations are managed within Django's migration framework:\n\n1. 'MigrationAutodetector.add_operation': This method is responsible for adding operations to the migration plan. It provides the flexibility to either append or insert operations at the beginning of the list, which could potentially be leveraged to enforce the correct sequence of 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' before 'AddIndex'.\n\n2. 'MigrationAutodetector.generate_added_indexes': This method specifically handles the generation of 'AddIndex' operations. By examining its implementation, we can see how and when 'AddIndex' operations are planned.\n\n3. 'MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to': This method handles the planning of 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' operations. A critical observation here is the use of dependencies. When 'order_with_respect_to' is added, a dependency is created to ensure the operation is sequenced correctly relative to field additions. This implies that the system is designed to support such dependencies, but the correct implementation needs to be ensured.\n\nBased on these observations, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and possibly modifying the migration sequencing logic in Django to resolve the reported issue.",
