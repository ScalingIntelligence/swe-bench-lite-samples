The error arises because the '_order' field does not exist at the time AlterOrderWithRespectTo tries to add it if it follows the creation of an index involving '_order'. Thus, the order of these operations in the migration file needs to be adjusted to ensure '_order' exists before creating an index that includes it.\n\nFrom the file context and search results, it's clear that both AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations are defined in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file. The AlterOrderWithRespectTo class contains methods related to how the '_order' field gets added or removed based on the state. The AddIndex class, on the other hand, pertains to the creation of indexes on specified fields.\n\nThe relevance is confirmed in the 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' file within the MigrationAutodetector class, specifically in the 'generate_altered_order_with_respect_to' method. This method automatically detects changes regarding 'order_with_respect_to' and appropriately adds the operations to the migration. Understanding these methods is crucial for being able to adjust the migration script manually or via tooling to correct the operation ordering.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans cover the essential operations and methods involved in handling the 'order_with_respect_to' attribute and index creation, which directly relate to the reported issue. These spans should be sufficient for addressing the issue by either manually adjusting or providing insight into the automatic adjustment of migration script orders.",

The issue suggests that the '_order' field is not yet created when the AddIndex operation for '_order' is executed, leading to the crash. To resolve this, it's crucial to ensure that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before AddIndex for '_order'. The search results reveal the relevant sections of code where AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations are defined and processed. In particular, the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file contains the implementation of AlterOrderWithRespectTo and its methods for state and database operations. The 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' file shows how the MigrationAutodetector class generates these operations and potentially orders them. Understanding these implementations will help identify where the ordering of these operations needs to be adjusted to prevent the reported issue.",
