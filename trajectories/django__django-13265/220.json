Specifically, the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation is encountering an error because it is attempting to operate on the '_order' field before it has been created by the AddIndex operation. To address this issue, we need to search for files and code segments related to the AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations, as well as how migration operations are ordered and executed. We should focus on the django/db/migrations directory, as well as the specific files that define these operations and the logic that controls their execution order. Additionally, we should look for any related logic in the files that handle the creation and management of indexes and fields.",

Additionally, the 'django/db/models/base.py' file contains model-related operations that could affect the order handling '_order' field.
