Specifically, AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations are causing a conflict because the '_order' field, which needs to be included in an index, hasn't been fully created or processed by the time the index addition operation is executed. To resolve this, we need to identify the exact sequence of operations in the migration process and ensure that field-related operations are completed before subsequent indexing operations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a migration operation that adds an index to a '_order' field, which is subsequently used in an 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' operation. This error occurs because the '_order' field does not exist yet when the 'AddIndex' operation is executed. The issue suggests that 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' must be performed before 'AddIndex' to avoid this error.\n\nReviewing the search results, we find relevant code spans in two files: 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' and 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py'. The 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' operation, which is directly related to the issue, is found in the former file. Within this file, there are several code spans to help understand the functionality of 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo', including initialization, state transitions during migrations, and even the inverse operation for backwards compatibility.\n\nIn 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py', methods related to creating and removing indexes are located. This context is vital because it indicates where in the migration process indexes are handled, which directly influences the process of managing the '_order' field. Also included here is a method detailing how alterations to the 'order_with_respect_to' property are created, providing a clear link to 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' from 'models.py'.\n\nBased on the analysis, these code spans are identified as relevant to understanding and possibly resolving the reported issue.",
