Specifically, the 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' operation appears to require the '_order' field to be available before any indexes involving '_order' are created. This suggests a need to reorder the operations in the migration or possibly adjust how the '_order' field is handled in relation to the indexes. Since 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' and 'AddIndex' are central to this issue, priority should be given to understanding how they interact and how their execution order is determined.",

The issue arises when using `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` after `AddIndex` of the `_order` field, causing a crash because the `_order` field hasn't been created yet. The ideal order of operations should be to first perform `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` to create the `_order` field before adding any indexes that include `_order`. In the search results, we have found relevant code spans that define the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations, which are crucial for understanding the issue and possible solutions. These operations are defined in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. Additionally, the 'django/db/models/base.py' file contains the `Model` class which is essential for understanding how the `_order` field is managed and accessed within Django models. The 'django/db/models/indexes.py' file defines the `Index` class, which is utilized in the `AddIndex` operation, further solidifying the understanding of how indexes are managed in Django models. Lastly, the 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' file contains the `SQLCompiler` class, which deals with SQL generation and ordering, providing insights into how Django handles SQL queries and ordering operations. These code spans collectively offer a comprehensive view of the issue at hand and the mechanisms behind the operations involved in the reported issue.",
