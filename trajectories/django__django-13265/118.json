The problem arises because the field `_order` is not yet available at the time an index including it is attempted to be created. This indicates the need to investigate how Django's migration operations handle sequence execution, particularly focusing on how `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations are managed and sequenced. The relevant files seem to be those handling model operations and state changes during migrations, particularly where the logic of these operations and their dependencies are defined and executed.",

This is because the `_order` field hasn't been created yet when the `AddIndex` operation is attempted. To resolve this, the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation needs to be performed before the `AddIndex` operation.\n\nThe provided search results include several relevant code spans from the `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` and the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` classes in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. These sections of code are responsible for handling the order of operations and the specific operations themselves, respectively.\n\nFrom `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, the following code spans are relevant:\n- `MigrationAutodetector._resolve_dependency` and `MigrationAutodetector.check_dependency` for resolving dependencies and checking if dependencies are satisfied.\n- `MigrationAutodetector.add_operation` for adding operations to the migration.\n- `MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to` for generating the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation.\n\nFrom `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, the following code spans are relevant:\n- `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` for the class defining the operation.\n- `AddIndex` for the class defining the operation.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they deal directly with the operations that need to be ordered correctly to avoid the crash reported in the issue.

It is evident that `AddOperation` and `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to` methods are responsible for managing the order and dependencies of migration operations, which is critical in resolving the current issue. Additionally, the `models.py` file within `migrations/operations` enfolds the definitions of specific operations like `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex`, but the current context does not fully reveal the dependencies each operation has on other operations, including each other. The next steps involve a deeper look into how the sequence of these operations is determined and what dependencies exist that could order the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation to be handled before `AddIndex` concerning the `_order` field.

The current context includes relevant files and spans, but it lacks the specific implementations for `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` that interact with the `_order` field. The new search results provide this missing context, specifically in the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class definition and its methods (`deconstruct`, `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, `database_backwards`, `references_field`, `describe`, and `migration_name_fragment`) and also in the `AddIndex` class definition, focusing on the `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, `deconstruct`, and `migration_name_fragment` methods. These spans reveal how the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation modifies the state related to ordering and how indexes are managed with `AddIndex`. This information directly addresses the issue by showing the necessary code to understand and potentially resolve the conflict between these operations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified in the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file, specifically the spans related to `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations.",

The `check_dependency` method in MigrationAutodetector also contains logic to manage how dependencies among operations are verified, and this must be checked to ensure the correct sequence for preventing the error.
