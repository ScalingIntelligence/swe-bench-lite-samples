The error arises because the '_order' field is not yet created when the AddIndex operation tries to include it in an index. This suggests that the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation should precede the AddIndex operation. To address this, we need to identify the part of the code responsible for ordering these operations in the migration process. The relevant classes and methods to check include AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py, as well as methods responsible for sorting and adding operations in django/db/migrations/autodetector.py.",

The problem arises because the AddIndex operation for '_order' is executed after the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation, leading to a failure since '_order' does not exist at the time AlterOrderWithRespectTo attempts to use it. To address this, the relevant code spans from the search results should focus on the implementation of AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations. Specifically, examining how these operations are defined and handled in the migration process is crucial. The search results include detailed code spans for both AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex, from their initialization, state management, to database operations. These spans provide a comprehensive understanding of how each operation interacts with the database and model states, which is essential for diagnosing and fixing the issue at hand. The key steps involve ensuring that the '_order' field is properly managed and its presence validated before any operation that depends on it. This ensures that AlterOrderWithRespectTo can safely execute before AddIndex, avoiding the error of referencing a non-existent field. The identified code spans cover all relevant aspects of these operations, making it clear that they are relevant to the reported issue.",

The error occurs because `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is executed after `AddIndex`, leading to a situation where `_order` field has not been created yet when the index is attempted to be added. The relevant code spans from the search results and the context provided focus on the implementation of `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations. Both operations are involved in the migration process, and their order of execution is crucial. The `database_forwards` method in `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and the `database_forwards` method in `AddIndex` are especially relevant as they define what actions are taken when applying the migration forward. The issue suggests that the sequence of operations in the migration file needs to be adjusted so that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is executed before `AddIndex` to avoid the crash. Additionally, the `MigrationAutodetector` class from `autodetector.py` is examined for its role in sorting and managing migration operations, which could influence the order of operations when generating migrations automatically.",
