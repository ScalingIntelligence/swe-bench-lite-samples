These sections include the constructor and methods that define the behavior of AlterOrderWithRespectTo, such as `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, and `database_backwards`, which are crucial for understanding how the `_order` field is managed and how dependencies might need to be adjusted to avoid the crash.
