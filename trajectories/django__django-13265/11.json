The search results show portions of the MigrationAutodetector class in django/db/migrations/autodetector.py, which is responsible for generating migration operations. The relevant code spans include methods that handle the addition of operations (add_operation), the generation of created models (generate_created_models), and the alteration of order with respect to (generate_altered_order_with_respect_to). These methods are crucial for understanding how migration operations are sequenced and interdependent. For instance, the generate_created_models method details how operations like AddIndex and AlterOrderWithRespectTo are added, which directly relates to the issue in question. The identified code spans provide insights into how the migration dependency graph is built and sorted (MigrationAutodetector._build_migration_list and _sort_migrations), which might be where the sequencing issue arises. Since the reported issue involves understanding and potentially modifying the sequencing of these operations within the Django migration framework, these code spans are highly relevant.",
