            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the order of operations in Django migrations when dealing with `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex`. The error occurs because the `_order` field, necessary for `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, is not yet created when `AddIndex` for `_order` is executed. The fix likely involves reordering these operations within the migration files, ensuring that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is processed before `AddIndex` for `_order`. From the provided context, we should concentrate on the operations and logic relevant to these operations within Django's migration framework. This involves looking at how operations like `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, `AddIndex`, and their sequencing are handled. Additionally, understanding how the `_order` field is managed and its presence ensured in the Django ORM and migration operations could be crucial.",

This issue arises because the `_order` field, which is created by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, is referenced in an `AddIndex` operation before it exists. This leads to errors during migration execution.\n\nFrom the provided search results, I have identified several relevant code spans that relate to the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation. These include the initialization of `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, the state forwards method, the database forwards method, and the references_field method. These spans cover the creation and handling of the `_order` field, which is crucial for understanding the issue.\n\nI have also identified relevant code spans for the `AddIndex` operation, which includes the initialization, state forwards method, and database forwards method. These spans are important because they show how indexes are added to the model, including the problematic `_order` field.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the operations involved in the reported issue.

The error described in the issue, where adding an index to the '_order' field after attempting 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' fails because the '_order' field has not been created yet, is directly addressed in this context. Specifically, the 'database_forwards' method in 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' ensures that the '_order' field is added before any operations relying on it, such as adding an index. This suggests that the logic to handle the sequence of operations is present in the context provided, making it plausible that the designer of this framework considered and resolved similar issues. However, the actual migration file provided in the issue context should be reviewed to ensure the operations are ordered correctly in practice, but from the perspective of the framework's classes and methods, the relevant code does appear to be present.",
