The error occurs because '_order' field referenced in AddIndex has not been created yet when AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed. This suggests that the migration operations need to be reordered to ensure '_order' field is created before it is referenced in an index. To address this, I'll search for the relevant code in Django's migration operations and schema editing modules.",
