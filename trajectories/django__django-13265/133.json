When 'order_with_respect_to' is set in a model's Meta class and an index is added involving the '_order' field, the migration can fail because '_order' might not exist at the time the index is added. The provided search results include relevant code spans for solving this issue. First, I analyzed the code spans related to AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex to understand their functionality, initialization, and execution. I found that the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation handles the order_with_respect_to option and manages the '_order' field, while the AddIndex operation adds indexes to the database schema. The error occurs because AlterOrderWithRespectTo might run after AddIndex when it should run before to ensure the '_order' field exists when the index is created. To resolve this, the operations need to be reordered, ensuring that AlterOrderWithRespectTo runs before any AddIndex operation involving '_order'. Given the steps provided in the search results, I identified the appropriate code spans that can potentially help resolve the issue by modifying the sequence of operations in the migration file. The identified spans are from the 'database_forwards', 'database_backwards', and 'references_field' methods of the AlterOrderWithRespectTo class, along with the '__init__' method of the AddIndex class. I believe these code spans provide the necessary context to address the issue and hence mark the search task as complete.",
