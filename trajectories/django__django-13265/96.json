Specifically, the error occurs because the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation is attempting to reference the '_order' field before it has been created by the preceding AddIndex operation. This suggests a need to investigate and potentially reorder these operations within the migration files. The relevant code spans are likely located in the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, and possibly other related migration files. Additionally, examining how AddIndex and AlterOrderWithRespectTo are handled in the `django/db/migrations/state.py` and `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` could provide more insights to resolve the issue.",
