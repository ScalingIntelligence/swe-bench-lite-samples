The error occurs because the `_order` field, required by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, is not yet created when `AddIndex` is processed.

Focusing on the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file and the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` classes within it can help identify how these operations should be sequenced.",
