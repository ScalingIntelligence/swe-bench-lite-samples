The problem is that the '_order' field is not created before the AddIndex operation, causing the AlterOrderWithRespectTo to fail. To address this, we need to identify where in the Django migration code the order_with_respect_to and AddIndex operations are handled and ensure that the '_order' field is appropriately handled. We should look into the models, migrations, and schema editor files to find the relevant code.",

And a new migration file based on the model looks like the code above.\nThe problem is operation AlterOrderWithRespectTo after AddIndex of '_order' raising error because '_order' field had not been created yet.\nIt seems to be AlterOrderWithRespectTo has to proceed before AddIndex of '_order'.\n"
