The analysis of the provided search results yields relevant code spans that can help understand and potentially resolve the problem. The relevant spans are found in the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file, particularly the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` classes, which encapsulate the logic for handling these specific operations. By examining these classes, one can see the method definitions for state_forwards, database_forwards, and other related methods that outline the behavior of these operations during the migration process. The 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' class shows how the '_order' field is added or removed based on the presence of the 'order_with_respect_to' option in the model's Meta class. The 'AddIndex' class illustrates how an index is added to a model's fields, including potential references to the '_order' field. Understanding these operations' internal logic is crucial for diagnosing why the migration process fails when '_order' is included in an index after 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' is applied. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans have been identified, focusing on the sections that deal directly with the '_order' field and the order_with_respect_to property.",

The user's model class has order_with_respect_to set to 'look', and an index is defined for ['look', '_order']. The error arises when the migration process attempts AlterOrderWithRespectTo after AddIndex for '_order', as '_order' field hasn't been created yet. This suggests that AlterOrderWithRespectTo needs to precede AddIndex for '_order' in the migration sequence.\n\nFrom the file_context, the relevant operations are defined in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py, specifically the AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex classes. These classes handle the state and database forwards and backwards operations related to setting order_with_respect_to and adding indexes, respectively.\n\nNew search results confirm the definitions and functionalities of AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex classes in the same file, django/db/migrations/operations/models.py. AlterOrderWithRespectTo manages the addition or removal of the '_order' field based on the presence of order_with_respect_to in the model's metadata. AddIndex is responsible for adding an index to the model's fields as specified. These operations are critical to understanding the sequencing required to avoid the reported issue.\n\nIn the context of the reported issue, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of how AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations should interact to ensure that migrations do not fail due to the '_order' field not being present when needed. Adjusting the order_with_respect_to setting before creating an index involving '_order' is vital to resolve the reported issue. Therefore, ensuring that AlterOrderWithRespectTo precedes any AddIndex operation involving '_order' in migration scripts will prevent the crash.",

The problem arises when AddIndex for the '_order' field is executed before the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation, causing an error because the '_order' field hasn't been created yet. The issue suggests that AlterOrderWithRespectTo should precede AddIndex for the '_order' field.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are:\n1. The definition and methods of the AlterOrderWithRespectTo class in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py.\n2. The definition and methods of the AddIndex class, also in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py.\n\nThese code spans outline how the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation modifies the model state to include a new '_order' field based on the specified 'order_with_respect_to' field, and how the AddIndex operation adds an index to the specified fields, including potentially the '_order' field.\n\nGiven these spans, it's clear that the order of these operations in the migration file is critical. The current order in the migration file does not align with the requirements to avoid the error, as the AddIndex operation for the '_order' field should not precede the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation.\n\nThe solution to this issue is to ensure that the migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation is placed before the migrations.AddIndex operation for the '_order' field in the migration file. This adjustment will ensure that the '_order' field is created before attempting to add an index to it.",
