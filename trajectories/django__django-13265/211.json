To solve this, we need to ensure that the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation is executed before the `AddIndex` operation involving `_order`.

The issue suggests that AlterOrderWithRespectTo should be executed before AddIndex to avoid the '_order' field not being created yet. The search results, focusing on django/db/migrations/autodetector.py, provide crucial insights into how Django handles migrations and specifically how it addresses altering order with respect to and index operations. The relevant sections from the search results include: 1. MigrationAutodetector._detect_changes: This method sets up the environment for detecting changes, including operations like AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex. 2. MigrationAutodetector._sort_migrations: This method sorts migrations in a way that dependencies are respected. It uses topological sorting, which is essential for ensuring that operations like AlterOrderWithRespectTo do not precede the necessary field creations or modifications that AddIndex might depend on. 3. MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to: This method is directly responsible for generating operations related to order_with_respect_to, including dependencies that ensure field availability. Understanding and potentially modifying these sections will be critical for resolving the issue where '_order' is not yet created when AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed.",
