This conflict occurs because `_order` field hasn't been created yet when `AddIndex` is applied. The task is to identify relevant code spans that deal with these operations in Django's migration framework to understand how they interact. From the provided search results, I analyzed the sections dealing with `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations. The relevant code spans include the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class definition, its `__init__` method, the `AddIndex` class definition with its `__init__` method, and the `MigrationAutodetector` class where migration operations are generated and sorted. These sections provide insights into the implementation and order of migration operations, which is crucial for addressing the issue of applying `AddIndex` before `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`.",

The current state of affairs suggests that the '_order' field isn't yet created when the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation is attempted, leading to a crash. To resolve this, we need to scrutinize the methods in the migration autodetector that handle operation sorting and dependencies, specifically in django/db/migrations/autodetector.py. We should look for methods that control the sequence of operations either by explicit sorting or by handling dependencies. We should perhaps focus on the _sort_migrations method and add_operation method within the MigrationAutodetector class. Additionally, understanding how dependencies are resolved and operations are added can provide insights into potential reordering or dependency adjustments that could prevent the issue.",
