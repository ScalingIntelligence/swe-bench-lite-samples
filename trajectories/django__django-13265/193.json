            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a crash when using `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` with a `ForeignKey` in a Django model, specifically when the `_order` field is included in an index. The issue arises because the `_order` field, which is implicitly created by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, is referenced in an index before it is actually created. This leads to a migration error.\n\nTo address this, it's crucial to understand the sequence of operations in Django migrations and how they interact with model fields and indexes. The provided search results from `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` contain relevant code spans related to `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations. These spans include the constructors, state forwarding methods, and database operations for both operations. By examining these spans, we can see how `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` interacts with the `_order` field and how `AddIndex` handles the creation of indexes.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the identified code spans are relevant because they directly pertain to the operations that are causing the error. Specifically, the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class's `database_forwards` method shows how the `_order` field is added to the model, and the `AddIndex` class's `database_forwards` method demonstrates how indexes are added to the model. These spans are essential for understanding the root cause of the issue and for developing a solution that ensures the `_order` field is created before any indexes that reference it.",
