The issue highlights a problem with the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation when an index involving '_order' is added. The error occurs because '_order' field has not been created yet. The issue suggests that AlterOrderWithRespectTo should proceed before adding the index for '_order'. I reviewed the search results to identify relevant sections. In the first file (django/db/migrations/operations/models.py), I found the definition of AlterOrderWithRespectTo, which includes its methods such as __init__, deconstruct, state_forwards, database_forwards, database_backwards, references_field, describe, and migration_name_fragment. This class is critical as it defines how the order_with_respect_to operation is handled. The other spans in this file define other migration operations like CreateModel, which can help understand how migrations are structured in Django.\n\nIn the second file (django/db/migrations/autodetector.py), there are sections like generate_altered_order_with_respect_to and generate_created_models. These methods involve the auto-detection of changes in models for migrations, and understanding how order_with_respect_to is handled in these auto-detection processes is crucial.\n\nIn the third file (django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py), the imports section lists all the migration operations available in Django, which gives an overview of the different types of operations. Considering the reported issue, the relevant operations here are the ones related to model modifications, especially AlterOrderWithRespectTo.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue reported in the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation when combined with adding an index on '_order'.",
