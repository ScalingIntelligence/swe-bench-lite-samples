The specific issue is with the combination of order_with_respect_to and indexes which includes the '_order' field. The error occurs when running the migration operation AlterOrderWithRespectTo after AddIndex for the '_order' field, because '_order' has not been created yet. This issue requires examining the Django code related to AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations to understand their behavior and the order of operations they perform.\n\nThe provided search results contain relevant Django code snippets from django/db/migrations/operations/models.py and django/db/models/base.py. These files contain the definitions of AddIndex and AlterOrderWithRespectTo classes, which are critical for understanding the migration operations applied to the model. The relevant spans include implementations of database forwards and backwards methods for these operations, particularly the handling of _order fields.\n\nFrom the analysis of the search results, it is evident that the AddIndex operation involves adding an index to the model, while the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation handles the ordering with respect to a specified field, potentially including creating or removing the _order field. The sequence in which these operations are applied in the migration file seems to be critical to avoid the described error, as AddIndex must not be applied before the _order field exists, as handled by AlterOrderWithRespectTo.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans in the search results are relevant to the reported issue, as they provide direct insights into how Django's migration operations interact with the ordering and indexing of fields. Therefore, the task of identifying relevant code spans can be considered complete.",

The current context shows that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` involves altering the model's state and updating the database schema to respect the ordering provided, while `AddIndex` modifies the database schema by adding indexes to specific fields. The potential conflict arises from the sequence in which these operations are executed, specifically when the index on `_order` is added before the field itself is fully initialized by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`. Since managing dependencies and order of operations is crucial, further insights can be obtained by exploring Django's internal mechanisms for handling migration order, dependency resolution, and error handling during migration operations. Additionally, analyzing successful migration scenarios where `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` work in harmony can provide best practices or patterns to follow.",

The code provided in the issue and the search results indicates a potential problem where the `_order` field is not yet created when the `AddIndex` operation is executed, causing a crash. To address this, we need to ensure that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is executed before `AddIndex` in the migration sequence. The relevant code spans in the search results include the definition of `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations, which are pivotal in understanding how these operations manipulate the database schema. Additionally, the `MigrationAutodetector` class provides insights into the dependency resolution and migration generation logic, which could influence the order of operations in the migration sequence.

The `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class in the same file illustrates how the model's state is updated with respect to ordering and how the schema is modified to reflect these changes. Given the nature of the issue, where the order of operations matters (the index on `_order` should be added after `_order` is initialized by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`), it's evident that the relevant code for these operations is indeed present in the file context.
