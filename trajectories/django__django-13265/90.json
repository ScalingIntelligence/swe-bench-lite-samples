The error occurs because the AddIndex operation tries to index a field that hasn't been created yet by the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation. To resolve this, we need to ensure that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before AddIndex for '_order'. We should focus our search on the migrations framework and model operations related to these features.",

This indicates a need to understand the operations and how they interact. The search results have relevant spans: AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex. These spans show the internals of how these operations are defined and implemented in Django's migration framework. Specifically, the AlterOrderWithRespectTo class defines how order_with_respect_to is added or removed from a model, while the AddIndex class defines how an index is added to a model. These operations are critical for understanding and potentially fixing the issue reported, as they show the sequence and dependencies of database operations.

There isn't explicit documentation in this context on the order of execution between these two operations. However, based on the Django migrations framework's principles, operations are generally executed in the order they are defined in the migration file. The core issue described indicates that the '_order' field, which is managed by AlterOrderWithRespectTo, must exist before AddIndex tries to create an index on it. Therefore, to ensure that AlterOrderWithRespectTo executes before AddIndex, we must look for documentation or functionality in Django that specifies how migrations are ordered or how they can be manually reordered. This search should focus on the broader Django migrations framework, focusing on aspects that deal with migration execution order and dependencies.",

This issue occurs because the '_order' field has not been created yet when the AddIndex operation is executed. To address this, it's essential to understand the order of operations in the migration process and how AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex interact.\n\nBased on the provided file context and search results, the relevant code spans involve the implementation of AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations. The analysis of these spans shows how the operations are defined, initialized, and executed, including the database transformations they perform.\n\nThe `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` class sets the 'order_with_respect_to' option and handles the addition and removal of the '_order' field. The `AddIndex` class adds an index to the specified fields of a model. The issue arises because the 'AddIndex' operation is executed before the '_order' field is created by the 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' operation. This indicates a need to adjust the order of operations within the migration file to ensure the '_order' field is created before any index that references it.\n\nThe search results from 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' also provide insights into how the migration operations are detected and applied. The 'generate_altered_order_with_respect_to' method specifically addresses changes in the 'order_with_respect_to' option and ensures the proper dependencies are set. This further supports the need to ensure 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo' is executed before any operations that depend on the '_order' field being present.",

The error occurs because the '_order' field is not yet created when the AddIndex operation is executed, suggesting the AlterOrderWithRespectTo should precede the AddIndex operation. This aligns with the need to ensure the field exists before creating an index on it. The relevant sections of code are primarily in the django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file, specifically the AlterOrderWithRespectTo class which handles operations related to ordering with respect to a particular field. Additionally, the AddIndex class in the same file is relevant as it directly deals with adding indexes to models, which is the operation causing the issue due to the timing of when the '_order' field is created. Furthermore, the MigrationAutodetector class in django/db/migrations/autodetector.py is also pertinent as it generates migration operations and thus plays a role in how these operations might be ordered and executed.",
