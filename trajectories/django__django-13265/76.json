Specifically, the error occurs because the '_order' field, which is crucial for AlterOrderWithRespectTo, is not yet created when the AddIndex operation attempts to reference it. To resolve this, we need to identify how Django handles the sequence of these operations and determine if there's a way to control their order. The relevant files to investigate would be those related to migration operations (like models.py and autodetector.py) and schema editing (like schema.py), focusing particularly on the definitions and interactions of AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex.",

The issue suggests that the '_order' field is not created yet when AddIndex operation for '_order' is executed, leading to a crash. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the creation and alteration of the '_order' field and the indices. The search results provide several relevant spans from django/db/migrations/operations/models.py and django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py. These include spans for AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex, which are directly related to the reported issue. Specifically, the spans for AlterOrderWithRespectTo.__init__, AlterOrderWithRespectTo.database_forwards, AlterOrderWithRespectTo.database_backwards, AddIndex.__init__, AddIndex.database_forwards, and AddIndex.database_backwards are particularly relevant as they deal with the logic for altering the model's ordering and adding indices to the model.

The current file context already highlights relevant code spans for AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations, which are crucial for understanding how these operations function.\n\nIn the new search results, the sections for AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex are repeated, providing a more detailed view of these operations. Notably, the state_forwards method for both operations describes how they affect the model state, which is important for understanding the impact on the migration order.\n\nThe problem mentioned in the issue would likely be addressed by ensuring that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before any AddIndex operation that includes '_order'. This suggests that the migration operations need to be reordered to accommodate the creation of the '_order' field before it is indexed.\n\nThe relevant code spans from the search results include:\n- The __init__ and deconstruct methods for both AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex, which define how these operations are initialized and serialized.\n- The state_forwards method for both operations, which updates the state of the model during the migration.\n- The database_forwards and database_backwards methods for both operations, which implement the actual schema changes on the database.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they directly deal with the logic and sequencing of model changes during migrations, which is at the core of the issue reported.",

From the provided file context and search results, we can identify relevant code spans that handle these operations:\n1. The AlterOrderWithRespectTo class and its methods (including __init__, deconstruct, state_forwards, and database_forwards) in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py.\n2. The AddIndex class and its methods (including __init__, state_forwards, and database_forwards) in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py.\nThese classes and methods are crucial for understanding how the AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations are implemented and how they interact with the database and model state.

These operations, especially AlterOrderWithRespectTo, involve handling the '_order' field introduced for ordering models with respect to a foreign key. The inclusion of specific methods such as state_forwards, database_forwards, and database_backwards, which define how these operations are applied and reversed, is indicative of a comprehensive approach to managing migration-related changes. Given the framework's handling of dependency management and field existence checks before operations proceed, the file context appears thorough in detailing how the migration operations should be executed without causing the described crash related to '_order' field existence. Thus, based on the available file context, everything necessary seems to be provided to understand and troubleshoot the reported issue regarding AlterOrderWithRespectTo.",
