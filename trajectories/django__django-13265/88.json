The problem arises because AlterOrderWithRespectTo is attempting to modify the order with respect to a field ('_order') that hasn't been created yet due to the AddIndex operation for that field coming after it in the migration file. This discrepancy is crucial because it highlights a logical error in the migration sequence where the '_order' field is referenced before its existence is ensured by the AddIndex operation. The provided search results contain significant code spans related to both AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations in Django's migration framework. These spans detail the initialization, state transformation, and database manipulation methods for both operations, which are directly relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue. By analyzing these spans, one can see how the operations interact with the database and model states, offering insights into how to adjust the migration order to prevent the error.",
