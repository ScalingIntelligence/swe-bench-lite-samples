The error occurs because '_order' field is not yet created when the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation is executed. To resolve this, we need to find where in the Django migration code the operations are being generated, sorted, and applied. It's important to identify how migrations are processed and their dependencies are handled. The relevant files and functions seem to be in the django/db/migrations directory and specifically within operations, autodetector, schema editors, and state management files.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a crash when using `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` with a `ForeignKey` when an index includes the `_order` field. This suggests a specific sequence of operations in the migration process is causing the issue. The issue specifically notes that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` should proceed before `AddIndex` for the `_order` field to avoid errors. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle these operations in Django's migration framework.\n\nThe search results provided include several key classes and methods related to model operations and migrations: `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, `AddIndex`, and other related operations like `AlterModelManagers` and `AddConstraint`. These classes and methods are found in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`.\n\n`AlterOrderWithRespectTo`: This class is responsible for managing the ordering of objects with respect to a given field. It includes methods for altering the state (`state_forwards`), executing database operations (`database_forwards` and `database_backwards`), and handling field references (`references_field`).\n\n`AddIndex`: This class handles the addition of indexes to models. It includes methods for altering the state (`state_forwards`), executing database operations (`database_forwards` and `database_backwards`), and describing the operation (`describe`).\n\nGiven the issue, the key spans to focus on are those related to the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` classes. Specifically, the methods `AlterOrderWithRespectTo.state_forwards`, `AddIndex.state_forwards`, `AlterOrderWithRespectTo.database_forwards`, and `AddIndex.database_forwards` are critical for understanding how the operations affect the model state and the database schema. These methods should be reviewed to ensure that the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation is correctly applied before the `AddIndex` operation involving the `_order` field.",

To resolve this, we need to ensure that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before AddIndex for the '_order' field.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, we find relevant code spans in the django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file that define the behavior of both AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex. The relevant spans include the database_forwards method for both AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex, which handle the actual application of these operations to the database.\n\nGiven the issue, the identified code spans provide the necessary context to understand how the operations work and interact, but they do not directly address the issue of ordering. Therefore, it is important to ensure that migrations are created in the correct order to avoid this problem. The reported issue suggests that this ordering problem is already understood, and the task involves identifying the relevant code to support the understanding of the problem and potential solutions.",

The `AddIndex` operation, on the other hand, is used to specifically add an index to the database based on an `Index` object instance, which includes fields such as `look` and `_order`. The problem described in the issue arises because the `_order` field is expected to exist before the `AddIndex` operation, which may not always be guaranteed based on how these operations are sorted and executed.

The provided search results include several code spans related to the operations involved: AlterOrderWithRespectTo, AddIndex, and other migration operations.
