Specifically, the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation fails after the `AddIndex` operation for the '_order' field because '_order' hasn't been created yet. To resolve this, we need to identify where the order with respect to and the indexing operations are defined and executed. This involves looking into the ModelOperation, AlterOrderWithRespectTo, AlterModelManagers, AddIndex, AddConstraint classes and their methods in the Django migrations module. Additionally, we should check the MigrationAutodetector for how it sorts and adds operations.",

The error occurs because the '_order' field, which is managed by AlterOrderWithRespectTo, is included in an index added by AddIndex before it has been created. This results in a crash. To address this, it is crucial to ensure that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before any operations that involve the '_order' field, including the AddIndex operation. The provided search results contain relevant code spans from django/db/migrations/operations/models.py that define the behavior of AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex. These code spans include the initialization, state forwards, and database forwards methods for both operations, which are critical for understanding how and when these operations modify the database schema and state. Specifically, the 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo.database_forwards' span shows how the '_order' field is added to the model, and 'AddIndex.database_forwards' shows how indices are added to the model. By analyzing these spans, it can be concluded that to fix the issue, the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation should precede the AddIndex operation involving the '_order' field.",
