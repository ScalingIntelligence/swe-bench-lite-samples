The search results provide detailed methods for each operation, including state_forwards and database_forwards, which are crucial for understanding how state and database changes are applied. The identified code spans include the initializers, state_forwards, and database_forwards methods for both AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations, which are directly relevant to the reported issue.
