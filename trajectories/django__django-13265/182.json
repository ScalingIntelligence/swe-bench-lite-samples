This necessitates examining how Django handles AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex operations during migrations. From the search results, the relevant spans are those that define and describe the behavior of AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex. The spans 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo.__init__', 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo.database_forwards', and 'AddIndex.__init__' are particularly important as they outline how these operations are initialized and applied in the database. Furthermore, understanding whether the '_order' field is created before or after the index addition is critical. Therefore, the code spans detailing the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation are essential, particularly where relations to fields like '_order' are addressed, such as 'AlterOrderWithRespectTo.database_forwards'. The AddIndex spans are also relevant for understanding how indexes are managed and possibly how the '_order' field interacts with these processes. This information helps in diagnosing the sequence problem between altering order with respect to a field and adding an index on it. These spans provide the necessary context to correlate the reported issue with the actual migration operations in Django's codebase.",
