The error suggests that the '_order' field is not created when the AddIndex operation is executed. To resolve this, it's necessary to ensure that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before AddIndex for the '_order' field. This requires examining the relevant Django migration operations and their order of execution.",

This is because the '_order' field has not been created yet when the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation is attempted. The task is to identify code spans that are relevant to this issue, focusing on where migrations operations are defined and processed. After reviewing the search results, I identified a few key areas within the Django migration framework that are directly relevant or could potentially impact the issue: 1. The `django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py` file where various migration operations, including AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex, are imported and included in the `__all__` list. This consolidates operations for use within migrations and shows their declarations. 2. The `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, particularly the OperationWriter class. This class is responsible for serializing migration operations, which involves writing out their component parts such as arguments and dependencies. These serialized operations are crucial for understanding how dependencies between operations like AddIndex and AlterOrderWithRespectTo are coded and managed. 3. The `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` file contains the MigrationAutodetector class. This class auto-detects changes and generates migration operations. Relevant methods here are related to adding operations, resolving dependencies, and optimizing migrations, showing the logic the framework uses for operation ordering and integration. 4. The `django/db/migrations/migration.py` file defines the Migration class. This class represents individual migrations and includes fields for operations and dependencies, relevant for how individual migrations are constructed and how they reference other migrations. 5. The `django/db/migrations/loader.py` file shows how migrations are loaded and dependencies are recorded. Given the issue's nature, these files and parts of them are highly relevant because they impact how migrations, particularly those involving AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex, are created, ordered, and executed. These points are crucial in addressing the reported issue of ensuring that the AddIndex is not attempted before the field '_order' is created, which will not only prevent crashes but also streamline migration dependency management.",
