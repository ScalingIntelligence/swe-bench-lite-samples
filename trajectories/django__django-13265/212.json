The issue arises because the '_order' field is not yet created when the AddIndex operation is invoked, leading to a crash. To address this, it is crucial to understand the relevant code spans where these operations are defined in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py and django/db/models/base.py. The search results contain the definitions of the AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex classes, along with key methods that handle the state and database operations for these migrations. These code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue because they directly involve the operations and mechanisms that could lead to the error condition described.",

The current file context and search results contain relevant operations and methods that interact with `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex`. The analysis involves examining how these operations affect the state and database schema, specifically focusing on the order of operations and dependencies between them. The issue indicates that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` must precede `AddIndex` for `_order`, suggesting a potential flaw in the migration order or dependencies. The search results include classes like `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, `AddIndex`, and `MigrationAutodetector` that handle these operations and their state transitions. These classes and their methods (`state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, etc.) are crucial for understanding how the state of models is updated and how operations are applied to the database.
