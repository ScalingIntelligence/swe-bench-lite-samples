The spans related to AlterOrderWithRespectTo (__init__, state_forwards, database_forwards, and database_backwards) and AddIndex (__init__, state_forwards, database_forwards, and database_backwards) are likely relevant as they define the behavior of these operations and how they interact with the database and model state.
