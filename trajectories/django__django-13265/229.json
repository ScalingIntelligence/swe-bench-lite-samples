Specifically, the error arises because the `_order` field needs to be created before it can be indexed, but the current migration order is attempting to add the index before creating the `_order` field. To resolve this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code where the migration operations are defined and potentially modify the order in which these operations are performed or generated. This involves looking into the Django migration operations and the logic that sorts or generates these migrations.",
