Specifically, the error occurs because the '_order' field, which is expected by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, is not yet created at the time it is executed. This indicates a need for a different order in the migration operations or additional conditional handling. Therefore, the investigation should focus on understanding how migrations are sorted and executed, and how to manipulate their order if necessary.",

The error occurs because '_order' field is referenced in the AddIndex operation before it is actually created by the AlterOrderWithRespectTo operation. To address this, we need to understand the implementation and sequence of these operations in the Django framework. The search results provide detailed code spans for the AlterOrderWithRespectTo and AddIndex classes, including their __init__, state_forwards, database_forwards, and other methods. These spans are crucial for understanding how these operations interact with the database and model states, and how they can be re-ordered or modified to prevent the error. Specifically, the database_forwards method in AlterOrderWithRespectTo involves adding the '_order' field, while the AddIndex operation references this field in the index. The solution likely involves ensuring that AlterOrderWithRespectTo is executed before AddIndex to ensure the '_order' field exists when referenced in the index. Reviewing the MigrationAutodetector class is also important as it handles the generation of migration operations and could potentially allow for a different sequence if properly configured.",
