The user also provided an example where `ccode` worked with a `Piecewise` function. Based on this, I looked for code in the `CCodePrinter` class and the `ccode` function to understand how `sinc` might be handled or if there's a need to extend support for `sinc` in C code generation. I also examined the `sinc` class and its methods in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` to understand its implementation and how it might interact with the C code printer. The relevant spans include the `CCodePrinter` class, its methods for handling `Piecewise` expressions, the `ccode` function, and the `sinc` class with its methods.",
