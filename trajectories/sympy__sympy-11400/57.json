The search results include several relevant files and spans, particularly in `sympy/printing/ccode.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`. In `ccode.py`, there are spans for `CCodePrinter` class methods that handle `Pow`, `Piecewise`, and `Symbol` printing, which are likely relevant to implementing support for `sinc`. The `sinc` class is found in `trigonometric.py`, and it has methods that handle differentiation, evaluation, and series expansion. The `sinc` class could likely be integrated into the `CCodePrinter` class to generate appropriate C code. The `known_functions` dictionary in `ccode.py` does not list `sinc`, which explains why `ccode(sinc(x))` fails. To resolve the issue, `sinc` should be added to `known_functions` and appropriate handling for `sinc` should be implemented in `CCodePrinter` methods.",
