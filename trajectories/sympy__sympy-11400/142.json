We should also examine the `sinc` function itself to understand its implementation and how it could be translated into C code. From the provided context and search results, we have identified relevant code spans in `sympy/printing/ccode.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`.

In `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, the `sinc` class and its methods are relevant, particularly `eval` and `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` which might be used to transform `sinc` into a form that can be printed as C code.

To fully resolve the issue, the `known_functions` dictionary in `CCodePrinter` would need to be updated to include `sinc`, and methods to handle its piecewise nature for C code generation would need to be implemented or extended.
