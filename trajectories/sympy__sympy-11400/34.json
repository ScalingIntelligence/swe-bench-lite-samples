The provided context shows that `sinc` is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` and it's likely that `ccode` should be able to handle this function since it has methods to handle pieces. To fix this, we should look at how `_print_Piecewise` in `sympy/printing/ccode.py` handles `Piecewise`, since `ccode` prints piecewise functions successfully, and potentially extend or modify it to include `sinc`. We also need to focus on the method `_print_not_supported` in `sympy/printing/codeprinter.py` to ensure that unsupported functions are handled gracefully. Finally, since `sinc` is rewritable as `sin`, we should also check `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` for any significant incompatibilities that might cause issues in `ccode`.",
