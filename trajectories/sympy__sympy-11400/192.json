The search results include the `CCodePrinter` class and its methods, which are responsible for C code generation. Notably, the `_print_Piecewise` method is relevant as it demonstrates how conditional expressions are handled in C code. This method could be the basis for implementing support for the `sinc` function, as it involves handling conditional expressions, which is similar to what would be needed for the `sinc` function (which has a conditional behavior at x=0). Additionally, the `ccode` function is found, which is the main entry point for generating C code from SymPy expressions.

It remains necessary to identify or implement how `_print_sinc` should be created or modified to incorporate the `sinc` function's specific behavior.

The `CCodePrinter` class in the provided `ccode.py` file is responsible for printing C code, and it contains methods for handling piecewise functions (`_print_Piecewise`). This method is relevant because the `sinc` function can be represented as a piecewise function.
