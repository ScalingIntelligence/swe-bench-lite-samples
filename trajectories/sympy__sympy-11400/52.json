The provided search results offer valuable insights into the relevant parts of the codebase, particularly in the `sympy.printing.ccode` and `sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric` modules. In the first file, `ccode.py`, the `CCodePrinter` class handles the translation of SymPy expressions into C code. Notably, the `_print_Piecewise` method formats piecewise expressions correctly, which is relevant as `sinc` could be represented using a piecewise function. In the second file, `trigonometric.py`, the `sinc` class definition and its methods reveal how the `sinc` function is evaluated and rewritten, potentially offering clues on how to support it in C code generation. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those involved in the `CCodePrinter` class for code generation and the `sinc` class for function evaluation.",
