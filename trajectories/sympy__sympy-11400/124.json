The user expects that it could handle a piecewise function for `sinc` function, which is composed of `sin(theta)/theta` for non-zero theta and 1 for zero theta. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that involve handling the `sinc` function and how it is translated to C code. The search results include files from `sympy/printing/ccode.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`. From `sympy/printing/ccode.py`, the `ccode` function and `CCodePrinter` class are relevant for generating C code. From `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, the `sinc` class and its methods are relevant for handling the `sinc` function. The methods `fdiff`, `eval`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_jn`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` within the `sinc` class provide the logic for evaluating and rewriting the `sinc` function. The `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` method specifically rewrites `sinc` in terms of `sin`, which is likely related to the expected behavior described in the issue. Additionally, considering the piecewise nature of the `sinc` function, other trigonometric functions like `sin` and `cos` are relevant to ensure the full context is considered. The task is complete as the relevant spans have been identified.",
