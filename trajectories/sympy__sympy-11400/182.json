The search results include the `sinc` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` and the `CCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/ccode.py`. The `sinc` class provides the mathematical definition and behavior of the `sinc` function, while the `CCodePrinter` class is responsible for converting SymPy expressions into C code. Notably, the `CCodePrinter._print_Piecewise` method is relevant because it handles the conversion of piecewise functions, which is likely how the `sinc` function would need to be handled to ensure proper C code generation. Specifically, the piecewise condition where `theta` is not zero (`Ne(theta, 0)`) would be critical for generating the conditional C code. Given these insights, the identified spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` (`sinc`, `sinc.eval`, `sinc.fdiff`) and `sympy/printing/ccode.py` (`CCodePrinter`, `CCodePrinter.__init__`, `CCodePrinter._print_Piecewise`) are relevant to the issue, as they encompass the function definition, evaluation logic, and the C code printer responsible for converting the `sinc` function into conditional C code.",
