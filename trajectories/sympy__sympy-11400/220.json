The relevant files to investigate are those related to the `ccode` function and the `sinc` function. Specifically, we should focus on `sympy/printing/ccode.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, as they contain the `CCodePrinter` class with various methods for printing different types of expressions, including `_print_Piecewise`, and the `sinc` class defined within the trigonometric functions module. Additionally, we should ensure that the `ccode` function can handle the `sinc` function appropriately.",
