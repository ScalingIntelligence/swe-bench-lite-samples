It seems likely that the problem could be in the `CCodePrinter` class or methods handling the `sinc` function or `Piecewise` expressions. To pinpoint the exact location, we should start by looking at the method handling `sinc` in `ccode.py` and the `_print_Piecewise` method since the example uses a `Piecewise` construct for the workaround. Additionally, examining the `sinc` class implementation in `trigonometric.py` might reveal if there are any missing translations or unhandled cases.",

This suggests that the `sinc` function is not recognized or supported in the C code printing module. The current file context shows that `sympy/printing/ccode.py` contains the `CCodePrinter` class which is responsible for defining how different SymPy expressions are printed as C code. However, the `known_functions` dictionary in `CCodePrinter` does not include `sinc`. The search results reaffirm this, showing the `CCodePrinter` class definition without any mention of `sinc`. To address this issue, the `known_functions` dictionary should be updated to include `sinc`, potentially mapping it to a corresponding C function or macro if available. The relevance of including `sinc` in `known_functions` is further supported by the provided example of `ccode(Piecewise((sin(theta)/theta, Ne(theta, 0)), (1, True)))`, which correctly generates C code for the piecewise expression. This indicates that issues with printing `sinc(x)` might purely relate to the missing entry in `known_functions`, not to deeper problems with the C code printing logic itself. The task is not complete as the necessary code change to support `sinc` in C code generation has not been implemented.",
