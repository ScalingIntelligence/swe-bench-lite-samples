The `ccode` function is responsible for converting SymPy expressions into C code, and the `sinc` function is an elementary trigonometric function that is not directly supported in C. The search results provide information about the `ccode` function and its printer class, `CCodePrinter`, as well as the `sinc` function and its attributes in the `sympy` library. Specifically, the `sinc` function's `eval` method and its `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` method are noteworthy as they handle the evaluation and rewriting of the `sinc` function. These are likely places where support for `sinc` in the C code generation could be added or modified. Additionally, understanding how the `Piecewise` function is handled in the `ccode` function could also be relevant for implementing support for the `sinc` function in a piecewise manner as suggested in the issue. Based on these considerations, the identified relevant code spans include the definition of the `ccode` function, the `CCodePrinter` class, the `sinc` function definition, and its various evaluation and rewrite methods.",

The user suggests that the `sinc` function could be represented using `sin(theta)/theta` for non-zero `theta` and 1 for `theta` being 0, similar to the provided `Piecewise` example. Existing code in the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file includes a `sinc` class definition and its evaluation method, which checks if the argument is zero or extracts a minus sign. Additionally, the `ccode` function in `sympy/printing/ccode.py` currently does not handle the `sinc` function. The provided search results showcase various aspects of the `CCodePrinter` class and its methods, but notably lack handling for the `sinc` function directly. The relevant spans for addressing the issue would include those discussing the printing of conditional statements (`_print_Piecewise`) and mathematical functions (`_print_Pow`, `_print_Rational`), which are pertinent for implementing or adjusting the `ccode` generation for `sinc`.",
