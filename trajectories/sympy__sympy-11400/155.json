The provided search results include relevant code spans from the ccode.py and trigonometric.py files.

In trigonometric.py, the sinc class is defined with various methods like fdiff, eval, and rewrites, which are essential for processing the sinc function.

The `CCodePrinter` class in the former appears to be where `ccode` functionality is implemented. Although `CCodePrinter` initializes with a `known_functions` attribute that can include custom functions via the 'user_functions' setting, and there's a `_print_Piecewise` method which hints at dealing with conditional logic like the reported issue's solution, I did not find a method specifically for printing `Function`, which probably implies that handling of functions may be inherited or defined elsewhere. On the other hand, the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file contains the `sinc` function definition, including its `eval` and `fdiff` methods which are pertinent. This suggests that while there is reference to where `sinc` could be practically defined or expanded to, the precise method to integrate `sinc` into the C code printer is not fully uncovered in the provided context; specifics of how to modify `CCodePrinter` or the base `CodePrinter` to support `sinc` natively might be located in inheriting classes or elsewhere.",
