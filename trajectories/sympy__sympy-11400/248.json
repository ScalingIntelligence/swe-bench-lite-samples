The user provided a workaround using `Piecewise` to handle the `sinc` function in C code. To address this, we need to find the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the C code printing, specifically focusing on the `CCodePrinter` class and the `ccode` function. The provided search results contain sections related to `CCodePrinter`, including its initialization, handling of piecewise expressions, and the `ccode` function itself. These sections are relevant because they deal directly with how SymPy translates expressions into C code. The `_print_Piecewise` method is particularly relevant because it handles the translation of `Piecewise` expressions, which is the workaround suggested by the user for implementing `sinc`. Therefore, these code spans are likely relevant to resolving the issue.",

The handling of `Piecewise` is present in the `_print_Piecewise` method, which constructs conditional statements in C based on the conditions specified in the `Piecewise` expression. This method checks if the last condition is `True` to ensure a default case is present. Given this, it's essential to either add a `_print_sinc` method in `ccode.py` or modify the handling of `sinc` to leverage the `Piecewise` functionality if `sinc` can be represented as a `Piecewise` expression in C. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `sinc` function's definition in `trigonometric.py` supports the necessary conversion to a format that can be handled by the C code printer.",
