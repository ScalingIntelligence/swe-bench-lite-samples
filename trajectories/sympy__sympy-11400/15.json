The error message indicates that `sinc` is not supported in C, suggesting that the converter lacks handling for this specific function. To resolve this, we need to investigate the `CCodePrinter` class in the `ccode.py` file and potentially other related files that might affect the conversion process. Given the context, focusing on the `CCodePrinter` class and its methods, particularly how it handles unsupported functions like `sinc`, is crucial. Additionally, exploring how `Piecewise` expressions are handled in this context could provide insights into a potential workaround or implementation for `sinc`. ",

Upon reviewing the search results, the most relevant file is `sympy/printing/ccode.py`, which contains the `CCodePrinter` class responsible for generating C code from SymPy expressions. The `CCodePrinter._print_Pow` method and its handling of special cases like `-1` and `0.5` are relevant to how mathematical functions are converted into C code. Also, the `CCodePrinter._print_ITE` method corresponds to `Piecewise` functionality which is indirectly related to the expected behavior in the reported issue. The class `sinc` is also found in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, but it does not directly handle the C-code printing. However, its method `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` might be useful for generating C-compatible code as it rewrites `sinc` in terms of `sin`, which is already supported by CCodePrinter. Therefore, the identified spans focus on the C code generation aspects that need to be adjusted or extended to handle the `sinc` function correctly.",

However, there is no direct method in `CCodePrinter` handling the `sinc` function, nor is there clear documentation on how unsupported functions are typically dealt with in this printer.

The focus now shifts to addressing the immediate issue by adding support for the `sinc` function within the `CCodePrinter`. Given that the `sinc` function can be rewritten as `sin(arg) / arg` based on its definition in the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file, this logic can be integrated into the C code printing process. This involves extending or modifying the `CCodePrinter` class in the `sympy/printing/ccode.py` file to recognize and correctly print the `sinc` function in C code. Specifically, we need to add 'sinc' to the `known_functions` dictionary or handle it in a special case through a method such as `_print_sinc` if necessary.",
