This suggests that the `sinc` function might not have specific handling in the CCodePrinter class, or there might be a broader issue with handling trigonometric functions conversions in C code. To address this, we should focus on the CCodePrinter class and its methods, particularly the methods responsible for handling trigonometric functions and generating C code, such as `_print_sinc`, `_print_TrigonometricFunction`, or `ccode` itself. Additionally, looking at the `sinc` class definition in the trigonometric module could provide insights on why it might not be supported.",
