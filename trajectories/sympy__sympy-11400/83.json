The `sinc` function is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, and the `ccode` function is implemented in `sympy/printing/ccode.py`. It's crucial to investigate how `ccode` handles the `sin` and `sinc` functions and potentially other trigonometric functions, as well as how it processes `Piecewise` expressions, which are used to handle the `sinc` function's behavior at 0. Additionally, the `Piecewise` expressions themselves should be examined in the context of C code generation.",

This suggests that there might be an issue with how `sinc` is being handled or printed by the `CCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/ccode.py`. The relevant portions of the code to investigate would be the methods within `CCodePrinter` that deal with printing special functions or handling piecewise expressions. Additionally, since the `sinc` function is not supported directly in C and there are examples of handling piecewise expressions, it's important to see how `_print_Piecewise` and the overall `ccode` function handle these cases. Similarly, in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, the `sinc` class and its methods (`fdiff`, `eval`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_jn`, `_eval_rewrite_as_sin`) would need to be reviewed to understand how `sinc` is defined and expanded to try to find where the error occurs in translation.",
