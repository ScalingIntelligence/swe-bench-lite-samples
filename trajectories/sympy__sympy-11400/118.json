To resolve this, we need to investigate how `ccode` handles unsupported functions and how these functions are identified. This will likely involve analyzing the `ccode` function and methods related to printing unsupported functions in the CodePrinter class. Additionally, since the issue mentions a piecewise function for `sinc`, we should also look into how `Piecewise` is printed in ccode.",

We need to check if the `sinc` function is handled correctly or if it is missing in the `known_functions` dictionary.\n\n2. **sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py**: This file defines the `sinc` class with methods like `fdiff`, `eval`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_sin`. These methods are important for understanding how the `sinc` function behaves and should be considered when implementing support for `sinc` in `ccode`.\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant spans are:\n- The `known_functions` dictionary in `ccode.py` which needs to be checked for the `sinc` function.\n- The `sinc` class definition and its methods in `trigonometric.py`, particularly the `eval` and `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` methods which would be useful for implementing or debugging support in `ccode`.",

The current output indicates that `sinc` is not supported and just prints the function name. The search results include parts of the code responsible for generating C code (`sympy/printing/ccode.py`) and the definition of the `sinc` function (`sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`). The relevant code spans to address the issue are the ones that handle the `Piecewise`, `Pow`, and `Symbol` functions in the C code generation, as well as the definition and evaluation of the `sinc` function.

However, the 'CCodePrinter' class does not currently recognize or handle the 'sinc' function, which is why it doesn't work. To fix the issue, the 'sinc' function should be added to the 'known_functions' dictionary in 'CCodePrinter' and a custom method should be implemented to handle the conversion of 'sinc' into valid C code, mimicking the behavior of the 'Piecewise' function when theta is not zero.

Additionally, the `sinc` function is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`. To address the issue, one would need to update the `known_functions` dictionary with 'sinc' and implement custom handling for it. Since the 'sinc' function can be rewritten as `sin(arg) / arg`, it should be straightforward to include this logic in the `CCodePrinter` class. The `_print_Piecewise` method already handles piecewise functions, so if 'sinc' can be represented as a piecewise function, it should align well with the existing logic.",
