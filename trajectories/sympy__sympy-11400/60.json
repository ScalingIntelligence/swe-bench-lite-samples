The `sinc` class in the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file implements the `sinc` function, which is the main focus of the issue. Specifically, the `sinc` class methods like `fdiff`, `eval`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_jn`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_sin` are relevant as they define the behavior of the `sinc` function.
