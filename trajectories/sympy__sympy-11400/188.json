The search results provide significant insights into how C code generation is handled, especially in 'sympy/printing/ccode.py', where the `ccode` function and `CCodePrinter` class are defined. However, the known_functions dictionary in 'sympy/printing/ccode.py' does not include 'sinc', suggesting it's not explicitly handled. The 'sinc' function is defined in 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' and has several methods that could be useful for generating C code, including 'fdiff', 'eval', '_eval_nseries', '_eval_rewrite_as_jn', and '_eval_rewrite_as_sin'. Given these code spans, it seems feasible to implement the required functionality by enhancing the C code printer to handle the 'sinc' function or by providing a suitable rewrite rule for 'sinc'.

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe issue reports that `ccode(sinc(x))` does not work as expected, returning '// Not supported in C:\n// sinc\nsinc(x)'. To address this, we need to identify the code spans in the CCodePrinter class that handle function mappings and ensure that 'sinc' is properly mapped to a C-compatible function or expression, if possible. Based on the search results, we can see that the file `sympy/printing/ccode.py` contains the definition of the `CCodePrinter` class, which is responsible for generating C code. We should focus on the part of the class that defines known functions and their mappings. Since 'sinc' is not a standard C function, we might need to add a custom mapping or handle it specially within the `CCodePrinter` class. The provided search results do not contain the part of the code where the function mappings are defined or modified, so we should not stop our search here. We need to find the specific part of the code where the mappings for known functions are implemented in the `CCodePrinter` class, or where we would add a new mapping for 'sinc'.",

Additionally, update the `_print_sinc` method to correctly format the piecewise sinc function output without using `_nsort`, which does not exist in the provided context. Instead, use Python's built-in string formatting.\n\nThe `indent_code` method is not present in the provided code, so its restoration is not possible. However, the `_print_sinc` method needs updating to avoid using `_nsort` and use Python's built-in string formatting instead. The modification should focus on lines where `_nsort` is used and replace it with appropriate string formatting.",
