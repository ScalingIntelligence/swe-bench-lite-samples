The provided example shows a more complex expression handled by `ccode` of a Piecewise function, suggesting that `ccode` should support the `sinc` function by printing it as a specific C expression, possibly involving `sin` and `cos`.\n\nIn the existing context, we have the implementation of `CCodePrinter` and its methods, including `__init__`, `_print_Symbol`, and the main `ccode` function. We also have the definition and evaluation methods of the `sinc` function in `sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric`.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to ensure that `ccode` properly handles `sinc`. This may involve updating the `known_functions` dictionary in `CCodePrinter` to include `sinc` and defining how it should be printed. The search results confirm that `CCodePrinter` has methods for initializing settings, printing symbols, and formatting code, which are relevant for supporting the `sinc` function.\n\nGiven the current context, updating `CCodePrinter` to support `sinc` by either defining its C representation or handling it as a special case is required.",
