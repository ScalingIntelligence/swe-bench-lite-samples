On the other hand, `trigonometric.py` defines the `sinc` function and its behavior in SymPy, but it doesn't address its compatibility with C code generation. To resolve this, we need to extend the functionality of `CCodePrinter` to support `sinc`.

Given this, I need to find the relevant sections in the codebase that deal with function handling and printing in the CCodePrinter class, as well as any specific implementations or evaluations of the sinc function in other modules. I will also look for any general patterns in handling unsupported functions or expressions in the code printer to determine if a similar approach can be applied to the sinc function. The search results include sections of the CCodePrinter and CodePrinter classes that may be relevant to the handling of functions and expressions in C code, which could be extended to include the sinc function. However, there is no direct implementation for the sinc function in the provided search results. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant to understanding the broader context and structure of how functions are printed in C code but do not directly solve the issue related to the sinc function.",

On the other hand, trigonometric.py defines the sinc function and its behavior in SymPy, but it doesn't address its compatibility with C code generation. To resolve this, we need to extend the functionality of CCodePrinter to support sinc.

The user wants the ccode function to handle the sinc function properly and suggests that since 'math.h' doesn't have 'sinc', it should generate C code that could potentially use a piecewise function to handle the 'sinc' function behavior around zero. From the file context, it's clear that the `CCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/ccode.py` is responsible for generating C code, and the `sinc` function is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` but currently lacks support in the C code printer. The new search results confirm the absence of `sinc` in the `known_functions` dictionary of the `CCodePrinter` class, indicating that this is the primary place to add support for printing the 'sinc' function in C code. Additionally, the results show the handling of the `Pow`, `Rational`, and other mathematical functions, illustrating how different functions are printed in C. This suggests that adding a similar method for `sinc` would be appropriate. Therefore, the relevant code spans are related to the method where functions are printed in C code within the `CCodePrinter` class.",
