The `known_functions` dictionary, which maps SymPy functions to their C equivalents, does not include `sinc`. Additionally, there is no specific method within `CCodePrinter` dedicated to handling the `sinc` function. The `_print_Function` method could potentially be extended to handle unknown functions, including `sinc`, but currently, it does not feature any expansion for functions it does not recognize. Furthermore, the `_print_Piecewise` method is capable of converting `Piecewise` expressions into C code, which could be utilized for implementing `sinc` as a piecewise function. Since `sinc(x)` can be defined piecewise\u2014as sin(x)/x when x is not zero and as 1 when x is zero\u2014it might be possible to integrate `sinc` by modelling it after the `Piecewise` handling. This approach involves recognizing the special nature of `sinc` in the `_print_Function` method and implementing its piecewise behavior accordingly. Given the structure and contents of `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, specifically the `sinc` class, it may be beneficial to create a method in `CCodePrinter` that handles `TrigonometricFunction` subclasses more generically, allowing for specialized behaviour for functions like `sinc`.",
