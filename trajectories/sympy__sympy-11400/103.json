The user expects it to be handled similar to the `Piecewise` function that correctly translates to C code.\n\n2. **Review Current Context**:\n   No relevant code has been identified yet, so the focus is on the new search results.\n\n3. **Process New Search Results**:\n   3.1. **sympy/printing/ccode.py**:\n       - There's a `CCodePrinter` class that handles the printing of SymPy expressions to C code.\n       - Looking into this class methods, there are methods to handle specific functions like `sin`, `cos`, etc., but none for `sinc`.\n   3.2. **sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py**:\n       - The `sinc` function is defined here with its methods, but implementation details about how this should be turned into C code are not available.\n   3.3. Identify Relevance:\n       - The method `_print_Piecewise` in `CCodePrinter` class is relevant because it shows how complex expressions like `Piecewise` are converted to their C equivalents. This is useful for understanding how `sinc` might be handled.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Since the `sinc` function is not currently supported in the `CCodePrinter`, exploring and using the method `_print_Piecewise` can be insightful for how to translate the `sinc` function expression, especially if it involves conditions.\n\nHence, I recommend focusing on:\n- `CCodePrinter._print_Piecewise` to handle complex conditional expressions.\n- The definition and methods of `sinc` in `trigonometric.py` to understand the function better.",
