From the file context, the relevant files seem to be within the `sympy/printing` and `sympy/functions` directories, as they contain definitions and handling for similar functions and the `ccode` function itself. It's important to find where the `ccode` function is defined and where it handles different mathematical functions to see if it can be extended to support the `sinc` function properly.",

The provided search results include relevant sections of the codebase from 'sympy.printing.ccode' and 'sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric'.\n\nIn 'sympy.printing.ccode', the 'ccode' function and the 'CCodePrinter' class are central to generating C code. The 'known_functions' dictionary in 'ccode.py' does not include 'sinc', which explains the output noting that 'sinc' is not supported. This indicates that the current implementation lacks support for 'sinc', which is consistent with the reported issue.\n\nIn 'sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric', the 'sinc' class, which represents the 'sinc' function, is defined. Notably, the 'sinc.eval' method handles specific cases like zero and infinity, and the '_eval_rewrite_as_sin' method provides a way to express 'sinc' in terms of 'sin'. These methods could be relevant for implementing or enhancing support for 'sinc' in the C code generation.\n\nTo address the reported issue, it is necessary to either add support for 'sinc' in the 'known_functions' dictionary of 'ccode.py' or implement a custom handler for 'sinc' within the 'CCodePrinter' class. Additionally, understanding how 'sinc' is evaluated and rewritten in terms of other functions can guide the implementation of new functionality.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans include the 'ccode' function, the 'known_functions' dictionary, and class definitions for 'CCodePrinter' from 'ccode.py', as well as the 'sinc' class from 'trigonometric.py'. These spans are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue.",
