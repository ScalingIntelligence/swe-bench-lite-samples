These files contain the definitions and implementations for `ccode` and `sinc` respectively. The goal is to understand how `sinc` is defined and printed in C code.\n\nFrom the `sympy/printing/ccode.py` file, the relevant spans include the `CCodePrinter` class and the `ccode` function. The `CCodePrinter` class defines how expressions are translated into C code, and the `ccode` function is the main entry point for converting a SymPy expression into C code.\n\nIn the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file, the relevant spans include the `sinc` class and its methods such as `fdiff`, `eval`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_rewrite_as_jn`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_sin`. These methods define the behavior of the `sinc` function in various contexts, which is crucial for understanding how `sinc` should be translated into C code.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, we can identify potential issues or missing implementations in converting `sinc` to C code and determine if the search task is complete based on the information available.",

The `sinc` function is defined in the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file and includes methods for differentiation and evaluation, but there is no direct interaction with the `ccode` function in the provided context. To fully address the issue, one would need to update the `ccode` function in `sympy/printing/ccode.py` to handle `sinc` appropriately, likely by adding a case for `sinc` to the `known_functions` dictionary or implementing a custom print method for it.
