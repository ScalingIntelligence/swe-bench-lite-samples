The search results include several relevant files (\"sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py\", \"sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py\", and \"sympy/simplify/fu.py\") with spans of code that likely deal with trigonometric simplification. These spans include functions like trigsimp_groebner, __trigsimp, exptrigsimp, and specific trigonometric functions like sin and cos. Further, the file \"sympy/simplify/fu.py\" contains functions like TR2i, TR10i that are specialized trigonometric simplification transformations. These functions within the sympy.simplify module are responsible for simplifying expressions including trigonometric functions, and thus these identified spans are likely relevant to the reported issue.\n\nTo identify the relevant code spans, the focus would be on those functions and spans that deal directly with trigonometric simplification logic in the SymPy library, which are crucial for correcting the reported issue.
