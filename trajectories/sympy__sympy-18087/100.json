            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the incorrect simplification of the expression cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2) as cos(x) + sin(x) in various versions of SymPy, including version 1.5. This problem occurs for general complex x, while it works correctly if x is real. To identify relevant code spans, I focused on the trigonometric functions (sin and cos) and their simplification methods within the SymPy codebase. I examined the 'eval', 'taylor_term', '_eval_rewrite_as_exp', '_eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', '_eval_rewrite_as_cos', '_eval_rewrite_as_csc', '_eval_rewrite_as_sec', and '_eval_expand_trig' methods for both sin and cos classes. Additionally, I looked into the 'trigsimp' function in 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' which is responsible for simplifying trigonometric expressions. Relevant spans include the 'trigsimp' function and the '_eval_rewrite_as_sqrt' method for cosine, as they are directly involved in simplifying trigonometric expressions and handling square roots of sine squared. These sections will help in understanding how expressions like cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2) are currently handled, and potentially guide the implementation of a fix. Given the complexity and the specific nature of the issue (incorrect simplification in complex cases), a deeper look into these methods is necessary. Furthermore, the context of the search results indicates that no previous relevant code has been identified, which emphasizes the need to explore these new findings for their relevance to the issue.",
