The expression `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is incorrectly simplified as `cos(x) + sin(x)` for general complex `x`, although it works correctly for real `x`. Given the context, the focus should be on the `trigsimp` function and related trigonometric classes and methods. The `trigsimp` function itself and the trigonometric classes (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.) are likely places to start searching for the issue. Specifically, the `_trigsimp` and `__trigsimp` functions within `trigsimp.py` are relevant, as are the `eval` and `_eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` methods in the trigonometric classes.",

Understanding its role might provide insights into other aspects of trigonometric simplification.\n\n2. __trigsimp function in sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py: This function is a crucial part of the trigonometric simplification process, as it identifies and applies specific patterns to simplify trigonometric expressions. The issue reported might be related to how it handles specific patterns, especially those involving complex inputs.\n\n3. cos and sin classes in sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py: These classes define the behavior of cosine and sine functions, including their evaluation and rewriting methods.

To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that are responsible for trigonometric simplification, particularly involving cos and sin functions. I will focus on analyzing the 'trigsimp_groebner' function and the '__trigsimp' function from the 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' file, as they contain logic for trigonometric simplification. Additionally, the 'eval' methods for the 'sin' and 'cos' classes in 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' will be examined, as they handle the evaluation of these functions and might be involved in the incorrect simplification. The new search results include the 'sin.eval', 'sin._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', 'cos.eval', and 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt' spans, which are relevant to the reported issue. These spans contain the logic for evaluating and rewriting the 'sin' and 'cos' functions in terms of other expressions, including sqrt, which is crucial for addressing the issue.
