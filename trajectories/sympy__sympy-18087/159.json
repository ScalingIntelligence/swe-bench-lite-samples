The issue specifics that this expression is simplified incorrectly as cos(x) + sin(x) for general complex x, but correctly for real x. The search results primarily focus on trigonometric simplification functions within the SymPy library, particularly in the files 'fu.py' and 'trigsimp.py'. Relevant code spans include functions handling transformations of trigonometric expressions like 'TR7', 'TR8', 'TR9', 'TR10i', 'TR11', 'TR14', 'TRpower', and the main simplification function 'fu' in 'fu.py'. Additionally, 'trigsimp' in 'trigsimp.py' is instrumental in handling the main trigonometric simplification. These functions and transformations are designed to simplify various trigonometric expressions, indicating potential locations that could be contributing to the oversimplification issue.\n\nTo address the issue, it is necessary to examine how the functions are implementing the simplification logic, particularly focusing on 'TR7' to 'TR14' in 'fu.py' where specific calculation methods are detailed. Specifically, the logic in these functions should handle complex x and determine whether correct conditions are being applied for sqrt(sin(x)**2) to not be incorrectly simplified to sin(x). Investigation should also include ensuring the 'trigsimp' function considers the completeness of expressions before applying simplifications.",

The functions TR7, TR8, TR9, TR10i, TR11, TR14, and TRpower in the `fu` module, along with the `trigsimp` function in `trigsimp.py`, are potentially relevant to the issue of incorrect simplification of `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` for complex `x`. Specifically, TR7 and TR8 deal with powers and products of trigonometric functions, TR9 and TR10i handle sums of trigonometric functions, and TR11 and TR14 focus on specific transformations that might affect how the expression in question is simplified. The `trigsimp` function in `trigsimp.py` applies these simplification strategies, suggesting that the provided file context is relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
