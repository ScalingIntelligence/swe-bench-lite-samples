The search results provide insights into the SymPy library's handling of trigonometric functions, particularly within the 'trigonometric.py', 'fu.py', and 'trigsimp.py' files. Relevant code spans include definitions of trigonometric functions like sin and cos, methods for rewriting these functions in various forms (_eval_rewrite_as_exp, _eval_rewrite_as_sqrt, etc.), and simplification strategies (like TR8, TR9, etc.). These functions and methods are critical for understanding how SymPy might be attempting to simplify such expressions. Considering the specific issue reported, one might suspect that the simplification logic within these methods could be causing the erroneous simplification. It's crucial to examine how the 'sqrt(sin(x)**2)' term is being handled in these simplification routines, specifically looking for places where assumptions about the argument 'x' might be leading to incorrect outcomes. Additionally, the 'trig_split' function in 'fu.py', which is part of the simplification toolkit, is also relevant as it handles some trigonometric combinations.",
