We need to find the relevant code spans that handle the simplification of trigonometric functions and the evaluation of expressions involving sin and cos. From the search results, the code spans in 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' especially focus on the 'sin' and 'cos' functions and their evaluation methods ('sin.eval' and 'cos.eval'). These sections evaluate the expressions based on the properties of the trigonometric functions, including handling of complex arguments, which might be directly related to the reported issue. Additionally, 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' contains the 'trigsimp' function that is responsible for simplifying trigonometric expressions, including potentially incorrect simplifications handled by the 'fu' (from sympy.simplify.fu) method invoked within 'trigsimp'. The sections 'sin', 'cos', and 'trigsimp' thus appear to be the most relevant for addressing the reported issue.",

The current context provided shows the `sin` and `cos` classes with their `eval` methods. The new search results include the `trigsimp` function and the `trigsimp_old` function. The `trigsimp` function delegates to different simplification methods based on the `method` parameter. The `trigsimp_old` function appears to handle the old method of simplification, which includes logic to separate variables and simplify trigonometric expressions.
