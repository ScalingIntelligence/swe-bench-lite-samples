The issue does not occur when x is real. To address this, relevant code spans from the SymPy codebase need to be identified.

Additionally, 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' contains functions for trigonometric simplification, including 'TR2i', 'TR3', 'TR8', 'TR9', 'TR10i', 'TR11', 'TR12i', and 'TR16', which are likely relevant to the issue.
