The trigsimp function in sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py is likely where the faulty simplification occurs. We should also look at the TrigonometricFunction class and its subclasses (like cos, tan, cot) in sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py to understand how trigonometric expressions are handled. The trigsimp function employs various simplification strategies, including those defined in the 'fu' module and the 'futrig' function. Specifically, the '_trigsimp' and '__trigsimp' functions are deep in the simplification process and could be where the incorrect simplification is happening. The 'futrig' function, which applies a series of transformations ('TR' functions) to trigonometric expressions, is particularly important for understanding how complex trigonometric expressions are simplified. Therefore, the relevant code spans include the trigsimp function, the '_trigsimp' and '__trigsimp' functions, and the 'futrig' function, as well as the trigonometric functions defined in sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py.",
