To address this issue, I should focus on the trigsimp module and closely related trigonometric function definitions to identify where the simplification logic might be incorrectly applied for complex x.

To address this, the following steps were taken:\n1. Identified the relevant files and functions involved in trigonometric simplification, specifically focusing on `trigsimp.py` and `trigonometric.py`.\n2. Analyzed the `trigsimp.py` file to locate the `trigsimp_groebner`, `_trigsimp`, and `__trigsimp` functions which are central to the simplification process.\n3. Examined the `trigonometric.py` file to understand how trigonometric functions like sin, cos, and tan are handled during simplification.\n4. Noticed that the `trigsimp_groebner` function handles the simplification using Groebner bases, potentially where the issue might lie due to incorrect assumptions or handling of complex inputs.\n5. The `_trigsimp` and `__trigsimp` functions also play a crucial role in simplifying trigonometric expressions, and the issue might be related to how expressions are matched and transformed in these functions.\n6. Although specific code spans directly related to the expression `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` were not found, the general strategy and context of the simplification functions indicate where the problem might originate.\n\nGiven the complexity of trigonometric simplification and the need to consider various edge cases, it is likely that the issue arises from general assumptions or specific transformations within these functions.",
