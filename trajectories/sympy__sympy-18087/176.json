Specifically, the expression cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2) is incorrectly simplified as cos(x) + sin(x) for general complex x, despite working correctly for real x. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the search results that deal with trigonometric simplification and potentially involve the handling of complex numbers. The search results include several files and spans that are likely relevant:\n1. In sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py, the span 'trigsimp_groebner' contains the function trigsimp_groebner, which uses Groebner basis for simplification. This could potentially involve handling expressions with complex numbers.\n2. In sympy/simplify/fu.py, the span 'TR10i' contains the TR10i function, which is a rule-based trigonometric simplification function. This may handle specific cases involving sin and cos, potentially including those with complex numbers.\n3. In sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py, the spans 'sin.eval', 'sin._eval_rewrite_as_exp', 'sin._eval_rewrite_as_cos', 'sin._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', 'sin._eval_expand_trig', 'cos.eval', 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', and 'cos._eval_expand_trig' contain evaluation and rewriting methods for sin and cos functions, which may include handling of complex numbers in trigonometric expressions.\nGiven these spans, it is possible that these functions could be involved in the bug described in the issue. However, a detailed review of the code within these spans would be necessary to confirm their relevance and to understand how they handle complex numbers and trigonometric simplification.",
