This suggests that the problem lies within the simplification logic or the evaluation of trigonometric functions when dealing with complex numbers. The files provided include several modules that handle trigonometric functions and their simplifications. Focus should be on the `trigsimp.py`, `trigonometric.py`, and `fu.py` files, which are directly related to trigonometric simplification and expansion. Additionally, it would be useful to check how the `sqrt` function interacts with trigonometric expressions and how complex numbers are handled within these modules.",
