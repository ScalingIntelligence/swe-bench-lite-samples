This error occurs for general complex x, but oddly, it works correctly for real x. The suspected areas of the code that might handle this simplification could be in the trigonometric functions themselves or in the simplification modules designed to handle such expressions. It's worth investigating the `trigsimp` module, the `fu` module for more complex trigonometric simplifications, and the trigonometric function classes where these formulas are defined.",

The expected behavior is that it should not simplify as `cos(x) + sin(x)` for general complex `x`, although it works correctly for real `x`.\n2. The file context provided is empty, indicating no previously identified code spans.\n3. Given the nature of the issue, there are a few likely parts of the codebase that might contain the relevant logic:\n   - The `trigsimp_groebner` function in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` appears to handle trigonometric simplification using Groebner bases, which might be relevant.\n   - The `exptrigsimp` function in the same file also handles trigonometric simplification, potentially also relevant.\n   - The `cos` and `sin` functions in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` may contain the logic used to evaluate the trigonometric functions, which could be relevant if an incorrect simplification occurs here.\n   - The `TR2i` and `TR10i` functions in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` appear to handle trigonometric simplification as well, potentially contributing to the issue.\n4. Given these potential points of interest, the next step would be to examine the identified code spans within these functions to determine if they might contain the logic that incorrectly simplifies the expression in question.",
