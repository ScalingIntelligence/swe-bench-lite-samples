The issue is particularly noticeable with the trigsimp function and its handling of trigonometric functions. To address this, I need to identify code spans that deal with trigonometric functions, their simplification, and evaluation. This includes looking for implementations of sin and cos functions, their evaluation methods, and simplification strategies. I also need to focus on parts of the code responsible for simplifying expressions involving trigonometric functions, such as trigsimp_groebner and _futrig. These sections are crucial for understanding how SymPy handles trigonometric simplifications and can potentially reveal where the incorrect simplification occurs.",
