Given the nature of the issue, it is likely that the problem lies within the trigonometric simplification logic. Since the `trigsimp` function and related trigonometric classes and methods are already highlighted in the context, it is advisable to focus the search on the `trigsimp` function and the methods related to trigonometric operations within the `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` file and the trigonometric function classes in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`. Further, the `sympy/simplify/fu.py` module which contains transformations like TR2i, TR3, etc., should also be considered as these might be involved in how trigonometric expressions are handled.",

The expressions cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2) should not simplify to cos(x) + sin(x) for general complex x, but it seems like the current implementation might be doing so. To address this, we need to look into the trigsimp functions and the trigonometric functions themselves to see how they handle such expressions. The search results include several relevant files and spans: trigsimp.py, trigonometric.py, and fu.py. In trigsimp.py, the spans 'trigsimp_groebner', '__trigsimp', 'trigsimp_old', 'exptrigsimp', 'futrig', and '_trigpats' seem relevant, as they deal with trigonometric simplification strategies. In trigonometric.py, spans 'sin', 'cos', 'sin.eval', 'sin._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', 'sin._eval_expand_trig', 'cos.eval', 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', and 'cos._eval_expand_trig' are relevant, as they deal with the evaluation and simplification of sin and cos functions. In fu.py, spans 'TR2i', 'TR3', 'TR5', 'TR6', 'TR10', 'TR10i', 'TR11', 'TR16', and 'TRpower' are relevant, as they provide further simplification strategies for trigonometric expressions. These spans in the search results should help in identifying where the incorrect simplification might be happening and how to fix it.",
