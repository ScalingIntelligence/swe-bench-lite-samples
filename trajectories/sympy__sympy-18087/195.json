This specific issue seems to be related to the implementation and handling of trigonometric simplifications within the SymPy library. The search results include several key files and functions that might be relevant to this issue. The files 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' and 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' contain functions and methods specifically designed for trigonometric simplification and manipulation, such as 'trigsimp_groebner', 'exptrigsimp', 'sin._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', and '__trigsimp'. These functions handle various aspects of trigonometric simplification, including the use of Groebner bases, exponential rewrite methods, and direct manipulation of sine and cosine functions. Additionally, the file 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' contains more advanced simplification strategies like 'TR10i', which is part of the fu simplification module, designed to handle more complex trigonometric expressions. Given the specific nature of the reported issue, these functions and modules are likely to be where the incorrect simplification behavior is originating from or being influenced. Thus, inspecting these parts of the codebase for how they handle the expression in question would be a good starting point for understanding and addressing the issue.",

The file sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py contains the trigsimp and exptrigsimp functions, which are likely candidates for the code that handles trigonometric simplifications. Additionally, the file sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py contains the definitions for sin and cos functions, which are directly involved in the reported issue.
