Given the context, it is crucial to focus on methods or functions in the trigonometric module that specifically handle simplifications involving `sqrt` and complex numbers. Additionally, identifying other modules interacting with `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` can provide a broader view of how simplification routines are implemented and potentially interact with complex number operations. We will specifically look into methods like `_eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` in the `cos` class and the `_trigsimp` function in `trigsimp.py`, as well as any other relevant modules importing or interfacing with `trigsimp.py`.",
