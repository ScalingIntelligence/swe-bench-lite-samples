The issue is specifically about `trigsimp` incorrectly simplifying `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` to `cos(x) + sin(x)` for general complex `x`, while it correctly simplifies this for real `x`. This suggests a need to review the behavior of the `trigsimp` function with respect to complex inputs. The provided `trigsimp` code spans cover the main `trigsimp` function, its older version (`trigsimp_old`), and helper functions like `futrig`, which is used to simplify trigonometric expressions. Given the issue, it's essential to focus on the logic that handles simplification and checks for complex-valued inputs. The new search results include the `trigsimp_groebner` function, which is used within the `trigsimp` function and handles algebraic simplification using Groebner bases. This function's logic is crucial for ensuring correct simplification of expressions involving trigonometric functions and their squares, especially for complex `x`.",
