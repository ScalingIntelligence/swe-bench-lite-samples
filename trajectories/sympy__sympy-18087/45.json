To address this, we need to look for the implementation of trigonometric simplification functions and the handling of complex arguments in the trigonometric functions.\n\nIn the provided search results, the file 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' contains several spans that are relevant to the issue:\n\n1. The imports span shows that various trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are imported, which is relevant as the issue involves both trigonometric and hyperbolic function simplification.\n\n2. The '_pi_coeff' span is a utility function used to handle coefficients of Pi, which may not be directly related to the issue but is included for completeness.\n\n3. The 'sin' and 'cos' spans include class definitions for sine and cosine functions, both of which are directly related to the issue.\n\n4. The 'sin.taylor_term', 'sin._eval_rewrite_as_exp', 'sin._eval_rewrite_as_Pow', and other rewrites for sin are relevant as they show how the sine function can be rewritten in different forms, which might impact simplification.\n\n5. The 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt' span is of particular interest because it shows how the cosine function can be rewritten in terms of square roots, and this might be directly involved in the incorrect simplification.\n\n6. The 'cos.as_real_imag' and 'sin.as_real_imag' spans show how these functions are decomposed into real and imaginary parts, which is relevant for understanding the behavior with complex arguments.\n\nOverall, these spans provide a good starting point for addressing the issue and diving deeper into the specific areas of the code that handle trigonometric simplifications and complex arguments.",

This discrepancy suggests an issue in the handling of complex versus real input in the trigonometric simplification functions. The search results should focus on identifying parts of the code where trigonometric simplifications are performed, particularly where the handling of complex and real numbers diverges.

This suggests that the simplification logic in the trigsimp function might be flawed for complex inputs. The search results primarily include functions related to trigonometric simplification in the trigsimp.py file. Notably, the trigsimp function and the older version of trigsimp_old are found, which both handle trigonometric simplification but with different methods. These methods include using the fu tool, matching, Groebner bases, and a combined approach. The issue could be related to any of these methods when dealing with complex numbers. The identified code spans overlap with the reported issue, as they contain the logic for trigonometric simplification and might be the location where the incorrect simplification for complex numbers occurs.
