This issue occurs for general complex `x` but works correctly for real `x`. The primary focus should be on the `trigsimp` function and its related modules. Analyzing the search results: - `trigsimp_groebner` function relates to trigonometric simplification using Groebner bases, potentially relevant due to its trigonometric simplification approach. - `exptrigsimp` function simplifies expressions containing trigonometric and exponential functions. - `trigsimp_old` function is an older version of `trigsimp`, possibly relevant for understanding historical behavior. - `_trigpats` function generates patterns for trigonometric simplification, relevant for pattern matching in `trigsimp`. - `_trigsimp` and `__trigsimp` functions are internal implementations of the trigonometric simplification logic. - `futrig` function applies advanced trigonometric simplification rules. Given the focus on `trigsimp` and the related modules, the identified code spans are likely relevant to the issue. The `trigsimp_groebner` and `__trigsimp` functions are particularly relevant as they directly involve the logic used in trigonometric simplification. The `cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` and `sin._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` methods in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` are also relevant as they handle rewriting trigonometric functions as square roots, potentially impacting the simplification process.",

Specifically, `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is incorrectly simplified as `cos(x) + sin(x)` for general complex `x`, though it works correctly if `x` is real. This issue can be traced to the `trigsimp` function and the underlying trigonometric simplification logic in SymPy.\n\nFrom the search results, it is evident that the relevant code spans are primarily located in the `trigsimp.py` and `trigonometric.py` files. These files contain the core logic for trigonometric simplifications, including the specific functions `trigsimp`, `_trigsimp`, `__trigsimp`, and the trigonometric functions `sin` and `cos`. The spans identified in these files are likely to be crucial for addressing the reported issue. Therefore, I will proceed to include these spans in the file context for further analysis and potential modifications.\n\nThe identified spans are:\n- `trigsimp` in `trigsimp.py`\n- `_trigsimp` in `trigsimp.py`\n- `__trigsimp` in `trigsimp.py`\n- `sin._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` in `trigonometric.py`\n- `cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` in `trigonometric.py`\n\nThese spans include the functions responsible for simplifying trigonometric expressions and the specific methods that handle the rewriting of sine and cosine functions as square roots. Including these spans in the relevant file context will allow for a detailed analysis of the code that might be causing the incorrect simplification.",
