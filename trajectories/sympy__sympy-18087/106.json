            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates that the simplification of a trigonometric expression fails in various versions of SymPy, specifically when attempting to simplify cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2). It mentions that the simplification incorrectly treats cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2) as cos(x) + sin(x) for general complex x, but gets it right if x is real. The issue is reported to be found in the trigonometric simplification module of SymPy.\n\nTwo main files are mentioned in the file context, 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' and 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py'. The first file contains definitions and evaluations for trigonometric functions like sin and cos, their rewrites as sqrt, and evaluations of expansions. The second file involves simplification functions like trigsimp and specific matchers for trigonometric expressions.\n\nGiven the issue is about the incorrect simplification of expressions involving cos and sin, particularly with the function cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2), we need to inspect how SymPy attempts to simplify such expressions to understand why it might be failing specifically for complex x. The primary code spans detailed in the file context involve methods corresponding to each trigonometric function's evaluation and simplification techniques, which hints at how SymPy might be managing these expressions. However, the exact problem span is not immediately evident from the provided information.\n\nThus, to drill down further, the identified spans must be refined to pinpoint the exact area where the incorrect simplification might be originating, possibly within the methods that handle the rewrite or expansion of these trigonometric functions. This exploration would involve scrutinizing how the function sqrt(sin(x)**2) might be reducing prematurely, assuming the identity sin(x)**2 == sin(x) instead of maintaining the absolute value of sin.",
