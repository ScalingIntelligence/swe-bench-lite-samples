The SymPy library should correctly handle such expressions, but it appears to have issues, particularly in versions including 1.5. The main focus is on the trigonometric functions and their handling within SymPy's codebase. We need to identify sections of code that handle simplification of trigonometric expressions, especially those that deal with cosine and sine functions. From the search results, we observe several key sections in the code related to trigonometric functions: 'sin._eval_expand_trig', 'cos.eval', 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sin', 'cos._eval_expand_trig', and 'trigsimp'. These sections suggest critical parts of the trigonometric simplification routines within SymPy. By examining these parts, we can determine whether they correctly handle the specific case in question or whether they need corrections. The presence of 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sin' indicates SymPy's attempt to rewrite cosine expressions in terms of sine, which might be relevant to the issue at hand. The 'trigsimp' function appears to be the main simplification routine for trigonometric expressions, and understanding its operations could be crucial. Therefore, examining the aforementioned code spans should provide insight into the correctness and improvements needed for handling the mentioned trigonometric expression.",

The issue specifically mentions that this expression is simplified incorrectly as cos(x) + sin(x) for general complex x, which should not be the case. The analysis of the provided code spans indicates that the relevant code sections deal with trigonometric function definitions and simplification techniques. Specifically, the function '_eval_expand_trig' in classes 'sin' and 'cos' are critical for understanding how the system expands and simplifies trigonometric expressions. Additionally, the function 'trigsimp' in the 'trigsimp.py' file and the 'fu' function in 'fu.py' are key for implementing the trigonometric simplification algorithms used by the system. Consequently, the identified spans of code in 'trigonometric.py', 'trigsimp.py', and 'fu.py' are directly related to the functionality where the reported issue might reside. Therefore, these spans are relevant for diagnosing and potentially fixing the reported issue.",
