The issue specifically points to the behavior of trigsimp, so the focus should be on understanding how this function and related components process and simplify complex trigonometric expressions. Looking through the provided search results, notable functions and spans include: trigsimp_groebner in trigsimp.py, which uses Groebner bases for simplification and could potentially handle such expressions; exptrigsimp for handling expressions involving both trigonometric and exponential functions; and functions in fu.py like TR10i, which perform specific transformations on trigonometric identities. Given these leads, the goal is to pinpoint which of these functions and their behaviors are directly or indirectly involved in the reported simplification error.",

Specifically, it mentions that cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2) is incorrectly simplified as cos(x) + sin(x) for general complex x, whereas it works correctly for real x. The issue is present in various versions including 1.5. This indicates a need to investigate the trigsimp function and related code spans to understand how the simplification is handled for complex vs real numbers.\n\nThe provided file context includes code spans from `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` and `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, which are relevant as they contain functions like `trigsimp_groebner`, `exptrigsimp`, `TR10i`, and imports relevant to trigonometric simplification. These are likely places to start looking for the root cause of the issue.\n\nNew search results provide additional code spans including `trig_split` from `fu.py`, which is part of the trigonometric simplification process. Additionally, `sin` class from `trigonometric.py` is included, which might have implications for how `sin(x)**2` is handled in the expression. Lastly, `_trigsimp` and `futrig` from `trigsimp.py` are shown, which are also relevant to the simplification process.\n\nGiven these results, the identified spans should be `trigsimp_groebner`, `exptrigsimp`, `TR10i`, `trig_split`, `_trigsimp`, and `futrig`, as they are directly related to the reported issue by being part of the trigonometric simplification logic in Sympy.",
