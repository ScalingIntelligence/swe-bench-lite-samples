The issue was identified while writing SymPy-based teaching material, emphasizing the need for correct behavior in learning materials.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, key functions and transformations relevant to trigonometric simplification are spread across several modules, primarily in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` and `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`.\n\nIn `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`, functions like `trigsimp`, `_trigsimp`, and `__trigsimp` are foundational for general trigonometric simplification. They handle expressions by applying various strategies, including matching and transforming using pattern-based approaches.\n\nIn `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, the module offers more specific transformation rules like `TR2i`, `TR3`, `TR5`, `TR6`, `TR8`, `TR9`, `TR10`, `TR10i`, `TR11`, `TR12i`, `TRmorrie`, `TR14`, `TR15`, `TR16`, and `TRpower`. These transformations are intended to handle different aspects of trigonometric expressions, including sums, products, powers, and specific function combinations.\n\nSpecifically, `TR2i` tackles multiplication in trigonometric functions, which could be relevant for expressions involving products of sine and cosine. `TR10` and `TR10i` target addition and subtraction in trigonometric functions, potentially relevant for expressions like cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2), where an addition of trigonometric terms occurs. Furthermore, `TR15` and `TR16` focus on simplifying powers of trigonometric functions, which could influence how sqrt(sin(x)**2) is handled.\n\nGiven the specific issue with sqrt(sin(x)**2) being incorrectly simplified for complex x, transformations dealing with powers and specific trigonometric identities (like `TR15` and `TR16`) are particularly relevant. Additionally, the general simplification strategies in `trigsimp` and its underlying functions will also play a key role in ensuring overall correct simplification of such expressions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` and `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` are pertinent to addressing the reported issue, as they contain mechanisms that handle various aspects of trigonometric simplification, including those directly related to the problematic expression in question.",
