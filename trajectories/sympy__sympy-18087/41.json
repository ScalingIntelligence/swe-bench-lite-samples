The problem is that this simplification does not hold for general complex x, although it works correctly for real x. This suggests that the issue likely lies in the simplification logic or the handling of complex numbers in the trigonometric simplification functions. As a starting point, we should focus on functions and methods that are directly involved in trigonometric simplification and expansion, particularly those handling square roots and general complex number cases. We should also look into the main trigonometric simplification module, specifically addressing the `trigsimp` function and related internal functions.",

The issue specifically mentions that `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is incorrectly simplified as `cos(x) + sin(x)` for general complex x, but works correctly if x is real. To solve this issue, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code responsible for the trigonometric simplification. The search results provide several key sections of the code that are likely related to this issue:\n\n1. `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` contains the `trigsimp_groebner`, `exptrigsimp`, `trigsimp_old`, and `__trigsimp` functions, all of which are likely involved in the simplification process.\n\n2. `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` contains the definitions and manipulations of trigonometric functions such as `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.\n\n3. `sympy/simplify/fu.py` contains various trigonometric simplification strategies like `TR2i`, `TR3`, `TR8`, etc.\n\nBy examining these sections, we can pinpoint the specific areas of the codebase that might be responsible for the incorrect simplification and suggest possible corrections.",
