The code spans provided in the search results include several functions related to trigonometric simplification and evaluation. Specifically, `trigsimp_groebner`, `trigsimp_old`, `_trigsimp`, `futrig`, `_futrig`, `exptrigsimp`, and the `TR` functions in `sympy/simplify/fu.py` are relevant, as they handle various aspects of trigonometric expression simplification. Additionally, the `_eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` methods in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` handle rewriting trigonometric functions in terms of sqrt, which might be relevant for the incorrect simplification observed.\n\n1. Analyzing the `trigsimp_old` function in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`, it seems to handle the initial steps of trigonometric simplification, possibly including the incorrect simplification. This function would need a closer look.\n\n2. The `_trigsimp` and `__trigsimp` functions also appear to be involved in detailed trigonometric simplification processes, possibly implementing or triggering the incorrect behavior.\n\n3. The `trigsimp_groebner` function uses Groebner bases for simplification, which might also participate in the process.\n\n4. The `futrig` and `_futrig` functions are designed for more advanced trigonometric simplification using various transformation rules, including those starting with `TR` in `sympy/simplify/fu.py`. These might be where the incorrect simplification specifically occurs.\n\n5. The `_eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` methods for `sin`, `cos`, and other trigonometric functions in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` are crucial since they focus on rewriting the trigonometric functions in terms of sqrt, directly relevant to the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans are spread across multiple files and include functions responsible for various stages of trigonometric simplification. Focusing on the functions that handle the actual simplification process and those involved in rewriting trigonometric expressions in terms of sqrt will be crucial for addressing the issue.",

This involves changes in the logic that processes trigonometric functions and their squares, likely within the main simplification loop or related matchers. Given the extensive and interwoven nature of the code within the specified lines, focusing specifically on the handling of sqrt(sin(x)**2) would require changes in multiple places that deal with expressions involving sin(x)**2. Due to the complexity and breadth of the code, it's impractical to narrow down the modification points within the token limit.",
