This error occurs specifically when simplifying `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` as though it were `cos(x) + sin(x)` for general complex x, while it works correctly for real x. Given the nature of the issue, the focus should be on the trigonometric simplification functions and specifically on the `trigsimp` function and its related modules. The relevant classes and functions in the context provided include `sin`, `cos`, `trigsimp`, `_trigsimp`, `futrig`, and `_futrig`. By targeting these functions and classes in the search, we can identify the code responsible for the incorrect simplification.",

These lines are around lines 272-283, specifically where `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` might be handled.",
