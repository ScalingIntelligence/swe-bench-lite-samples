Based on the file context, the relevant files identified are related to trigonometric functions and simplification. The focus should be on understanding how `trigsimp` handles complex numbers and how it simplifies expressions involving `cos` and `sin` functions.",

The methods _eval_expand_trig and _eval_rewrite_as_sqrt in the classes sin and cos are relevant as they deal with the expansion and rewriting of trigonometric expressions.\n\nThe search results include parts of trigsimp.py, which is likely responsible for trigonometric simplification. The function __trigsimp seems to be a key part of the simplification process, handling various patterns and rewriting rules. Additionally, the function futrig is present, which uses more advanced trigonometric simplification techniques.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the relevant code spans should include those dealing with trigonometric simplification logic, especially for complex numbers. The spans that include 'trigsimp_old', '__trigsimp', and 'futrig' are the most pertinent as they cover the main trigonometric simplification functions.\n\nThe identified spans should help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue reported.",

            "scratch_pad": "The issue reported involves the incorrect simplification of a trigonometric expression using 'trigsimp' in various versions of SymPy, including 1.5. The expression in question is cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2), which is incorrectly simplified as cos(x) + sin(x) for general complex x. This occurs despite the function getting it right if x is real.\n\nThe current file context shows code spans from 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' that deal with trigonometric functions like sin and cos, including their rewriting and expansion methods. The 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' file context shows methods for trigonometric simplification.\n\nThe new search results provide additional code spans in the same 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' file, focusing on methods like 'taylor_term', 'rewrite_as_exp', 'rewrite_as_pow', 'rewrite_as_sqrt', 'rewrite_as_csc', and 'rewrite_as_sec' for the sin function, and 'rewrite_as_sqrt' and 'expand_trig' for the cos function. These methods are directly related to how trigonometric functions are expanded or rewritten in terms of other functions, which aligns with the issue at hand.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, the identified code spans in the 'trigonometric.py' file seem highly relevant. These spans deal with the specific ways that trigonometric functions can be rewritten or expanded, which is central to the incorrect simplification observed. Thus, I identify these spans as relevant to the reported issue and conclude that the search task is complete with these results.",
