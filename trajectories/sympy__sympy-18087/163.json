This suggests a need to inspect the simplification logic involving cos, sin, and their relationships, especially in code related to trigonometric simplification. The search results encompass multiple critical functions and import statements from 'sympy.simplify.trigsimp.py' that are pertinent to this issue. Relevant functions include 'trigsimp_groebner', 'exptrigsimp', 'trigsimp_old', '_trigpats', '_match_div_rewrite', '_trigsimp', '__trigsimp', 'futrig', and '_futrig'. These functions encapsulate the logic for simplifying trigonometric expressions using Groebner bases, rewriting expressions in terms of exponential and cosine, and various patterns matching for trigonometric identities. The 'sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric.py' file also contains essential classes and methods like 'sin', 'cos', and their evaluation and expansion methods, which are foundational for implementing trigonometric functions and their properties. Given the complexity and scope of the reported issue, these code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the simplification mistake across different types of inputs, especially focusing on behavior differences between real and complex numbers in trigonometric simplification logic.",
