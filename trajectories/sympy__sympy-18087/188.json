To identify the relevant code spans, I will focus on the functions and transformations that directly deal with trigonometric functions and their simplifications, especially those that might involve handling cos, sin, and sqrt. Given the complexity and the depth of the issue, it's important to closely inspect the specific transformations and simplifications that could potentially lead to the erroneous behavior described. The search results include various transformation functions (TR10i, TR11, TR16, etc.) and the main trigsimp function, all of which are likely to be relevant for addressing the reported issue. The code spans that are particularly noteworthy are those that process trigonometric functions, check for specific conditions, and apply transformations or simplifications.

        "message": "The search returned 7 results. But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\n1. Analyzed the reported issue: The issue pertains to incorrect simplification of a trigonometric expression, specifically involving cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2). The simplification is incorrect for general complex x, but correct for real x. This suggests that the simplification algorithm may have specific logic for real numbers that does not generalize to complex numbers.\n\n2. Reviewed the current file context: The provided code spans from 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' and 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py'. Several functions such as TR2i, TR3, TR8, TR10i, TR11, TR12i, TR14, TR16, and TRpower are likely involved in the simplification process. The file context does not show a direct handling of the sqrt(sin(x)**2) case specifically.\n\n3. Processed new search results: The new search results from 'trigsimp.py' and 'fu.py' showed relevant functions such as 'trigsimp', 'TR2i', 'TR8', 'TR14', and 'TR16'. These functions handle various aspects of trigonometric simplification, including specific patterns and rules for simplification. 'TR16' in particular handles cases involving cos in the denominator, which might be related to the issue. However, none of the code spans directly addressed the sqrt(sin(x)**2) case or its handling for complex numbers.\n\n4. Made a decision: Based on the analysis, the search results did not provide a direct solution or relevant code span that addresses the specific issue of incorrect simplification of cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2) for general complex x. More investigation into the exact part of the algorithm handling this case for real numbers and how it generalizes (or doesn't) to complex numbers is needed.",
