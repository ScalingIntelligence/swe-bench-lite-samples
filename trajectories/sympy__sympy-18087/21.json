The problem occurs with the expression cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2), which is simplified incorrectly as cos(x) + sin(x) for general complex x. This issue is specific to 'trigsimp' and how it handles certain trigonometric identities or evaluations. The relevant files identified as potentially related include various trigonometric functions and simplification methods. Focusing on 'trigsimp' and its associated methods in 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py' and 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' is crucial for locating the exact code causing the incorrect simplification.",

This identity is not currently included in the build_ideal function. The relevant section to update is where the relations for the ideal are built, specifically handling sin and cos functions.
