The issue seems to arise when dealing with general complex x, though it works correctly for real x. By analyzing the provided search results, we can identify key areas of the codebase that might be relevant for addressing this issue.\n\nFirstly, the search results include files from the SymPy library such as 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' and 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py'. These files contain definitions of trigonometric functions (sin, cos) and simplification functions (trigsimp) which are directly related to the problem. Specifically, there are code spans devoted to evaluating and rewriting trigonometric functions which could potentially include the code responsible for the incorrect simplification.\n\nWithin 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py', relevant spans include 'sin.eval', 'sin._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt', and 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt'. These sections handle the evaluation and transformation of sine and cosine functions into other forms, potentially impacting how 'sqrt(sin(x)**2)' is handled. Additionally, 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sqrt' might be particularly relevant as it involves rewriting cos in terms of sqrt which might be used during simplification of trigonometric expressions.\n\nWithin 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py', the 'trigsimp' function and the internal function '__trigsimp' are significant. These functions directly address the simplification of trigonometric expressions, and any incorrect handling of the expression in question likely occurs within these scopes. The '_trigsimp' function and the 'futrig' function could also play a role as they are involved in recursive simplification and specific transformations on trigonometric expressions, respectively.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue and the code spans available, focusing on these areas could provide insights into the incorrect simplification of the specific expression. Additionally, examining how 'sqrt(sin(x)**2)' is processed and simplified within these contexts could help identify the root cause of the issue.",

Given this, it's important to identify the relevant code spans that handle trigonometric simplification and specifically the handling of complex numbers in trigonometric functions. From the provided file context and search results, the following code spans are relevant:\n\n1. `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` - This file contains the definitions of trigonometric functions and their evaluation methods. The spans related to `sin` and `cos` functions, especially their `eval` and `_eval_rewrite_as_sqrt` methods, are relevant because they handle the simplification and evaluation of these functions.\n\n2. `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` - This file contains the implementation of `trigsimp`, which is the main function for trigonometric simplification. The spans related to `trigsimp`, `futrig`, and specific trig simplification methods like `TR10i` in the `fu` module are relevant because they handle the main logic for trigonometric simplification.\n\n3. `sympy/simplify/fu.py` - This file contains the `fu` function and related simplification rules (`TR1`, `TR2i`, `TRmorrie`, etc.), which are used within `trigsimp`.
