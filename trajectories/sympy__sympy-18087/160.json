The expression is incorrectly simplified as `cos(x) + sin(x)` for complex x, while it works correctly for real x. The problem likely lies within the trigonometric simplification functions. The relevant files identified so far include those handling trigonometric functions and simplification processes, such as `trigsimp.py` and `fu.py`. We need to focus on functions and methods that handle trigonometric simplification in these files. Specifically, we should look into the `trigsimp` function in `trigsimp.py` and related transformation functions in `fu.py`.",

The expression is incorrectly simplified as `cos(x) + sin(x)` for complex x, while it works correctly for real x. The file context provided includes relevant code from `fu.py` and `trigonometric.py`, which handle trigonometric functions and simplification processes. Specifically, the `trigsimp` function in `fu.py` and related transformation functions in `fu.py` are identified as potential areas of interest. The provided file context does not include the entire `trigsimp.py` file, but the identified sections in `fu.py` and `trigonometric.py` seem to cover the essential parts of the simplification logic for trigonometric expressions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the provided file context is relevant and sufficient to address the reported issue.",
