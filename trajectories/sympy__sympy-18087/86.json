By analyzing the search results, we focus on the spans that involve the core trigonometric simplification functions and methods, especially those where expressions like `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` are handled. This involves examining imports and definitions of trigonometric functions, their simplification strategies, and any related methods that could be potentially involved in the erroneous simplification. We identify several crucial spans in `trigsimp.py` and `fu.py`, which contain relevant methods for trigonometric simplification and manipulation, including `trigsimp_old`, `__trigsimp`, `futrig`, `exptrigsimp`, `TR10i`, and `TR8`. These functions and methods are likely places where the described issue could occur or be addressed.

The search results primarily include additional spans from `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`, particularly focusing on the `trigsimp_old`, `_trigsimp`, and `futrig` functions.\n\nAmong the spans provided, the most relevant to the issue at hand are those handling the simplification of trigonometric expressions, such as `trigsimp_old`, which handles various methods for simplifying trig expressions including 'matching', 'groebner', and 'combined'. The `_trigsimp` function is a wrapper around `__trigsimp` that checks if the expression has trigonometric functions before applying deeper simplification. Additionally, `futrig` function applies futhark's rules to simplify trigonometric expressions, which could be relevant as it transforms expressions to a form that might lead to incorrect simplifications if not handled carefully. These functions are crucial as they implement the main strategies for simplifying trigonometric expressions, which are directly related to the reported issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans in `trigsimp_old`, `_trigsimp`, and `futrig` are pertinent to the reported issue.

The _trigpats function defines patterns for trigonometric simplifications which are likely used in the mentioned issue. The _match_div_rewrite function could also be relevant for rewriting expressions such as division of trigonometric functions.
