The class 'cos' in trigonometric.py includes methods related to rewriting trigonometric functions using sqrt, which is likely involved in the problematic simplification. Additionally, the 'trigsimp' function in trigsimp.py is the main function for simplifying trigonometric expressions and is hence relevant. The provided code snippets do not include the specific method or line where the error in simplifying cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2) is occurring, but they encompass the broader context where such an error would likely be found. Thus, while the exact problematic code line is not provided, the context provided is sufficient to indicate where in the codebase the issue would be addressed.",
