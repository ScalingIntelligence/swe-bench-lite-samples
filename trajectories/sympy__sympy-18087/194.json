For instance, 'cos.eval' checks for specific numerical values and infinity cases, while 'cos._eval_rewrite_as_sin' rewrites cos in terms of sin.

This issue occurs in various versions, including 1.5, for complex x, but it is correctly handled if x is real. The analysis starts by identifying relevant code spans in the provided search results that deal with trigonometric simplification and related functions. The search results reveal several key functions and methods in the sympy library that are likely relevant to this issue: trigsimp_groebner, exptrigsimp, __trigsimp, cos.eval, sin.eval, and various transformation functions (TR10i, TRpower, etc.) in fu.py. These functions and methods involve trigonometric simplifications, rewriting expressions in terms of other trigonometric functions or exponential functions, and handling of trigonometric identities. Based on the alignment with the reported issue, the relevant code spans are chosen. The steps to identify these spans include examining functions that handle trigonometric simplification, checking for code that deals with complex and real numbers in trigonometric expressions, and verifying if there are specific checks or simplifications concerning cos, sin, and their relationships in the code. It is crucial to consider the entire context of the code sections to ensure that the identified spans are directly related to the reported issue of incorrect simplification. Given the detailed analysis, the identified spans are determined to be relevant to the reported issue.",
