This suggests that the issue lies in how the different initialization runs influence the final model parameters or predictions. The provided search results include several relevant code spans in the `BaseMixture` class within `sklearn/mixture/base.py`. Notably, the `__init__`, `fit_predict`, and `predict` methods are of primary interest as they handle initialization, fitting, and prediction processes, respectively. The `fit_predict` method initializes the model parameters multiple times when `n_init` is greater than 1 and selects the best model based on the highest lower bound. On the other hand, the `predict` method simply estimates the log probabilities and returns the cluster with the highest probability. The discrepancy in results might be due to how the model parameters are aggregated or selected after multiple initializations, and examining these methods closely can highlight potential areas of concern.",

Specifically, the inconsistency between `fit_predict` and `predict` methods suggests that the initialization and convergence logic might be affected by the value of `n_init`. The current context includes the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods from the BaseMixture class, both of which are defined in `base.py`. The new search results present the GaussianMixture class and its methods from `gaussian_mixture.py`, including initialization, parameter checking, and the EM steps for parameter estimation. Relevant code spans include the initialization logic in `GaussianMixture._initialize`, the M-step in `GaussianMixture._m_step`, and the calculation of log probabilities in `GaussianMixture._estimate_log_prob`. These code spans are critical as they directly influence how the model parameters are estimated and how predictions are made, especially when multiple initializations (`n_init > 1`) are involved.",
