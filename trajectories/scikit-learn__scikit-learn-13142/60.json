The current file context is empty, meaning no relevant code has been identified yet. From the search results, we can see that the `GaussianMixture` class has `__init__`, `fit_predict`, and `predict` methods defined. These methods are likely to be relevant to the reported issue as they deal directly with the initialization, fitting, and prediction processes of the GaussianMixture model. The `fit_predict` method is responsible for fitting the model and predicting the labels for the training data, while the `predict` method predicts the labels for new data after the model has been fitted. Given the issue description, it's likely that the problem arises from the differing initialization processes when `n_init` is set to a value greater than 1. Therefore, the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods, along with any internal functions they call (like `_e_step` and `_m_step`), are the most relevant sections to investigate. The `__init__` method is also relevant as it initializes the parameters that influence the behavior of `fit_predict` and `predict`.",
