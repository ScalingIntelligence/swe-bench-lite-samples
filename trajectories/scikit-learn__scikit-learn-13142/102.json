This suggests that the methods are not producing consistent results under certain initialization conditions. To address this, I need to identify relevant code spans that deal with the initialization (`n_init`), the methods `fit_predict` and `predict`, and any logic that might affect the consistency of their outputs. The provided search results contain both the `GaussianMixture` class with its `__init__` method and the `BaseMixture` class with its `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. Each of these spans is relevant to understanding the issue. Specifically, `GaussianMixture.__init__` deals with initialization parameters including `n_init`, `BaseMixture.fit_predict` involves the fitting and prediction logic, and `BaseMixture.predict` directly concerns the prediction functionality that should align with the output of `fit_predict`. Therefore, these spans are directly related to the reported issue.",
