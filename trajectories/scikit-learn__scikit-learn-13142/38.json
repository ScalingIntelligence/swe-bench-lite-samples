This discrepancy suggests that there may be an issue with how the model is being initialized or how the predictions are being computed during the multiple initialization runs. The search results provide relevant code spans that could be involved in this process, particularly the initialization (`GaussianMixture._initialize`), the M-step (`GaussianMixture._m_step`), and the method for estimating log probabilities (`GaussianMixture._estimate_log_prob`). These sections of the code are critical for understanding how the model parameters are set and updated during the fitting process, which is likely where the discrepancy arises when `n_init` is set. Additionally, the `GaussianMixture.__init__` method shows how the `n_init` parameter is accepted and could potentially be a source of the issue if not handled correctly. The `_check_parameters` method also validates the inputs, which could be relevant if the `n_init` value affects the model's parameter settings. Finally, the `_estimate_log_gaussian_prob` function is directly involved in calculating probabilities, which are central to both `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. Identifying these spans of code will help pinpoint where the logic differs when `n_init` is greater than 1.",
