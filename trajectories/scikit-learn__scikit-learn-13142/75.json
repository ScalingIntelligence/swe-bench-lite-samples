This suggests that the initialization of the model might not be consistent or that the multiple initializations are not converging to the same optimal solution. Given the issue, the relevant code spans should include those that handle the initialization (`_initialize` method), the parameter estimation in the M-step (`_m_step` method), and the methods for prediction (`_estimate_log_prob` and `_estimate_log_weights`). These sections of the code are critical for understanding how the initializations are handled and how the predictions are derived. Additionally, the constructor (`__init__` method) is important for understanding how the `n_init` parameter influences the model's behavior. The unit test `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` should also be reviewed to ensure it captures the scenario where `n_init` is greater than 1, but it is not included in the provided search results.",

To address this, the relevant code spans should include parts where `n_init` is handled, as well as the implementation of `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. From the provided context and search results, we see that `GaussianMixture` class has methods such as `__init__`, `_initialize`, `_m_step`, `_estimate_log_prob`, and `_estimate_log_weights`. Additionally, the `fit_predict` method in the `BaseMixture` class is identified as crucial since it controls the main flow of the fitting process, including handling multiple initializations when `n_init` is greater than 1. All these parts are relevant as they might contribute to the observed inconsistency when `n_init` is specified.\n\nThe identification of relevant code spans should focus on the `GaussianMixture` class methods and properties that handle or interact with the `n_init` parameter. This includes the `__init__` method where `n_init` is defined, the `_initialize` method which sets initial parameters, and the `fit_predict` method from the `BaseMixture` class where the actual fitting and prediction occur.",
