This discrepancy is not caught by the existing unit test `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` because it does not set `n_init`. To address this, it's necessary to inspect both the initialization and the implementation of these methods in the GaussianMixture class. The provided search results primarily focus on the implementation of the GaussianMixture class within `gaussian_mixture.py` and the base class within `base.py`. The relevant spans include the `__init__` method of GaussianMixture, which allows the setting of `n_init`, and the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods in the BaseMixture class. These methods are directly involved in the logic described in the issue. By examining these spans, we can understand how `n_init` affects the initialization and iteration processes during fitting and prediction. These code spans are deemed relevant because they encapsulate the functionality that could lead to the observed discrepancy when `n_init` is set, thus aligning with the reported issue.",

The code includes a loop over `n_init` to perform initialization, and the `fit_predict` method updates parameters if a new initialization yields a better lower bound.
