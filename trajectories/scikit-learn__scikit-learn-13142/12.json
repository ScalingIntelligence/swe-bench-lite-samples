The fit_predict method involves parameter initialization, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and convergence checks, while the predict method estimates the weighted log probabilities to make predictions.

It iterates `n_init` times, each time potentially initializing parameters differently, and selects the best outcome based on the computed lower bound. The `predict` method does not appear to involve `n_init` directly, which might explain the discrepancy noted in the issue. This difference could stem from differing internal states or parameter sets between the runs that `fit_predict` and `predict` see. Next, I need to investigate the specifics of the initialization logic to understand how different settings of `n_init` might affect the outcome.
