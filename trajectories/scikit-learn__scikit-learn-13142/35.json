The search results provided include multiple files and spans of code related to Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and other clustering algorithms, but the focus should be on `gaussian_mixture.py` and `base.py`, which contain the core functionalities of the `GaussianMixture` class and its base class `BaseMixture`. The spans of interest include the initialization (`__init__`), the method for setting parameters (`_set_parameters`), and the method for checking parameters (`_check_parameters`) in `gaussian_mixture.py`, as well as the `fit_predict` method in `base.py`. These spans are relevant because they directly involve the initialization, configuration, and fitting processes of the GMM, which are critical in understanding why `fit_predict` and `predict` might differ when `n_init` is high. Additionally, the `fit_predict` method in `base.py` is particularly relevant as it encapsulates the fitting process and subsequent prediction, making it a prime candidate for investigating discrepancies.
