The issue raises concerns about the initialization and convergence of the GMM when multiple initializations are allowed. From the search results, the following spans are identified to be directly relevant:\n\n- `BaseMixture.fit_predict`: This method is central to the issue as it performs the fit and predict operations together, potentially leading to different results when `n_init` is greater than 1.\n- `BaseMixture.predict`: This method performs the prediction after the model has been fitted and is directly compared with `fit_predict` in the reported issue.\n- `GaussianMixture.__init__`: This method initializes the `GaussianMixture` object and includes the `n_init` parameter, which is at the heart of the issue.\n- `GaussianMixture._initialize`: This method is responsible for initializing the parameters of the GMM, which is crucial when `n_init > 1`, as it determines the starting point for each initialization attempt.\n- `GaussianMixture._m_step`: This method performs the maximization step of the EM algorithm, which updates the model parameters, and is relevant as multiple initializations could lead to different parameter estimates.\n\nThese spans cover the key functionalities related to the `fit_predict`, `predict`, and initialization processes in the `GaussianMixture` class.
