Key aspects observed were methods `_m_step`, `_estimate_log_prob`, `_estimate_log_weights`, `_compute_lower_bound`, and the `_initialize` method across different classes. 4. Identified and extracted relevant code spans that directly deal with initialization, E-step, M-step, and prediction processes which are critical for the reported issue. Notably, the `_initialize` method in `GaussianMixture` and `fit_predict` in `BaseMixture` seem most relevant. 5.

Additionally, the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods are also present in the BaseMixture class, which GaussianMixture inherits from. Although the context does not directly show the handling of the `n_init` parameter within these methods, it does provide a framework from which one could investigate further. The `_initialize` method in particular is crucial as it sets up the parameters for each initialization, which could differ across runs if `n_init` is greater than 1. The `_e_step` method, which calculates the expectation step in the EM algorithm, could also be key to understanding the differences in results caused by multiple initializations. Therefore, while the provided context does not cover every aspect in detail, it lays a solid foundation for further investigation, especially focusing on how `n_init` affects the initialization process and subsequent steps.",

The `_initialize` method in `GaussianMixture` is responsible for setting the initial parameters, which may differ across multiple initializations if `n_init` is greater than 1. Additionally, the `fit_predict` method in `BaseMixture` shows how multiple initializations are managed, including a loop over `n_init` runs. This loop initializes parameters, performs the E and M steps, and evaluates the results, keeping the best model based on the lower bound of log-likelihood.
