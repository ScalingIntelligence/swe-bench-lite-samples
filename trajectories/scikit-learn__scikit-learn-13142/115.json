From the search results, I identified two files: `base.py` and `bayesian_mixture.py`. In `base.py`, there are several relevant methods including `fit_predict`, `predict`, and their respective utility methods like `_check_initial_parameters`, `_initialize_parameters`, and `_initialize`. These methods are essential for understanding the initialization and prediction processes in `GaussianMixture`. In `bayesian_mixture.py`, the `BayesianGaussianMixture` class inherits from `BaseMixture` and defines additional methods that could affect the behavior of `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. It includes `_initialize`, `_estimate_weights`, `_estimate_means`, and `_estimate_precisions`, among others. These methods are likely to be involved in the parameter estimation and could potentially lead to differences in the outcomes when `n_init` is set to a value greater than 1. Both files and their methods are relevant to the reported issue as they contain the core logic responsible for fitting the model and making predictions.",
