To address this, it's crucial to examine the implementation of these methods and ensure they are aligned. From the search results, both `GaussianMixture` and `BaseMixture` classes are relevant, with `BaseMixture` containing the actual implementations of `fit_predict` and `predict`. The `fit_predict` method initializes parameters and performs iterations until convergence, while the `predict` method simply returns the labels based on the current parameters without further optimization. The divergence observed in the issue is likely due to the multiple initialization attempts (`n_init`) affecting the outcome of `fit_predict` but not `predict`.
