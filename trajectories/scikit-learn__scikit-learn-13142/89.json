The issue suggests that the current unit test `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` does not account for this scenario as it does not set `n_init`. \n\nReviewing the provided code spans, I identified the relevant parts for this issue mainly in the `gaussian_mixture.py` and `base.py` files. In `gaussian_mixture.py`, the `GaussianMixture` class is defined with its constructor `__init__` method, which includes the `n_init` parameter.\n\nIn `base.py`, the `BaseMixture` class contains the implementation of the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. The `fit_predict` method initializes and iteratively optimizes the model parameters, while the `predict` method estimates the log probabilities and returns the class with the highest probability. Both methods call the `_check_X` function to validate the input data.\n\nThese spans are crucial to understand how the `n_init` parameter might affect the results of `fit_predict` and `predict` and to potentially debug or modify the code to ensure consistency when `n_init` is greater than 1.",
