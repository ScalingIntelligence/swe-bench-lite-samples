This discrepancy is not covered by the existing unit test `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict`. The search results provide important context through the `sklearn/mixture/base.py` file, which contains the implementation of `BaseMixture`, the parent class of `GaussianMixture`. Inside this file, we find the relevant methods `fit_predict` and `predict`. The `fit_predict` method initializes the model parameters, performs multiple inits if specified (`n_init`), and optimizes iteratively. It then returns the cluster assignments based on the log responsibilities. The `predict` method, on the other hand, simply checks if the model is fitted and then estimates the log probabilities to predict the clusters. This setup allows for an in-depth analysis of how `n_init` affects the outcomes of these methods. The current context lacks direct evidence of the issue, as the provided code spans do not show the actual discrepancy when `n_init` is set. However, understanding the flow and logic of these methods is crucial for addressing the issue, likely necessitating further investigation into how the multiple inits affect parameter initialization and optimization.",

The provided search results contain implementations of the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods within the `BaseMixture` class which are inherited by `GaussianMixture`. Additionally, the `GaussianMixture` class has specific implementations for parameter checks, initialization, and computation of the log Gaussian probability, which are all relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue. While the `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` unit test was mentioned as not catching this issue, there is no direct search result for the test code.
