The provided search results contain several code spans that are relevant to the issue. Specifically, the `BaseMixture` class and its methods `fit_predict` and `predict` are included. The `fit_predict` method involves initial parameter checking, multiple initializations, and an iterative process to convergence, which is controlled by the `n_init` parameter. The `predict` method, on the other hand, directly estimates and returns the most probable class for each sample without the iterative fitting process. These methods and their interactions with the `n_init` parameter seem to be directly related to the issue described. Additionally, the `_check_X` function, which is used within these methods, ensures that the input data `X` meets certain criteria, but this function itself does not seem directly related to the discrepancy issue. The identified code spans provide a good starting point to investigate and potentially address the reported issue regarding the disagreement between `fit_predict` and `predict` when `n_init` is specified.",
