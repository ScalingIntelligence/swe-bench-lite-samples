This indicates that the initialization process with multiple initializations (`n_init > 1`) might not be consistently picking the best model, leading to different clustering results after fitting versus predicting. The provided search results include the relevant code spans for `BaseMixture` class which implements both `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. The `fit_predict` method initializes the model parameters, performs the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, and selects the best model based on the likelihood. It also calculates the log-responsibilities (`log_resp`) for the final model and returns the labels based on the highest responsibilities. The `predict` method uses the already trained model parameters to predict the labels for new data based on the estimated log probabilities (`_estimate_weighted_log_prob`). It's crucial to review the initialization process and the EM steps to ensure consistency in the model selection when `n_init` is greater than 1.",
