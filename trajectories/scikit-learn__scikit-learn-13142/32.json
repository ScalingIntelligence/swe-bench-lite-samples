The issue pertains to the behavior of `fit_predict` and `predict` methods when `n_init` is greater than 1, suggesting discrepancies in their outputs. Given this, we should examine the initialization, fitting, and prediction processes. The relevant spans appear to be those that deal with initialization (`__init__`, `_initialize`), fitting processes (`_m_step`), and prediction processes (`_estimate_log_prob`, `_estimate_log_weights`). These spans are crucial for understanding how the model parameters are initialized with multiple random initializations (`n_init` > 1) and how the model fits and predicts data under these conditions. Therefore, focusing on these spans will help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue where `fit_predict` and `predict` methods do not align when `n_init` > 1.",
