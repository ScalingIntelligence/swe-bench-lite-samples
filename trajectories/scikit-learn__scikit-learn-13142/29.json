This suggests that the random initialization might be leading to different results, which is a critical part of the model fitting process. The relevant parts of the code should include the initialization and the steps that involve repeated initializations due to the `n_init` parameter. I've identified the constructor (__init__), the initialization method (_initialize), and the M-step method (_m_step) of the `GaussianMixture` class as relevant, especially how they handle the `n_init` parameter. The identification and modification of these sections are crucial for resolving the reported issue.",

The issue reports discrepancies between `fit_predict` and `predict` when `n_init` is greater than 1, which is adequately covered by the provided context. The context also explains how the `n_init` parameter influences these methods through multiple initializations and the selection of the best model. The test case scenario mentioned in the issue, which compares results of `fit_predict` and `predict` under different `n_init` values, can be traced through the provided code sections.
