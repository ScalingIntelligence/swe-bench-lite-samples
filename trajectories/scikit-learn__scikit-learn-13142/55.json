Given the context, it's clear that both `fit_predict` and `predict` methods are part of the `GaussianMixture` class. The immediate step is to focus on `gaussian_mixture.py` and `base.py` since they contain definitions for the `GaussianMixture` class and the `BaseMixture` class respectively, which `GaussianMixture` inherits from. These files are likely to hold the implementation of the methods in question. Additionally, considering the issue relates to `n_init` parameter handling, precise search terms should be used to isolate the relevant code blocks for further investigation.",

This suggests that the initialization or the multiple initializations specified by `n_init` might not be properly handled, leading to different clustering outcomes between the two methods. The relevant code sections to investigate would be the `__init__`, `_initialize`, `fit_predict`, and `predict` methods of the `GaussianMixture` class. Additionally, the `_estimate_gaussian_parameters` function, which is used in the initialization process, could also be a key part to examine for understanding how different initializations impact the model parameters. The search results provided include these specific spans, which can be crucial for diagnosing the issue. Further, the `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` unit test should also be reviewed to ensure it properly tests the scenario where `n_init` is set to a value greater than 1.",
