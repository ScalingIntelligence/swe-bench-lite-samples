The GaussianMixture class initializes parameters multiple times when `n_init` is set, which can lead to different results each time. This is evident from the `fit_predict` method where multiple initialization runs are performed if `do_init` is True, which happens when `n_init` is specified. The issue lies in the fit-predict process not consistently aligning with the predict method across multiple initializations. The provided code spans include the initialization, fit, and predict methods, which are directly relevant to handling `n_init` and the subsequent steps leading to prediction outputs. This context reveals sections where the implementation could potentially be causing the reported discrepancies. Given the detailed analysis and alignment of the reported issue with the code spans provided, it is determined that the search results are relevant and cover key areas of interest.",

This suggests an issue in the initialization or parameter selection logic when multiple initializations are performed.

Notable spans include `BaseMixture.fit_predict`, which performs the actual fitting and prediction, and `BaseMixture.predict`, which is responsible for predicting based on fitted parameters. Additionally, the `GaussianMixture` class inherits these methods and potentially overrides or extends them, particularly the `_initialize`, `_m_step`, and `_estimate_log_prob` methods which play key roles in parameter initialization, update, and probability estimation, potentially contributing to the observed discrepancies when `n_init` is set.",
