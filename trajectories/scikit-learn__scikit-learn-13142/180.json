The relevant code spans should be focused on the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods within the `GaussianMixture` and its base class `BaseMixture`. The provided search results contain these methods, which are critical for addressing the issue. Specifically, the `fit_predict` method iterates over `n_init` times, potentially leading to different initialization each time, and this could be the root cause of the inconsistency. The `predict` method, on the other hand, does not perform this multiple initialization, leading to different results. Examining these methods in detail will help to pinpoint why the outputs differ when `n_init` is used and how to ensure consistent behavior or catch this in unit tests.
