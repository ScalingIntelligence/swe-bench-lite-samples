The current context provides relevant code spans from `base.py`, including `BaseMixture.fit_predict` and `BaseMixture.predict`. The new search results from `gaussian_mixture.py` provide additional relevant code spans, such as `GaussianMixture.__init__`, `GaussianMixture._check_parameters`, `GaussianMixture._initialize`, `GaussianMixture._m_step`, `GaussianMixture._estimate_log_prob`, and others, which are related to the initialization and estimation processes of GaussianMixture. Given the nature of the issue, it is crucial to inspect how these methods might differ when `n_init` is higher, potentially leading to different outcomes between `fit_predict` and `predict`. These code spans detail how parameters are initialized, updated, and validated, providing a comprehensive view of how the GaussianMixture model is structured and trained. By examining these spans, we can pinpoint the areas where the behavior might differ, especially when `n_init` is set to a value greater than 1. Overall, these code spans are relevant as they help understand how the model's internal states distribute and capture especially during reinitialization across different initializations when `n_init` is more than 1.",
