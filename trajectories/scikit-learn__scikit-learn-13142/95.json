The discrepancy is not caught by the existing unit test, `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict`, because it does not test with various `n_init` values. To address this issue, it's crucial to locate the relevant parts of the code where the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods are defined and implemented within the GaussianMixture class. This will help in understanding what aspects need to be adjusted to enforce consistency between the two methods despite varying `n_init` settings. Additionally, the unit test itself also needs to be adjusted to include the `n_init` parameter scenario, ensuring this edge case is covered.",
