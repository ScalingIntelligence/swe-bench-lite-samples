To address this, we need to examine the implementation of these methods and ensure they behave consistently regardless of the value of `n_init`. From the provided search results, we can see implementations of the `__init__`, `fit_predict`, and `predict` methods in the GaussianMixture class and its parent BaseMixture class. The `fit_predict` method involves an initialization process and iterative updates to model parameters, which may not reinitialize when `warm_start` is True. This could explain the discrepancy when `n_init` is set. The `predict` method, on the other hand, directly uses the trained parameters to estimate the log probabilities and predict the labels. These methods are central to resolving the issue as they directly relate to the reported problem of inconsistent predictions. Further inspection of these methods to ensure consistency across different initialization runs is warranted.",
