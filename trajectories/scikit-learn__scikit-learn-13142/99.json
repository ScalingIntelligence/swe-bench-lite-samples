The __init__ method in GaussianMixture sets the n_init parameter, which is crucial for understanding initialization behavior.\n2. The _initialize method initializes parameters based on the data and response variables (resp), potentially differing based on n_init.\n3.

From the search results, I see that the `GaussianMixture` class has several relevant methods: `__init__`, `_initialize`, `_estimate_log_prob`, `_estimate_log_weights`, `_compute_lower_bound`, `_check_is_fitted`, `_get_parameters`, and `_set_parameters`. Additionally, the `BaseMixture` class contains `fit_predict` and `predict`, which are directly related to the issue. To address the problem, it's important to ensure consistency in the initialization process when `n_init > 1`. The relevant code spans involving these methods and their interactions will be crucial for understanding and resolving the issue. Thus, both `GaussianMixture` and `BaseMixture` classes from the search results will be examined for related code spans.",
