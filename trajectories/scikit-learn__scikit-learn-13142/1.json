This adjustment addresses the issue by ensuring that after multiple initializations (`n_init > 1`), the model parameters that yield the highest lower bound are consistently applied. This should resolve the discrepancy between `fit_predict` and `predict` that arises when `n_init` is greater than 1. Given that the change has been applied and appears to be correctly addressing the issue, the task can now be considered complete.",
