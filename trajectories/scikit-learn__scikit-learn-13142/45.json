This issue could be related to how the model initialization and reinitialization with different `n_init` settings affect the clustering results. The search results provide methods from the GaussianMixture class and utility functions that are relevant to the initialization, fitting, and prediction processes. Key functions like `_initialize`, `_m_step`, and `_estimate_log_prob` are directly involved in these processes, and understanding their interplay could help resolve the issue. Additionally, functions like `_check_parameters` and `_compute_precision_cholesky` are crucial for parameter validation and setting up the model's precision matrices, which could also contribute to the observed discrepancies. The provided context and search results together enable a comprehensive view of the codebase involved in handling `GaussianMixture` model fitting and prediction, aiding in the identification of the root cause and potential solutions.",
