To address this, we need to examine the code related to these methods in the `GaussianMixture` class and its base class `BaseMixture`. The search results provide the relevant code spans for the `GaussianMixture` class, including its constructor and its inheritance from `BaseMixture`. In `BaseMixture`, we find the implementations of `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. The `fit_predict` method involves an initialization step, an expectation-maximization (EM) step, and a convergence check. The `predict` method simply returns the labels predicted by the model. These spans of code are directly related to the issue because they show how the fit and predict processes are handled. The issue likely arises due to differences in initialization and iteration handling when `n_init` is greater than 1.",

Each initialization involves an initialization of parameters followed by an EM iteration loop. The `_e_step` method computes log probabilities and responsibilities, while the `_m_step` method updates the model parameters based on these responsibilities. It is crucial to investigate how these steps are influenced by multiple initializations to understand the discrepancy between `fit_predict` and `predict`. Additionally, the initialization logic in the `GaussianMixture` class should be reviewed, particularly how the `n_init` parameter affects the start of the EM process.",
