The `n_init` parameter influences how many times the initialization should be performed with different initial parameters, retaining the best fitting model based on the likelihood. To further investigate potential issues with `n_init`, it would be beneficial to look into methods that are directly or indirectly involved in the initialization and parameter estimation cycle. The `_initialize_parameters` method, which is called during each initialization cycle, and the `_m_step` method, which updates the model parameters, are of particular interest.

This reflects adjusting the likelihood of finding a global optimum of the algorithm through the number of initializations. The `BaseMixture` class's method `fit_predict` reveals the critical components of determining clusters. It reiterates the use of `_initialize_parameters` and `_m_step` during the process. The presence of these methods bolsters the initial search parameters wherein the failure to find matching initializations and estimates suggests deeper tracing within the mentioned methods or perhaps considering other influencing factors within the ecosystem that aren't immediately visible.
