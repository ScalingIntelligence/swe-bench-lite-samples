This suggests a potential issue in the initialization or the iterative process of fitting the model. The search results provide relevant insights into the `GaussianMixture` class, its initialization parameters, and the internal method `_initialize` which is crucial for the initialization of the model. The `_initialize` method is sensitive to the `n_init` parameter and could be the source of the discrepancy. Further, the `_compute_precision_cholesky` method, which computes the Cholesky decomposition of the precision matrices, is also relevant as it is used in the initialization and could contribute to the differences observed in the results when `n_init` is high.

This discrepancy is not caught by the existing unit test `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` because it does not set `n_init`. To address this, we need to look at how `n_init` affects the initialization and iterative process in both `fit_predict` and `predict` methods. \n\nIn the `GaussianMixture` class, the `_initialize` method handles the initialization. The `_m_step` method updates the model parameters in each iteration. Both of these methods are crucial for understanding how `n_init` impacts the model's behavior. \n\nIn the `BaseMixture` class, the `fit_predict` method performs the EM algorithm, which involves an E-step and an M-step. The E-step computes the responsibility of each component for each data point, and the M-step updates the component parameters. The `predict` method estimates the log probabilities of each data point for each component and assigns the component with the highest log probability. \n\nThe search results show relevant code spans in `BaseMixture` related to `fit_predict` and `predict`. The `fit_predict` method includes the EM algorithm's iterations and checks for convergence, while the `predict` method estimates and selects the most likely component for each data point. These code spans are relevant to the reported issue because they involve the core logic that can cause discrepancies when `n_init` is greater than 1.",
