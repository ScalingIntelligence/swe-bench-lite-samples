This suggests that there might be an issue with how the fitting process and prediction process handle the initialization. The provided search results include relevant code spans in `sklearn/mixture/base.py` that define the `BaseMixture` class, which is likely the base class for `GaussianMixture`. Two key methods identified are `fit_predict` and `predict`, which directly relate to the issue. The `fit_predict` method initializes parameters, performs the expectation-maximization steps, and computes the lower bound, while the `predict` method simply checks if the model is fitted and then estimates the weighted log probabilities. Additionally, the `n_init` parameter is part of the initialization of `BaseMixture`, suggesting that this parameter plays a crucial role in the discrepancy mentioned. The unit test `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` is also mentioned, but there is no code span provided for it in the search results. Since the focus is on the `GaussianMixture` class and its methods, the search results and the existing context cover the aspects directly related to the reported issue.",
