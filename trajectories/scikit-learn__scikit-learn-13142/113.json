The reported issue highlights a discrepancy between `fit_predict` and `predict` methods when multiple initializations are specified. The relevant files to inspect are `gaussian_mixture.py` and `base.py`. The `fit_predict` method in `BaseMixture` and the methods like `fit`, `_initialize`, `_m_step`, and `predict` in `GaussianMixture` are all central to the process, as they handle the model training and prediction tasks. Given the complexity, it's crucial to inspect how the multiple initializations (`n_init`) affect the model parameters such as `weights_`, `means_`, and `covariances_`, and how these are then used in the prediction phase. The code also deals with precision matrices and their computation, which are key components in the prediction formula of Gaussian mixture models.",
