This suggests a potential problem in the initialization logic or the way predictions are generated after fitting. Relevant code spans are likely in the GaussianMixture class and its associated methods. The `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` unit test is also relevant but insufficiently checks the behavior with `n_init` set. To resolve this, it's crucial to identify the specific part of the GaussianMixture class where `n_init` is handled and see how fit_predict and predict methods differ in their implementation.",

It also contains the `predict` method, which predicts the labels based on the already fitted model.

I will analyze the provided code spans to identify relevant portions. The existing files and code spans in the context already cover the initialization, fitting, and prediction methods of GaussianMixture. The new search results provide additional methods like `_estimate_gaussian_parameters`, `_check_parameters`, `_m_step`, `_estimate_log_prob`, `_estimate_log_weights`, `_compute_lower_bound`, `_check_is_fitted`, `_get_parameters`, `_set_parameters`, and `_n_parameters`, which are all part of the GaussianMixture class and appear to be relevant to the issue due to their involvement in parameter estimation and model fitting. Since the issue involves the behavior of `fit_predict` and `predict` under certain conditions, all these methods are likely relevant, especially `_m_step`, which updates model parameters, and `_check_parameters`, which validates the model parameters. The codebase seems comprehensive for addressing the issue.",
