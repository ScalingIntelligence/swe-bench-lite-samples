The example provided demonstrates that the shape of the resulting matrix from hstacking zero matrices has changed. To investigate this, I need to find the implementation and any changes to the hstack method in sympy 1.1. Given the files listed, it appears that the hstack method is likely defined in sympy/matrices/common.py or potentially in other files related to matrix operations. I will start by searching for the hstack method in sympy/matrices/common.py.",
