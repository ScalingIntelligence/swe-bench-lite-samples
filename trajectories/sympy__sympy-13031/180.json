The expected output for horizontal stacking of matrices with zero rows was (0, 6) in SymPy 1.0, but it changed to (0, 3) in SymPy 1.1. The 'hstack' method is responsible for horizontally concatenating matrices. The search results provide the implementation of the 'hstack' method in the MatrixShaping class within 'sympy/matrices/common.py'. The method uses the 'reduce' function with 'row_join' to concatenate the matrices. This method seems to be directly related to the issue.

The specific issue is that hstacking matrices of zeros with different column counts results in different shapes in the two versions. In SymPy 1.0, hstacking matrices of shapes (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3) yields a shape of (0, 6), but in SymPy 1.1, it yields (0, 3). The current context provided focus on the `MatrixShaping` class and its `hstack` method. The new search results include additional methods such as `row_join`, `diag`, `eye`, `ones`, `zeros`, and others within the `MatrixShaping` and `MatrixSpecial` classes. The `row_join` method is particularly relevant as it is used within `hstack` and may directly impact the stacking behavior and result in different shapes depending on how it handles zero-sized matrices.",
