Specifically, it highlights that the hstack method now returns a shape of (0, 3) instead of (0, 6) when stacking zero-dimension matrices. Given this, the relevant code spans should include the definitions of hstack and perhaps vstack methods, as well as any related internal methods (like _eval_col_join or _eval_row_join) used in concatenation operations. The provided search results do include spans for both hstack and vstack class methods, as well as for internal methods like _eval_col_join and _eval_row_join, which are directly involved in the concatenation operations described in the issue. These spans should be sufficient to understand and potentially address the behavior change mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the shape property of the matrices could be relevant, which is also available in the search results, though it appears to be a straightforward property returning the dimensions of the matrix. Therefore, the search task is complete with the identification of these spans.",
