The expected and actual outputs for 'hstack' of zero-sized matrices differ, indicating a potential bug or a change in handling such cases.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found within the 'MatrixShaping' class, particularly within the 'hstack' method. This method is designed to horizontally stack matrices. The method checks if there are no arguments and returns a new matrix instance; otherwise, it uses the 'reduce' function with 'row_join' to merge the matrices. This is directly related to the functionality being tested in the reported issue.\n\nGiven the alignment between the code and the issue, I have identified the specific part of the code that handles the 'hstack' functionality, which should be further investigated for the behavior change observed.",
