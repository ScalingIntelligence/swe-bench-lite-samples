Specifically, the issue highlights that `hstack` no longer correctly calculates the shape of the resulting matrix when one or more of the input matrices have zero rows. In sympy 1.0, the `hstack` method combined matrices with zero rows into a matrix with a shape equal to the sum of their columns; in sympy 1.1, the shape is reduced to the sum of the columns of the non-empty matrices. This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the code responsible for handling the stacking of matrices horizontally. From the search results, it appears that the relevant code for `hstack` is located within the `MatrixShaping` class in the `sympy/matrices/common.py` file. The method `hstack` needs to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to handle the case where matrices with zero rows are input. Further investigation may be required to understand how the `reduce` function and `row_join` method interact with these cases.",

In sympy 1.0, stacking zero-sized matrices horizontally resulted in a matrix with a column size equal to the sum of all input matrices' column sizes. However, in sympy 1.1, the behavior changed, and the result only includes the sizes of non-empty matrices, ignoring zero-sized ones. This is likely due to the `reduce` function used in the hstack method, which starts from the first argument and applies the `row_join` method.
