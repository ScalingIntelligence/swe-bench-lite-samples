Additionally, the NewMatrix class in the linearsolver.py file may also be relevant.

The key information is that in sympy 1.0, stacking zero-sized matrices with hstack resulted in a matrix of shape (0, 6), whereas in sympy 1.1, the same operation results in a matrix of shape (0, 3). This suggests a change in the logic of how hstack handles zero-sized matrices.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'MatrixShaping' class within 'sympy/matrices/common.py'. Specifically, the 'hstack' method in this class is identified as relevant because it directly corresponds to the functionality under discussion. The method's logic shows how matrices are horizontally stacked using the 'row_join' function from the class. This method's behavior likely changed between versions, affecting the results observed in the reported issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the 'hstack' method and its logic are directly relevant to the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant for further investigation.",
