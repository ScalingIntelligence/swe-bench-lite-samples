The example provided demonstrates that combining matrices of zero rows in sympy 1.0 resulted in a matrix with a shape that accounted for all columns, whereas in sympy 1.1, the shape only accounts for non-zero columns. The search results provide the relevant code for the hstack and vstack methods within the MatrixShaping class in the matrices/common.py file. The hstack method uses the reduce function with row_join to horizontally stack the matrices, and similarly, the vstack method uses reduce with col_join for vertical stacking. These methods are directly linked to the issue as they are responsible for the stacking operations that are being discussed as changed in behavior. Therefore, the code spans for both hstack and vstack methods are relevant to the reported issue.",
