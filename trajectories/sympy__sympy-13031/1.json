The provided search results include a section of the sympy/matrices/common.py file which contains the implementation of these methods. The issue states that the shape of the matrix returned by 'hstack' has changed in sympy 1.1, which suggests that this change might be connected to the 'hstack' method implementation within the code span labeled 'MatrixShaping.hstack'. It's noted that the 'MatrixShaping' class and its methods are responsible for horizontal and vertical stacking of matrices. Therefore, this code span is directly relevant to the reported issue, as it involves the functionality that has changed. Also, considering that 'vstack' is mentioned in the issue even though it hasn't shown any behavior change, it's prudent to check the method's code to ensure there isn't any other underlying issue. So, both 'hstack' and 'vstack' method implementations within the 'MatrixShaping' class are identified as relevant.",
