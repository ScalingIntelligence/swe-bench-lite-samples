Given this, the focus should be on the `hstack` method within the `MatrixShaping` class in the provided search results. This method is the one that is specifically mentioned and affected by the issue. By examining the `MatrixShaping.hstack` span ID, it appears to contain the relevant code responsible for horizontally stacking matrices, which aligns directly with the key elements of the reported issue.
