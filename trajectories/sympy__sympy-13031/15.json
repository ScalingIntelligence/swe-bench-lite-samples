In sympy 1.0, `hstack` of zero-sized matrices resulted in a matrix with a width equal to the sum of their widths. In sympy 1.1, the width is not the sum but seems to be influenced by other factors. The relevant code spans are identified in the `MatrixShaping` class where the `hstack` and `vstack` methods are defined. These methods use the `reduce` function with `row_join` and `col_join` respectively to perform the stacking operations. These code spans are likely relevant to investigate why the behavior has changed.",
