In sympy 1.0, stacking matrices of sizes `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(0, 2)`, and `(0, 3)` resulted in a matrix of shape `(0, 6)`, whereas in sympy 1.1, the same operation results in a matrix of shape `(0, 3)`. This difference suggests a change in the logic that handles matrix stacking for matrices with zero rows. The current file context and search results focus on the `MatrixShaping` class within the `common.py` file, which contains methods related to matrix shaping and joining, including `hstack` and `row_join`. From the provided search results, it is evident that the `row_join` method plays a critical role in the `hstack` method's functionality. The `row_join` method handles joining of matrices row-wise and contains specific conditions for joining matrices with zero columns.
