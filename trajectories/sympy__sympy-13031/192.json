The hstack method implementation is particularly relevant as it directly relates to the issue reported. The method uses the reduce function with the row_join operation to concatenate matrices horizontally. This implementation could be the source of the behavior change observed in the reported issue. Identifying the exact code span responsible for the behavior change would require a deeper analysis of the code and the changes made between sympy 1.0 and 1.1, but for now, focusing on the hstack method within the MatrixShaping class is the most relevant starting point.",
