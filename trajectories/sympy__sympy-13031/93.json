The issue is with the `hstack` method in `MatrixShaping` class, specifically how the shape of the resultant matrix is calculated when stacking zero-sized matrices. The expected behavior in sympy 1.0 and the actual behavior in sympy 1.1 differs. The key elements to look for in the search results are the `hstack` method and related methods such as `_eval_row_join` and `row_join` that might be contributing to this behavior change.\n\nFrom the search results, I examined the `MatrixShaping` class to find relevant spans that could impact the behavior of `hstack`. This includes reviewing methods like `_eval_col_join`, `_eval_row_join`, `col_join`, and `row_join`. The spans `MatrixShaping._eval_row_join`, `MatrixShaping.row_join`, and `MatrixShaping.hstack` are particularly relevant as they are directly involved in the stacking operations of matrices. After examining these spans, I conclude that the provided code segments directly relate to the reported issue by addressing the stacking of matrices and shape calculations, thus forming a likely basis for understanding or addressing the issue in sympy 1.1.",
