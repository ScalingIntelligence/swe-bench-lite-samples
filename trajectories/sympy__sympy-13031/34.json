Specifically, the output shape of `hstack` with zero-sized matrices has changed, which is important for users who rely on this method for matrix concatenation. In sympy 1.0, `hstack` of zero-sized matrices resulted in a matrix with a certain shape, whereas in sympy 1.1, the shape is different. This change might affect current implementations that depend on the old behavior.\n\nLooking at the provided search results, the relevant code is found in the `MatrixShaping` class within the `sympy/matrices/common.py` file. Within this class, the `hstack` method is defined. It's crucial to review the implementation of `hstack` to understand why the behavior has changed. The method uses `reduce` with `row_join` to join matrices horizontally. The change in behavior might be due to updates in how `row_join` handles zero-sized matrices or an intentional update in the `hstack` logic.\n\nThe identified code contains the `hstack` method implementation, which is directly related to the reported issue. Therefore, it's appropriate to identify the spans where the `hstack` method is defined and implemented.",
