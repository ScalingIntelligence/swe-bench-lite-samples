Specifically, the issue notes that the hstack method now inconsistently computes the shape of the resulting matrix when concatenating matrices with zero rows, which could lead to incorrect results in dependent code. This suggests that the hstack method or related methods like row_join might have undergone changes that need to be investigated. By examining the provided search results, particularly the MatrixShaping class and its hstack and row_join methods, it appears that these methods directly relate to the reported issue. The row_join method in particular contains logic that could affect how matrices of different shapes are joined, which could explain the change in behavior observed in sympy 1.1. Additionally, the SparseMatrix class in sparse.py also has a row_join method that could influence the behavior of hstack for sparse matrices. Therefore, both the hstack and row_join methods in the MatrixShaping class and the row_join method in the SparseMatrix class are identified as relevant code spans needed to understand and potentially address the issue.",

The focus seems to be on how zero-sized matrices are handled during horizontal stacking. The provided code spans show the implementation of these methods in both `MatrixShaping` and `MutableSparseMatrix` classes. The `MatrixShaping.hstack` method uses `reduce` with `row_join` to stack matrices horizontally, and the `MatrixShaping.row_join` method handles the joining of rows, including specific handling of zero-sized matrices. The `MutableSparseMatrix.row_join` method in the sparse matrix implementation also deals with joining rows, including handling of non-sparse matrices.
