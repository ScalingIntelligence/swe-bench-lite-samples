The behavior in version 1.1 is inconsistent with version 1.0, particularly when stacking zero-sized matrices. The search results include the `MatrixShaping` class which contains the definitions of `hstack` and `vstack` methods. The `hstack` method uses the `row_join` function and similarly, `vstack` uses `col_join`. These methods are likely where the changes in behavior occurred. It's important to inspect these methods to understand how they handle zero-sized matrices in version 1.1 and to compare it with the behavior in version 1.0 to determine the root cause of the issue.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns changes in the behavior of `hstack` and `vstack` methods in the `sympy` library between versions 1.0 and 1.1. Specifically, the behavior of `hstack` when stacking zero-sized matrices has changed. In SymPy 1.0, stacking zero-sized matrices results in a matrix with combined columns, whereas in SymPy 1.1, the result is a matrix with the number of columns equal to the last matrix in the stack. The file context already provided relevant spans showcasing the `hstack` and `row_join` methods. Now, examining the new search results, it's evident that the `hstack` and `row_join` methods are again found within the `MatrixShaping` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py`. The `row_join` method is crucial as it is used internally by `hstack`. Additionally, the `row_join` method checks the number of rows between matrices and joins them row-wise. The new search results also include supplementary methods like `_eval_row_join`, which is directly called by `row_join`, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of the code's logic. These methods and their evaluation counterparts are critical for understanding how `hstack` works and how it might have changed between versions. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete as all relevant code spans have been identified and analyzed.",

In such a case, it returns a new matrix with the same number of rows as `other` but with 0 columns, and then proceeds to join this matrix with `other`. This differs from the regular case where a ShapeError would be raised if the number of rows did not match. This handling may explain the change in behavior observed in the `hstack` method when dealing with empty matrices. Further investigation should be done to determine if this handling was changed deliberately in sympy 1.1 and what the reasoning behind it was.",
