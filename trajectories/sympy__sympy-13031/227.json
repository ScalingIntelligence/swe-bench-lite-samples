The focus seems to be on the `hstack` method handling of zero-sized matrices. The current context includes the `MatrixShaping` class and its `hstack` method in `sympy/matrices/common.py`. The search results show additional implementations of the `row_join` method in `sympy/matrices/common.py`, `sympy/holonomic/linearsolver.py`, and `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`. These `row_join` methods are crucial as they are used within the `hstack` method for the actual concatenation of matrices. The relevance of each `row_join` implementation needs to be evaluated based on how they handle zero-sized matrices and matrix shape checks, as these issues could directly impact the behavior observed in the reported issue. The `SparseMatrix` and `MutableSparseMatrix` classes in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py` also implement the `row_join` method, which must be considered for the potential impact on matrix stacking operations involving sparse matrices. The evaluation of these methods' handling of zero-sized matrices against the observed behavior in versions 1.0 and 1.1 will help determine the specific code spans relevant to addressing the issue.",

Specifically, there is a difference in the shape of the resulting matrix when using hstack with zero-size matrices between sympy 1.0 and sympy 1.1. This discrepancy could be due to modifications in the hstack or row_join methods. The existing identified spans in sympy/matrices/common.py include 'MatrixShaping.hstack' and 'MatrixShaping.row_join', which are relevant to this issue. The new search results also contain the 'MatrixShaping.hstack' and 'MatrixShaping.row_join' spans, which remain relevant and confirm the initial suspicions. Additional spans such as 'Poly._from_dict', 'Poly._from_expr', and 'GroebnerBasis.reduce' in sympy/polys/polytools.py seem unrelated to the matrix operations in question. The spans in sympy/series/sequences.py, such as 'SeqAdd', 'SeqAdd.__new__', 'SeqAdd.reduce', 'SeqMul', and 'SeqMul.reduce', also appear to be unrelated to matrix operations.
