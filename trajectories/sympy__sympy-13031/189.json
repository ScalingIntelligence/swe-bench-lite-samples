In sympy 1.0, `hstack` of zero-dimension matrices returned a matrix with a shape corresponding to the sum of all columns, while in sympy 1.1, it returns a shape corresponding only to the nonzero-dimension matrices. This suggests an alteration in the logic for handling zero-dimension matrices within the `hstack` method or its dependencies. The provided file context includes the `MatrixShaping` class with the `hstack` method, which utilizes the `row_join` method to join matrices horizontally. The new search results show the `MatrixShaping.row_join` method, which seems to have logic specifically for handling cases where the first matrix has zero columns. This direct relevance to the issue suggests that changes within the `row_join` method likely impacted the `hstack` behavior. Therefore, both the `hstack` and `row_join` methods are crucial for addressing the reported issue, as they provide the underlying logic for the behavior observed.",

The provided context suggests that the `row_join` method in the `MatrixShaping` class might be causing this issue. The current handling of zero-sized matrices in `row_join` when the number of rows differs does not match the expected behavior observed in sympy 1.0. Therefore, the appropriate action is to adjust the `row_join` method to ensure that it behaves consistently with the results from sympy 1.0.",
