The change involves the shape of the resulting matrix after stacking zero matrices. It's crucial to investigate the implementation of the hstack and vstack methods in the sympy codebase to understand how this behavior changed. Relevant files seem to include those handling matrix operations, such as 'common.py', 'matrices.py', and 'sparse.py'. The 'common.py' file contains the definition of the hstack and vstack class methods, making it a primary candidate for inspection. The 'sparse.py' file is also relevant as it defines methods for sparse matrices, which could influence the stacking behavior. The 'matrices.py' file, which is more general, might also affect the stacking behavior due to inherent matrix properties.",

The example provided demonstrates that stacking matrices with certain shapes results in different output shapes in the two versions. The search results contain the implementation of the `hstack` and `vstack` methods within the `MatrixShaping` class. These methods are directly relevant to the issue as they detail the logic used to stack matrices horizontally and vertically. Specifically, the `hstack` method uses the `row_join` function to concatenate matrices horizontally. This method is likely where the change in behavior occurred, making the 'MatrixShaping.hstack' span particularly relevant for further investigation or potential modification to address the reported behavior change.",

In sympy 1.0, `sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape` returns `(0, 6)` where M1, M2, M3, M4 are all non-zero-size matrices. However, in sympy 1.1, it returns `(0, 3)`. The issue also notes that when the matrices have non-zero rows, the behavior remains consistent between versions.\n\nTo address this issue, the relevant code spans should include the implementation of `Matrix.hstack` and other related methods like `row_join`, as the behavior change might be due to the reevaluation or differences in how `row_join` handles zero-sized matrices. From the provided `file_context`, the relevant code span is contained within `MatrixShaping` class under the `MatrixShaping.hstack` and `MatrixShaping.row_join` spans. In addition, the new search results reinforce this, as they contain extensive coverage of the `MatrixShaping` class, particularly the `hstack` method which is central to the issue reported.\n\nThe reconsideration of the search results revealed crucial methods like `_eval_row_join` and `classof` which determine the row joining mechanism and class compatibility respectively, influencing the behavior of `hstack`. The issue seems to be related to how zero-size matrices are handled in these methods, which would require a code adjustment likely within `_eval_row_join` and perhaps `classof` as well.\n\nGiven this detailed analysis, the identified spans cover the relevant methods and are likely sufficient for addressing the reported issue.",
