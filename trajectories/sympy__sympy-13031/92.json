In sympy 1.0, stacking matrices with zeros along the columns resulted in a larger matrix (0, 6) but in version 1.1, it returns (0, 3). The primary focus of the search is to identify the code spans responsible for this behavior change, specifically in the methods `hstack` and `row_join` in the context of matrix shaping and joining. From the initial file context, we have the definition of `hstack` in the `MatrixShaping` class and need to check if changes in `hstack` involve direct modifications or alterations in helper functions like `row_join`. The search results provide deeper context into `row_join`, revealing how the method deals with joining rows of different matrices.

The relevance of each code span is established based on how the issue's problem statement maps directly onto the functionality of `hstack` and `row_join`.

The key is to identify the relevant code span in sympy 1.1 that controls the behavior of hstack and vstack to understand why the change occurred. We have already identified the relevant files and spans in the initial context, including the MatrixShaping class and its hstack and row_join methods. The search results provided contain additional relevant spans in the immutable and sparse matrices, and in the common and dense matrices files. Notably, the ImmutableSparseMatrix and MutableSparseMatrix classes have _new methods, which could influence the behavior of matrix shaping operations. These should be examined to ensure they comport with the expected behavior of hstack according to the reported issue. The analysis of these spans will help us determine the specific location of the code that led to the change in hstack's behavior.",
