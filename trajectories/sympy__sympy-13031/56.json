Specifically, the issue highlights that stacking zero-sized matrices in sympy 1.1 results in a different shape compared to sympy 1.0.\n\n2. Review Current Context: No relevant code has been identified yet, indicating this is the first analysis of the provided search results.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n  3.1. Identified the `MatrixShaping` class and the `hstack` method within it.\n  3.2. Noticed that `hstack` is a class method that uses `reduce` with `row_join` to horizontally stack matrices.\n  3.3. The method checks if no arguments are provided and returns a new matrix if so.\n  3.4. Since the issue involves zero-sized matrices, focused on the `hstack` method as it directly pertains to stacking matrices.\n  3.5. Assessed the entire section of code to ensure understanding of how `hstack` processes its arguments.\n  3.6. No references to other parts of the codebase that are relevent were found in the search results.\n  3.7. Identified the `hstack` method within the `MatrixShaping` class as relevant to the reported issue.\n\n4. Respond Using the Function: Determined that the `hstack` method is relevant to the reported issue concerning the change in behavior of matrix stacking in sympy 1.1.",
