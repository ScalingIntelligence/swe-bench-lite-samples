            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a change in the behavior of the `hstack` method in SymPy between versions 1.0 and 1.1. Specifically, when stacking zero-dimension matrices, the number of columns differs. In SymPy 1.0, stacking zero-dimension matrices results in a matrix with a total number of columns equivalent to the sum of all individual matrices' columns. In SymPy 1.1, this results in a matrix with fewer columns. The task is to identify the point in the code where this behavior change occurred. \n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, the relevant classes and methods are: `MatrixShaping` class and its `hstack` method in `sympy/matrices/common.py`. Additionally, the `row_join` method in the same class, which is used by `hstack`, is also crucial since the behavior of `hstack` is dependent on how `row_join` interacts with zero-dimension matrices. \n\nIn the search results, another `row_join` method within the `MutableSparseMatrix` class in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py` is provided. This could also be relevant to the investigation if the `hstack` or `row_join` methods in `SparseMatrix` have different behavior compared to the general `Matrix` class. It's important to note that the behavior might differ when dealing with sparse matrices, impacting the overall stacking logic. \n\nGiven these observations, it's likely that the behavior change might be localized within the `row_join` or `hstack` methods. The `row_join` method in the `SparseMatrix` class might contain specific logic that handles zero-dimensional matrices differently, which could be the cause for the observed change in behavior. Therefore, further investigation into these methods to understand how zero-dimensional matrices are handled would be beneficial.",

The current file context and search results show relevant code spans that could be related to how the hstack and row_join methods work. The focus should be on the hstack and row_join methods in the 'MatrixShaping' class and similar methods in the 'MutableSparseMatrix' class. However, while the context provides some insight, it does not cover the entire logic related to the reported issue. The search results, too, do not provide additional or missing code that could be critical to understanding the behavior before and after the change.

Given that the code already demonstrates careful checks on matrix dimensions and handling of zero-dimension matrices before concatenation, it seems like a complete understanding of the `hstack` functionality's implementation in the given context is possible.
