To investigate this, we should focus our search on files and code related to matrix stacking operations. The provided code snippets and the issue description both use the Matrix.hstack method, so we should prioritize searching for this method and its implementations. Given the context provided, it's clear that the hstack method is likely defined or used in the `common.py` and `sparse.py` files within the sympy/matrices directory, as these files contain classes and methods related to matrix operations like stacking. Additionally, the `linearsolver.py` file also has a col_join method which might be related to how column (or horizontal) stacking is handled internally. Therefore, I recommend searching in these specific files for the hstack method and any related logic that might have changed between versions.",
