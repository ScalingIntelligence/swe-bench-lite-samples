The search should focus on the sympy/matrices module, particularly on the parts where `hstack` is defined and used. Given the context provided, one relevant file could be `sympy/matrices/common.py` which contains the `MatrixShaping` class, possibly affecting `hstack`. Additionally, since it involves matrix operations, we could also consider files like `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py` as they may have code directly related to stacking operations or matrix multiplication issues. Since `hstack` and `vstack` methods are explicitly mentioned in the issue, focusing on these methods in the given files should help locate the root cause of the behavior change.",
