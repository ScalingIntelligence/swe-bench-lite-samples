Specifically, the issue is about the shape of the resulting matrix after applying hstack to matrices of zeros with differing dimensions. In sympy 1.0, stacking zero-dimensional matrices with non-zero-dimensional matrices resulted in matrices whose shape included sums of column dimensions. However, in sympy 1.1, this behavior has changed, and the resulting matrix's shape now depends on the matrices' dimensions in a different way. From the search results, we can see that the relevant code spans are within the 'MatrixShaping' class, specifically the 'hstack' and 'vstack' methods. These methods are responsible for horizontally and vertically stacking matrices, respectively, and any changes in their implementation or logic could directly relate to the reported issue. Therefore, these methods are identified as relevant to further investigate the behavior change.",

In sympy 1.0, `hstack` with specific matrices returns a shape of (0, 6), while in sympy 1.1, it returns a shape of (0, 3). The current file context already contains relevant code spans for `MatrixShaping`, which includes the `hstack` and `vstack` methods. Reviewing the new search results, which are the same as the context, confirms that the `hstack` method, which concatenates matrices horizontally, is indeed defined. Given the focus of the issue is on the change in behavior of `hstack`, the relevant code span is the `hstack` method within the `MatrixShaping` class.
