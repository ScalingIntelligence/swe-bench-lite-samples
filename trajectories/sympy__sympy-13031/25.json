The methods use the 'reduce' function with 'row_join' and 'col_join' respectively, which is likely where the behavior change might be occurring.

Upon examining the new search results, it is confirmed that these code spans are indeed where the issue lies. The `hstack` method is particularly important as it directly involves the stacking of matrices horizontally, which is the core functionality being discussed. The provided code spans adequately cover the relevant parts of the codebase that need to be investigated to understand the behavior change and potentially address it.
