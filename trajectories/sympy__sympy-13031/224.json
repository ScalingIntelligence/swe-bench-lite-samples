The behavior change likely involves modifications in the `hstack` method itself or related methods such as `_eval_col_join`, `row_join`, or `col_join`. Focusing on these methods in the context of zero-sized matrices should be the priority.

The key concern is how `hstack` handles matrices of different shapes, particularly when some matrices have zero rows. The current file context and search results both point to methods related to matrix stacking, specifically `_eval_row_join`, `hstack`, and `row_join`. These methods are critical for understanding how horizontal stacking (`hstack`) is implemented. The `hstack` method uses `row_join` to concatenate the matrices horizontally, and it checks for compatibility in the number of rows. The change in behavior might be due to the handling of zero-row matrices in `row_join` or in the reduction logic used in `hstack`. Therefore, these parts of the code are directly relevant to the reported issue. The `classof` method, used to determine the class type of the resulting matrix, might also play a role in the behavior change, but it seems more tangential to the main issue.",

Notably, `hstack` utilizes `row_join`, which further leverages `_eval_row_join` to concatenate matrices row-wise. The behavior concerning zero-sized matrices is partially covered in the `row_join` method, where it checks for mismatched row counts and instead attempts to join with a zero-column matrix of appropriate row count. However, the specific treatment of zero-sized matrices in earlier versions like sympy 1.0 isn't entirely clear from this code alone.
