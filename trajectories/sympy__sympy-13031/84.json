Since the issue is focused on `hstack`, the relevant code span is the implementation of `hstack` within the `MatrixShaping` class.\n\nThe `hstack` method uses `reduce` with `row_join` to concatenate matrices horizontally. This method likely underwent changes between versions that led to the observed behavior difference in the outputs.
