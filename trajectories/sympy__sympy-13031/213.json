The search results show the `MatrixShaping` class which contains the `hstack` method. This method is likely to be the one responsible for the change in behavior. The method `hstack` is a classmethod that uses `reduce` with `row_join` to join the matrices horizontally.

In sympy 1.0, `hstack` of matrices with zero rows returns a matrix with a shape of (0, n), where n is the sum of the number of columns in the matrices. However, in sympy 1.1, the shape is (0, m), where m is the number of non-empty matrices. This discrepancy needs to be investigated. The provided `MatrixShaping.hstack` method is the primary focus as it is the method under investigation. Relevant sections of the code involved in `hstack`, such as `MatrixShaping._eval_hstack` and related methods like `row_join` which is used within `hstack`, should be examined. Also, any changes in behavior based on matrix dimensions (especially around zero rows and columns) should be analyzed. The provided search results confirm my thoughts, showing relevant methods and classes such as `MatrixShaping`, `row_join`, and `hstack` in the context of matrix operations. These methods handle reshaping operations on matrices like 'hstack', including concatenating matrices horizontally. So, these sections are highly relevant to the reported issue.",

Specifically, the example provided shows that concatenating zero-sized matrices using `hstack` in sympy 1.1 results in a different shape compared to sympy 1.0. The task is to identify relevant code spans related to `hstack` and `row_join` methods in the provided codebase. By examining the search results, the `hstack` method involves calling `row_join` on the provided matrices. The `row_join` method is responsible for joining two matrices side by side. The search results show implementations of these methods in the `MatrixShaping` class and in `MutableSparseMatrix`. These implementations handle the concatenation logic that would relate to the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant spans to address the reported issue are those containing the `hstack` and `row_join` methods.",
