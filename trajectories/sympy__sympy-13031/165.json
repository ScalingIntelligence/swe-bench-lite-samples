The initial focus should be on the `MatrixShaping` class and the `MatrixBase` class, which both contain methods related to stacking operations like `hstack`. Additionally, looking at the `NewMatrix` class within the `linearsolver` module since it also has a `col_join` method that could be relevant. Furthermore, examining the `MatMul` and `MatAdd` classes within the `expressions` module since they deal with matrix multiplication and addition, which might indirectly influence the stacking operations. Given the listed files, specify the search primarily by class names (`MatrixShaping`, `MatrixBase`, `NewMatrix`, `MatMul`, `MatAdd`) and method names (`hstack`, `col_join`).",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue describes a change in the behavior of `hstack` and `vstack` methods in SymPy matrices between versions 1.0 and 1.1. Specifically, the issue focuses on the behavior of `hstack` when one or more of the input matrices have zero rows, which results in a difference in the output shape. Given this, I need to identify code spans that are relevant to the `hstack` method and its handling of zero-row matrices.\n\nIn the provided search results, there are two files containing relevant code. In `sympy/matrices/common.py`, the `MatrixShaping` class contains the `hstack` method. This method uses `reduce` with `row_join` to horizontally stack matrices. It checks if there are no arguments and returns an empty matrix; otherwise, it stacks using `row_join`. This behavior aligns with the reported issue since it could be related to how matrices with different shapes, especially those with zero rows, are handled in the stacking operation.\n\nThe other file, `sympy/holonomic/linearsolver.py`, contains a `col_join` method in the `NewMatrix` class. While not directly related to `hstack`, it deals with matrix joining and could indirectly impact stacking operations. However, its relevance to the issue is less direct.\n\nBased on this analysis, I choose to focus on the `hstack` method and its implementation in `sympy/matrices/common.py` as the most relevant to the reported issue. The `col_join` method in `sympy/holonomic/linearsolver.py` is also noted but considered less directly relevant.",
