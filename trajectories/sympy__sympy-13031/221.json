The example provided shows that stacking matrices with zero rows produces different results. In sympy 1.0, stacking matrices with zero rows and varying columns resulted in a matrix with the total number of columns. However, in sympy 1.1, this behavior changed, and the result is different. Reviewing the search results, we find the `hstack` method within the `MatrixShaping` class. This method is responsible for horizontal stacking of matrices and uses the `reduce` function with `row_join` to join the matrices. Based on the issue description, the change in behavior is likely related to the implementation of this method. Therefore, the method `hstack` in the `MatrixShaping` class is relevant to the reported issue.",
