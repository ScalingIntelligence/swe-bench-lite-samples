From the provided context, it is evident that the `hstack` method is defined in the `MatrixShaping` class within `sympy/matrices/common.py`. To understand the changes in behavior, we need to focus on the `hstack` method within this class or any related changes in the `common.py` module. Additionally, we should check if there are any relevant changes in the `sparse.py` module as `MutableSparseMatrix` also has `row_join` and `col_join` methods that might affect stacking operations.",

The issue suggests that in sympy 1.1, the behavior of `hstack` differs when dealing with zero-sized matrices, particularly in terms of the resulting shape. This discrepancy could be due to changes in how zero-sized matrices are handled in the stacking operations.\n\nIn the provided search results, we find relevant code in `sympy/matrices/common.py` under the `MatrixShaping` class. Specifically, we identify several spans that are pertinent to this investigation:\n\n1. `MatrixShaping.hstack`: This class method is directly responsible for horizontal stacking of matrices. It uses `row_join` to combine matrices, and understanding how `row_join` treats zero-sized matrices is crucial.\n2. `MatrixShaping.row_join`: This method is used by `hstack` to perform the actual concatenation. The check for the number of rows being equal and the handling of zero-sized matrices here could be causing the change in behavior.\n\nGiven these spans, we can delve deeper into the specific implementations to identify where the handling of zero-sized matrices might have changed between versions. This will help us pinpoint the cause of the issue and potentially suggest a fix or clarification.\n\nNo relevant code was found in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py` that directly addresses the issue at hand, so we do not include any spans from that file in our identified spans.",

Specifically, the issue highlights that `hstack` of zero-row matrices in version 1.0 returns a matrix with a number of columns equal to the sum of the columns of all matrices, while in version 1.1, it returns a matrix with a number of columns equal to the number of non-zero column matrices. This suggests a check or change in the `hstack` or `row_join` methods. The provided context and search results both refer to the `MatrixShaping` class and specifically the `row_join` method. The method checks for the condition where the number of columns is zero and the number of rows is not equal, suggesting it might be relevant to fixing the issue described. However, the context includes a reference to the `hstack` method in addition to the `row_join` method, underscoring the importance of both methods in understanding and fixing the behavior change. Going through the `row_join` method, it appears to handle the case where the columns are zero differently compared to the original behavior, which might explain the difference in the outputs between sympy versions.
