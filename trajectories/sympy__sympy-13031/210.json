In sympy 1.0, stacking matrices with zero rows resulted in a matrix with a number of columns equal to the sum of the columns of all matrices. In sympy 1.1, the result is different, with the number of columns not summing up as expected. The search results focus on the `MatrixShaping` class which contains the implementations of `hstack` and `row_join` methods which are crucial for horizontal stacking. The `row_join` method is called within `hstack` and appears to handle the joining of matrices.
