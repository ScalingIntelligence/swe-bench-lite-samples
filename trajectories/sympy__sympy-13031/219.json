The `row_join` method is also present in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py` and `sympy/holonomic/linearsolver.py`. The behavior of `row_join` specifically with zero-sized matrices is addressed in `sympy/matrices/common.py` where it checks if `self.cols == 0` and handles it by creating a new matrix with zero columns and joining it with `other`. This indicates that the core logic for handling zero-sized matrices in `hstack` and `row_join` is found in the provided context. There is a possibility that the change in behavior from sympy 1.0 to 1.1 might be due to the specific handling of zero-sized matrices within these methods, which are all present in the provided file context.",
