Specifically, the hstack method behaves differently when handling matrices of zeros. To investigate this, we should focus on the hstack method implementation, which is likely to be found in a file related to matrix operations such as sympy/matrices/common.py, where the MatrixShaping class is defined. However, since no files have been found yet and the context provides a comprehensive list of files related to sympy's matrices, we should start by directly specifying the class method in question, which is `hstack` for the MatrixShaping class. This will help us pin down the exact location of the method that handles matrix horizontal stacking.",

The issue seems to center around how the hstack method calculates the shape of matrices when stacked horizontally. Specifically, the method's handling of zero-sized matrices appears to have been altered, leading to different outputs depending on the version of sympy. In sympy 1.0, hstack of zero-sized matrices results in a shape (0, 6), whereas in sympy 1.1, it results in a shape (0, 3). This indicates a potential bug or intentional change in the logic used by the hstack method. Given these details, it's evident that the relevant code span is the 'hstack' method definition within the MatrixShaping class in the sympy/matrices/common.py file. This method needs to be examined to understand why the behavior changed and to possibly revert or adjust its logic to align with expectations.",
