The example provided shows that in sympy 1.0, the shape of the matrix after horizontal stacking was (0, 6), while in sympy 1.1, it changed to (0, 3). The focus should be on understanding and identifying where the implementation of the hstack method in MatrixShaping class could have been modified to cause this change in behavior.\n\nThe search results provided include the relevant code spanning for hstack and vstack methods within the MatrixShaping class. By analyzing the provided code spans, it appears that the hstack method is implemented with a class method decorator and it uses the reduce function along with row_join for horizontal stacking. The implementation of vstack similarly uses reduce with col_join for vertical stacking. Since the issue is specifically about hstack, the attention should be directed towards the hstack method.\n\nGiven that the method's functionality changed in sympy 1.1, it's crucial to compare the code from version 1.0 with that in version 1.1 to identify the modifications causing the shape change for zero-dimension matrices. However, the search results present in version 1.1 suggest that the changes might be in how the reduce function or row_join is used, possibly ignoring or differently handling zero-dimension matrices.",
