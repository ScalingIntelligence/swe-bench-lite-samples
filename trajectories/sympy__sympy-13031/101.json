The current context points to the `MatrixShaping.hstack` method and its use of `row_join`. The new search results reveal the implementation of `MatrixShaping.row_join` in `common.py` and `MutableSparseMatrix.row_join` in `sparse.py`. Both methods deal with row joining, which is critical for understanding how `hstack` operates. The `row_join` method in `common.py` checks the rows' equality, potentially handling the zero-row matrices differently. The `row_join` in `sparse.py` also handles joining by checking if the matrices are empty or copying values from the other matrix, which may affect how zero-row matrices are treated in `hstack`.

The `row_join` method in `MatrixShaping` manages scenarios where the number of columns is zero and ensures matching rows between matrices, similar behavior is found in `MutableSparseMatrix`. Given the clear presence of these methods in the identified files, further investigation into version-specific changes is indicated via commit logs between sympy 1.0 and 1.1 to pinpoint the behavior change concerning zero-sized matrices and their concatenation behavior. The immediate step should involve reviewing these logs focusing on the detailed changes in `hstack` and `row_join` to deduce the cause of the observed behavior shift.",
