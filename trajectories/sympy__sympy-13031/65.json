The issue involves the `hstack` method, so I will focus on this part of the provided code first. I notice that the `MatrixShaping` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py` contains the `hstack` method. This is likely the area where changes to the behavior of `hstack` have been implemented. Examining this method, I can see a class method `hstack` which returns a new matrix by stacking other matrices horizontally side by side. Importantly, it uses the `reduce` function combined with `row_join` to accomplish this, which might be central to understanding the changed behavior regarding the shape of the resulting matrix. This section targets the functionality directly related to `hstack`. Since understanding the change in behavior primarily depends on this method, I believe the identified span in `MatrixShaping` is sufficient to start addressing the reported issue. Thus, I mark this span as relevant.",

The issue specifically mentions differences in the return shapes of the matrices when zero matrices of different shapes are horizontally stacked. The initial context provided the implementation of `hstack` in `MatrixShaping`, but further examination of `row_join` and other related methods is necessary to fully understand and address the problem. \\n\\nFrom the new search results, I found that the `MatrixShaping` class has implementations for `_eval_row_join`, `row_join`, and `hstack`, which are central to understanding the horizontal stacking behavior. Additionally, the `SparseMatrix` class in `sparse.py` has a `row_join` method that could also be relevant since it deals with the concatenation of rows, especially when considering sparse matrices. \\n\\nThe investigation should also consider the reduction logic in the `reduce` function from `sympy.core.compatibility` that is used in the `hstack` method, as it iterates over the provided matrices to concatenate them horizontally. The `classof` function in `common.py` is used to determine the class of the resulting matrix, which might be an aspect to consider if the behavior differs between different subtypes of matrices such as dense and sparse. \\n\\nOverall, the relevant spans to address the change in `hstack` behavior between versions of Sympy are those that implement `hstack`, `row_join`, `reduce`, and other aspects of horizontal matrix concatenation.",

Specifically, the `hstack` method on matrices of zero dimensions is returning different results. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the `hstack` method and its associated `row_join` method, as these are the likely places where the change in behavior could be occurring. The search results show that both `common.py` and `sparse.py` contain the implementations of these methods. In `common.py`, `hstack` is implemented as a class method, which internally uses `row_join`. The `row_join` method also appears in `common.py`, where it checks for shape compatibility and then calls `_eval_row_join`. Additionally, `sparse.py` contains an implementation of `row_join` specific to the `MutableSparseMatrix` class, which handles joining rows for sparse matrices. Both of these implementations need to be reviewed to understand the context and the change in behavior.",
