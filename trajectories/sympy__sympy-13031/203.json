The example provided shows that the shape of the matrix created using hstack with zero-sized matrices has changed. This suggests that the logic within the hstack method might have been modified between versions to produce the different outcomes. Given the current context and the search results, the relevant code spans are within the MatrixShaping class where the hstack method is defined. The hstack method itself is of particular interest as it directly deals with the stacking of matrices, which is the focus of the reported issue. The method's logic using 'reduce' and 'row_join' should be inspected to understand how it processes the input matrices and determines their shape. This inspection should confirm if the method's behavior aligns with or differs from the reported issue, and identify if any further modifications or fixes are necessary to restore or align with the expected behavior.",

It's also possible that there were changes in how 'reduce' handles steps or in the matrices themselves independent of 'hstack'. To fully determine the cause of the behavioral change, a detailed comparison between the versions' implementations of 'hstack', 'row_join', and any related matrix handling methods, as well as an examination of the commit history and test cases around the version change, are necessary.",
