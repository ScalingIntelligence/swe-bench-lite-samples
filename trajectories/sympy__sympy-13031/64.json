The focus should be on understanding the logic in `MatrixShaping` class methods, especially `hstack` and `row_join`. The provided context already includes the relevant code spans for `MatrixShaping.hstack` and `MatrixShaping.row_join`. The new search results provide additional context, revealing that `hstack` uses `reduce` with `row_join`, suggesting a deeper look into `row_join` for potential changes related to zero-sized matrices. These additional code spans, particularly `MatrixShaping._eval_row_join`, may help in understanding how the dimensions are being calculated and if there are any conditions affecting the behavior around zero-sized matrices. Additionally, understanding the role of `classof` and how it determines class priority might be relevant.\n\nAfter analyzing the new search results, it is clear that `MatrixShaping._eval_row_join` is a crucial method to examine, as it contributes directly to the joining of matrix rows during `hstack` operations. Including this method in the analysis can help in spotting any differences in how SymPy 1.0 and 1.1 handle the joining of zero-sized matrices.\n\nMoreover, the `classof` function is also of interest as it determines the class type to be used for the new matrix formed by operations like `row_join`. This might influence the behavior of `hstack`, especially when dealing with matrices of different or zero sizes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans to investigate further are those pertaining to `MatrixShaping.hstack`, `MatrixShaping.row_join`, `MatrixShaping._eval_row_join`, and potentially `classof` to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the behavior change.",
