The issue specifically notes a difference in the output of the shape attribute after performing hstack operations with zero-sized matrices. Given this, the focus should be on understanding how the hstack method handles zero-sized matrices and its associated logic. The provided search results include a section of the \"common.py\" file which defines the MatrixShaping class containing the hstack method. This is directly relevant to the issue as it shows the implementation of the hstack method in question\u2014specifically, how it uses the 'row_join' method to concatenate matrices horizontally. This should be the primary focus for identifying the root cause of the behavior change and potential fixes, and thus, it is tagged as relevant. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that the entire section of code where hstack is defined is reviewed to maintain context and understand any potential interactions with other parts of the code, even if not immediately obvious from the reported issue.",
