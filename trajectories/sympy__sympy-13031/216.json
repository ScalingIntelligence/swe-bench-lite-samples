Specifically, the issue notes that stacking zero-sized matrices in `sympy` 1.1 yields a different shape compared to `sympy` 1.0. Upon examining the search results, the critical part to focus on is the `hstack` method implementation, as it directly relates to the issue. The `hstack` method is found within the `MatrixShaping` class in the `common.py` file. This method uses `reduce` with `row_join` to stack matrices horizontally, which provides a clear link to the issue of the shape discrepancy. Since the issue is about `hstack`, particularly when dealing with zero-sized matrices, the code span for `hstack` is highly relevant for further investigation or potential modification to resolve the reported issue.",
