The provided context includes file snippets from different parts of the SymPy library, but the primary focus should be on the files related to matrix operations and especially the hstack method. Given that the hstack method is a class method in `MatrixShaping` and appears in `sympy/matrices/common.py`, that is the first place to look for changes. Additional files like `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py` also may affect the stacking behavior indirectly. Therefore, search specifically in these files for the hstack method implementation or any code that interacts closely with it.",

Specifically, the behavior of hstack when dealing with matrices of zero rows has changed. According to the issue, in sympy 1.0, hstack on matrices with zero rows resulted in a matrix with a shape that summed the columns, while in sympy 1.1, it results in a shape that sums only the non-zero column matrices. The search results provided include the implementation of the hstack method within the MatrixShaping class in the sympy/matrices/common.py file. This code snippet is directly relevant to the issue as it shows the current implementation of the hstack method, which is likely responsible for the observed change in behavior between sympy versions.
