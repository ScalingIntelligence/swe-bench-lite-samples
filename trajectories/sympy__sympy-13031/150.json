The specific example provided shows that concatenating zero-sized matrices with different numbers of columns results in different shapes depending on the version. Given this, the code spans from the 'MatrixShaping' class appear to be directly relevant as they contain the implementations for 'hstack' and 'vstack'. These methods are responsible for horizontal and vertical stacking of matrices, respectively, and thus need to be examined to understand the behavior change. By focusing on the code spans that define these methods ('MatrixShaping.hstack' and 'MatrixShaping.vstack'), we can pinpoint where modifications might have occurred or where adjustments are needed to align the behavior with expectations. This initial identification will also aid in constructing any necessary modifications or fixes to restore the original functionality or to document the change clearly for users.",
