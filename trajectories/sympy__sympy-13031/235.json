Specifically, the issue focuses on the output shape of the matrix produced by `hstack` when called with matrices of varying dimensions. In sympy 1.0, hstacking matrices with zero rows returns a matrix with a width equal to the sum of the widths of the input matrices, whereas in sympy 1.1, the width is the sum of the widths of only the non-zero width matrices.\n\nGiven the context and the search results, the relevant code span is in the `sympy/matrices/common.py` file where the `hstack` method is defined. The key function to investigate is the `hstack` method itself within the `MatrixShaping` class. The method uses the `reduce` function along with `row_join` to concatenate the matrices horizontally. Understanding the changes or logic within this method should help in investigating why the behavior changed between versions.",
