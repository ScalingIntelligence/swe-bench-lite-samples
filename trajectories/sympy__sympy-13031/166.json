The most relevant files could be those dealing with matrix operations and expressions, such as 'common.py', 'matrices.py', 'matmul.py', and similar. Additionally, tracking the changes between versions in such a vital function like 'hstack' would also imply looking into any version-specific changes or patches that might have adjusted the behavior of 'hstack'.",
