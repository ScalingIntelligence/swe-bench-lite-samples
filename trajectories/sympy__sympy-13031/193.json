The example provided shows that stacking zero-row matrices in version 1.0 results in a matrix with a shape of (0, 6), while the same operation in version 1.1 results in a shape of (0, 3). This indicates a potential bug or a deliberate change in the implementation of the `hstack` method.\n\nUpon examining the provided search results, I found that `sympy/matrices/common.py` contains the `MatrixShaping` class, which includes the `hstack` method. The `hstack` method uses `row_join` to concatenate the matrices horizontally. It checks if there are no arguments and returns a new matrix if true. Otherwise, it uses the `row_join` method to join all the provided matrices. This section of the code is directly related to the functionality that the user is reporting an issue with.\n\nI've identified the relevant code span and determined that it is indeed relevant to the reported issue, as it pertains to the change in behavior of the `hstack` method between different sympy versions.",

The previous context provided the basic structure of the hstack method. Now, with the additional search results, it becomes clear that the key methods in question are `hstack` and `row_join`. The `hstack` method uses `reduce` with `row_join` to stack matrices horizontally. This implies that the logic in the `row_join` method is fundamentally important in understanding the change in behavior. The `row_join` method checks for matching rows between matrices and joins them by extending the columns, which directly affects the resulting shape of the matrix. Notably, the handling of matrices with zero rows or columns appears to give the observed change. Thus, the `row_join` implementation directly corresponds to the observed behavior change of the hstack method in sympy 1.1. Therefore, the identified spans include the `hstack` method itself and the crucial `row_join` method, both in the sympy/matrices/common.py file.",
