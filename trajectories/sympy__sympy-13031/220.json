Specifically, the issue notes a discrepancy in the shape of the resulting matrix when stacking zero-row matrices horizontally. In sympy 1.0, stacking zero-row matrices results in a matrix with a shape of `(0, 6)`, while in sympy 1.1, the shape is `(0, 3)`. The provided search results contain the implementation of the `hstack` method within the `MatrixShaping` class. This method is responsible for horizontally stacking matrices using the `reduce` function along with `row_join`. The method first checks if there are no arguments and returns a new matrix instance if true. Otherwise, it continues to stack the matrices using `row_join`. This implementation is directly relevant to the reported issue as it reveals how the stacking operation is being handled in sympy 1.1. Therefore, the identified code spans are pertinent to understanding and potentially resolving the described behavior change.",

The `row_join` method is implemented both in `MatrixShaping` and `NewMatrix` classes.\n3. The `row_join` method in `MatrixShaping` handles the joining of matrices with zero columns and checks for shape compatibility.\n4. The `row_join` method in `NewMatrix` also handles joining matrices but specializes in certain edge cases.\n5. The `SparseMatrix` class and its mutable variant in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py` implement `row_join` with specific handling for sparse matrices.\n\nGiven these contexts, the relevant code spans for addressing the issue, particularly the change in behavior observed between sympy 1.0 and 1.1, would be the implementations of `hstack` and `row_join` in both `MatrixShaping` and `NewMatrix` classes.",

The key elements to focus on are the MatrixShaping class and its methods hstack and row_join, as well as other relevant methods that might be affected by changes in hstack. From the provided context, it's evident that the MatrixShaping class and its methods are central to the issue. The new search results reaffirm this focus with additional instances of hstack and row_join methods, providing a more comprehensive view of their implementations across different files. Notably, the sympy/matrices/common.py file contains critical methods related to matrix shaping, directly relevant to understanding and resolving the issue. The search results do not introduce new functionalities or classes but rather provide more examples and context for the existing ones, which helps in understanding the scope and impact of the change reported in the issue.",
