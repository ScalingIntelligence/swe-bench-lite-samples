The primary focus should be on the `Axes3D` class in the `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` file, where the `set_visible` method might be defined or used. Additionally, the `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axis3d.py` file should be checked for any related functionalities within the `Axis` class that could be impacting the visibility settings for 3D plots. Since the `set_visible` method is seemingly not working, it seems likely that either the method or the related logic is not functioning properly. Therefore, a closer examination of the relevant class methods and their implementations is needed.",

Firstly, the `Axes3D` class definition and its various methods, especially those related to visibility and axis management. Secondly, the `Axis` class in `axis3d.py`, which deals with the specifics of 3D axis properties and behaviors. After reviewing the code, I believe the relevant spans are those within the `Axes3D` class that handle visibility settings (`set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on`), which might explain why the `set_visible` function is not working as expected in a 3D context.",

The current file context shows that the `Axes3D` class in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` has methods `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on` but lacks a proper `set_visible` method. The new search results provide several potential candidates for the `set_visible` method, including implementations in `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py`, `lib/mpl_toolkits/axisartist/axislines.py`, and `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`. However, none of these implementations are directly in the `Axes3D` class or its immediate parent class `Axes`. The most relevant code spans are those implementing `set_visible` in the `Artist` class (`lib/matplotlib/artist.py`) and the `SimpleAxisArtist` class (`lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py`), which might be used by `Axes3D` though not directly overridden. Further investigation is needed to determine if these methods are effectively called by `Axes3D` or if adjustments are needed in its implementation. Additionally, there's a need to verify if the `set_visible` method from the `Artist` class is being called correctly or overridden in `Axes3D` to handle visibility for 3D projections.",

The `set_visible` method in the `Artist` class is intended to control the visibility of the artist. However, `Axes3D` does not override this method, and the problem might lie in how the visibility is managed internally or in how the `Axes3D` object handles its rendering. A quick test can help validate if the issue is specific to `set_visible` being called too early or if there's deeper state management issue within `Axes3D`. Since the baseline behavior of `set_visible` in `Artist` is to just toggle the `_visible` attribute and mark the artist as stale, and to verify if calling `set_visible(False)` immediately after object creation is problematic, we can adjust the initialization or implementation to ensure proper visibility handling.",
