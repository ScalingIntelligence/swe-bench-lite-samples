The issue involves the `set_visible()` method which should control the visibility of an element, but fails under certain conditions in a 3D context. \n\nThe analysis of the `Axes3D` class in `axes3d.py` revealed that it inherits from the `Axes` class but did not immediately show any override or modification of the `set_visible()` method, indicating a potential disconnect in how visibility is handled in a 3D context.\n\nIn `artist.py`, the `Artist` class contains the `set_visible()` method, which sets the `_visible` attribute and marks the artist as stale. This method could be where the function fails or behaves unexpectedly in derived classes like `Axes3D`. \n\nGiven the issue report, it seems that the primary issue is with the `set_visible` method not properly affecting the visibility of the 3D axes. Therefore, focusing on the `Axes3D` class constructor, where initial properties might set conditions that affect visibility unknowingly, and the `Artist.set_visible()` method gives us the initial best guesses for relevant code spans.\n\nThe task does not require immediate focus on modifying entries since the issue appears potentially rooted in method behavior, but behind-the-scenes conditions (i.e., 'stale' states, internal 'visible' tracking), rather than missing functions. Subsequent steps should involve closer inspection to determine if the issue is related to state management or internal property handling within these classes. It's also critical to review other potential contextual factors during the debugging process that might influence the visibility handling of the 3D axes.",

Notably, the superclass Axes does not override the `set_visible()` function, indicating the implementation should be sourced from Axes or an antecedent class. 'artist.py' includes the foundational base class Artist, from which Axes is derived and which contains a `set_visible()` method, indicating it might articulate Axes3D's visibility behavior. Given the fact that Axes3D does not explicitly override `set_visible()`, the core mechanisms likely originate from Artist.

From the context and search results, it's clear that `Axes3D` is the class handling 3D subplots and inherits from `Axes`. The `Artist` class, which `Axes` inherits from, has the `set_visible` method. While the `Axes3D` class overrides some methods from `Axes`, it does not override `set_visible`, implying that the method in `Artist` should handle the visibility of `Axes3D` objects. However, the issue persists, indicating a potential problem in `Axes3D` or in how `Axes3D` uses the `set_visible` method from `Artist`. Further examination of `Axes3D`'s interaction with `set_visible` and its own visibility handling is needed. Additionally, the `_SelectorWidget`, `ToolLineHandles`, and `ToolHandles` classes in `widgets.py` and `SimpleAxisArtist` in `mpl_axes.py` also have `set_visible` methods which could be related to the issue, but they focus on different parts of the UI and might not directly relate to the 3D subplot visibility problem.
