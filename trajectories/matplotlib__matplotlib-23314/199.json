            "scratch_pad": "Upon reviewing the reported issue, it is clear that the focus is on the set_visible() method not functioning as expected when applied to 3D subplots in the matplotlib library. The provided search results contain multiple files and spans of code, notably including classes like Axes3D, SimpleAxisArtist, Artist, _SelectorWidget, ToolLineHandles, and AxisArtist, each of which has a method named set_visible(). Given the context of the issue, the most relevant file appears to be 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py', which contains the Axes3D class that is likely responsible for handling 3D projections in matplotlib. Diving deeper into the Axes3D class, the __init__ method and associated functionalities related to 3D projections are observed, which suggest that potential issues with set_visible() might stem from here or related methods in this class. However, a direct set_visible method is not immediately found within this class's spans, nor within its direct methods. This lack of direct method within Axes3D might imply that the issue could stem from inheritance, where Axes3D might inherit the set_visible method from a superclass where it's not being overridden or effectively utilized in the context of 3D plotting. The other classes like Artist, SimpleAxisArtist, etc., though they contain set_visible methods, are likely related to more general artist management or 2D axis management, which might serve as a clue that the specific handling of visibility for 3D elements might be missing or inconsistent compared to 2D elements. Overall, the search appears to be pointing towards an issue where specific handling for visibility management (set_visible) in 3D projections might be missing or underdeveloped within the Axes3D class or the hierarchy of classes managing Axes in matplotlib. However, the exact span where this disparity or bug is occurring would need additional inspection, specifically looking at the inheritance structures and how the method might be getting treated differently in 3D context vs 2D. For now, identifying the Axes3D class in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py' for further debugging and analysis seems prudent.",

The focus is on understanding why `set_visible(False)` does not hide the subplot with a 3D projection.\n\nAnalysis of the provided search results and context suggest that the key issue lies in the implementation of the `set_visible` method in classes related to Axes, particularly for 3D projections. Initially, there was a reference in the file context pointing to `Axes3D`, but it did not include the `set_visible` method. The new search results include multiple files with instances of `set_visible` methods, which is crucial for understanding how visibility is controlled.\n\nRelevant files and spans are those directly referencing or implementing the `set_visible` method. For instance, `mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py` contains a `set_visible` method that directly manipulates visibility, including the spines. This is particularly relevant as spines are part of the subplot's visibility control. Additionally, `matplotlib/artist.py` also has a `set_visible` method applicable to the Artist class, which Axes inherit from, suggesting it might be involved in the visibility control chain for 3D plots. Furthermore, `matplotlib/widgets.py` includes a `set_visible` method specific to widgets, indicating a broader application of visibility control across different Matplotlib components.\n\nOverall, the most relevant file appears to be `mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py`, which includes the `SimpleAxisArtist.set_visible` method, directly associated with controlling the visibility of axis elements, which is key for the reported issue. The other `set_visible` methods found within different classes could potentially influence the visibility behavior, but aren't directly implicated in the issue at hand based on the given context and issue details.",
