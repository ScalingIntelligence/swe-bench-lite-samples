Upon analyzing the search results, the code spans relevant to the Axes3D class and its initialization in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py' were identified as potentially affecting the visibility of the 3D axes. This includes the __init__ method of Axes3D, which sets up the 3D view and initializes various properties related to visibility. Additionally, the base class Artist in 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py' was examined since it defines the set_visible method and therefore could be where the issue with visibility control lies.

Specifically, when set_visible(False) is called on a subplot with projection='3d', the subplot remains visible, which should not happen. According to the user's code example, they are importing 'matplotlib.pyplot as plt' and using the 3D projection. The relevant code spans identified in the file context include the initialization of the Axes3D class and the implementation of the set_visible method in the Artist class. The search results provided the same code spans as in the file context for the Axes3D class initialization. Given this, it's clear that the problem might be in how the set_visible method is overridden or how visibility is managed in the Axes3D class. Thus, the relevant code spans are the initialization of the Axes3D class and the set_visible method implementation.",

No direct mention or modification of the `_visible` attribute is observed here, which contrasts with the expectation based on the standard `Artist` class behavior in the context from `artist.py`. However, the code flow shows how axes visibility might be indirectly affected during instantiation, particularly in callbacks and event handling (`self.figure.canvas.callbacks`) setup. Additionally, a call to `self.set_axis_on()` concludes the initialization, hinting that visibility might be controlled through specific inherited methods or settings not explicitly detailed here. Further examination should expand into looking at the `set_axis_on` method itself and similar methods from the inheritance chain that `Axes3D` follows from `Axes` and `Artist`.

This issue seems to be related to the `Axes3D` class in the `mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` file and the `Artist` class in the `matplotlib/artist.py` file. In the given context, the `Axes3D` class extends `Axes` and overrides some of its methods. The `Axes3D` class does not have a `set_visible` method directly, which indicates that it relies on the `set_visible` method from its parent class. However, the subclass may override or affect the visibility behavior. The `Artist` class is a base class for all objects that can be drawn on a matplotlib figure and has a `set_visible` method which is used by `Axes` and `Axes3D`. Reviewing the `set_visible` method in the `Artist` class is crucial. Additionally, several spans from `Axes3D` are relevant as they provide insights into the initialization and setup of the 3D axes, which might affect the visibility. Identified spans include the `Axes3D.__init__`, `Axes3D.set_axis_off`, `Axes3D.set_axis_on`, and others from both `Axes3D` and `Artist`, as they provide a clearer picture of how the `set_visible` method may interact with other attributes and methods of `Axes3D`.",

However, the code flow shows how axes visibility might be indirectly affected during instantiation, particularly in callbacks and event handling (`self.figure.canvas.callbacks`) setup. Additionally, a call to `self.set_axis_on()` concludes the initialization, hinting that visibility might be controlled through specific inherited methods or settings not explicitly detailed here. Further examination should expand into looking at the `set_axis_on` method itself and similar methods from the inheritance chain that `Axes3D` follows from `Axes` and `Artist`.
