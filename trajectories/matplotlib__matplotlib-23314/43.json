The provided code example uses `matplotlib.pyplot.subplots` with `projection='3d'`, hence the relevant classes and functions should be within the mplot3d toolkit. From the file context provided, the `Axes3D` class in `axes3d.py` is a likely candidate as it manages axis-related properties and methods for 3D plots. Another file to check could be `axis3d.py`, which might contain properties and methods related to the individual axis visibilities in a 3D plot settings.",

The search results include code from `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` and `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axis3d.py`. The key spans to focus on are those related to the `Axes3D` class and its methods, particularly those that handle visibility settings or initialization. The spans `Axes3D.__init__`, `Axes3D.set_axis_off`, and `Axes3D.set_axis_on` are particularly relevant as they deal with the axis visibility and initialization of the Axes3D class. Additionally, the `Axis` class in `axis3d.py` is relevant as it could also influence the visibility settings for the axes. Since the issue involves the `set_visible()` method not working, it's important to analyze the methods and properties related to visibility in both classes to determine the root cause. The search results have provided a comprehensive view of the code relevant to the visibility settings in 3D plots.",

The issue seems to be about subplots with a '3d' projection, where `set_visible` does not hide the subplot when set to `False`. I reviewed the provided context and new search results. The context included relevant code spans from `Axes3D` and `Axis` classes specifying their initialization, and toggle functions. Among the search results, I focused on the `Axes3D`, `SimpleAxisArtist`, `Artist`, and `_SelectorWidget` classes. I looked for overrides or control flow of the `set_visible` method as well as setups most relevant to 3D projection. Upon analyzing the search results and the context, I identified some spans that contained the critical keyword and hint. These code spans provide a detail of the `set_visible` attribute which could prove to be adherent to understanding the functionality for a 3D projection.",

The `Axes3D` class, which is used for 3D plotting, does not override or implement a `set_visible` method explicitly in the provided code context. The `set_visible` method is inherited from the `Artist` class, but its functionality seems not to be working as expected in the context of 3D plots. Since the `Axes3D` class does not include a custom implementation of `set_visible`, and the inheritance chain includes the `Artist` class, further investigation into why the method is not effective in a 3D context would be necessary. However, this specific task does not allow for modifications outside the immediate context provided.",
