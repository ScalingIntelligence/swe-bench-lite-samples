Two potentially relevant files from the context are `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` and `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axis3d.py`. These files contain the `Axes3D` class and `Axis` class respectively, which might be involved in setting visibility for 3D plots. By specifying the `file_pattern` to these paths, we can narrow down the search to code specifically related to the 3D projection functionality. Additionally, since the issue is directly related to the `set_visible` method for 3D plots, the `query` parameter is set to this method name to help identify the relevant parts of the code.",

Given this, the focus should be on identifying code related to the visibility of 3D axes or any functions that might control the visibility of 3D elements. After examining the provided search results, it's clear that the relevant classes and methods directly related to the visibility of 3D axes are Axes3D and its methods such as set_axis_off and set_axis_on. Additionally, tracing the functionality of set_visible through Axes3D would be crucial. The search results provide a comprehensive view of the Axes3D class and nested functions, including those that directly manipulate visibility and state management (like set_axis_off and set_axis_on), implying they mirror set_visible functionality within a 3D context. There are no similar methods explicitly named 'set_visible' in the search results, but the state-setting methods like 'set_axis_off' can be seen as counterparts, assuming they control elements' visibility similarly to how set_visible does in a 2D context. Given the lack of an explicit 'set_visible' method in the 3D module, this might suggest that set_visible is implemented differently in this subclass of Axes, or the issue could be where the 2D logic might not correctly extend to 3D surfaces and projections, necessitating adjustments in Axes3D's treatment of visibility flags. Furthermore, due to the absence of an explicitly named method in the results for 'set_visible' in a 3D context, it's logical to conclude that the issue reported might stem from the implementation's divergence between 2D and 3D projections concerning state and visibility management, not directly from a broken method but a logical inconsistency or unchecked branching that impacts the visibility across different dimensionality. Future fix should entail correcting these logical branches or state adjustments across these differing implementations.",

To address this, it's important to look at the `set_visible` method implementation and how it interacts with the 3D axes. The current file context shows that there are methods like `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on` in the `Axes3D` class, but no direct mention of `set_visible`. However, the search results provide insights into the `set_visible` method implemented in the `Artist` class, which is a base class for many matplotlib elements including axes. This method sets the `_visible` attribute and marks the artist as stale, indicating that it needs to be redrawn. Given that `Axes3D` inherits from `Axes` and `Axes` inherits from `Artist`, it's plausible that the `set_visible` method from `Artist` is being used. Therefore, the relevant code spans are from the `Artist` class, specifically the `set_visible` method, as it likely forms the basis for the `set_visible` functionality in the `Axes3D` context. Additionally, the `_SelectorWidget` and `ToolLineHandles` classes also implement `set_visible` methods, which might interact with the axes in a similar manner, but for the purposes of the reported issue, the focus should remain on the `Artist` class, which is fundamental to the visibility handling of all matplotlib artists.",

The `set_visible` method is expected to hide the subplot when set to `False`, but it fails to do so. The search results contain several instances of the `set_visible` method across different classes, including `SimpleAxisArtist`, `Artist`, `_SelectorWidget`, and `ToolLineHandles`. Additionally, the `Axes3D` class from the `mplot3d` toolkit is of particular interest as it directly handles 3D projections. The `Axes3D` class inherits from `Artist`, and understanding how visibility is managed in both classes is crucial. The `Artist` class contains the implementation of `set_visible` that directly affects the `_visible` attribute and marks the artist as stale, which updates the canvas.\n\nThe search results confirm the presence of `set_visible` methods in relevant classes, and the existing context further emphasizes the importance of the `Axes3D` class. Given the nature of the issue, the identified code spans are relevant as they either directly or indirectly influence the visibility management of artists in 3D contexts.\n\nThe identified spans provide a comprehensive view of how visibility is controlled in classes that are likely to be involved in rendering the 3D axes, making it sufficient to conclude the search task for the reported issue by using these spans specifically from `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` and `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`.",
