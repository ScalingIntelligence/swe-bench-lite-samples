Specifically, when 'set_visible' is set to False, the subplot should not be visible, but it remains visible. The provided search results contain code from the 'axes3d.py' file, which is relevant to the issue as it pertains to the 'Axes3D' class and its methods. The relevant code spans include the initialization of the 'Axes3D' class, as well as methods for setting the axis on or off. However, there is no direct implementation of 'set_visible'. This suggests that 'set_visible' might be an inherited method from the 'Axes' class, and the issue could be related to how 'Axes3D' interacts with or overrides this inherited behavior. Given this context, it appears that the current search results do not directly address the implementation of 'set_visible' for 3D axes, as the spans identified do not contain the method in question. Further investigation or search for the specific implementation of 'set_visible' in the 'Axes' class or other related classes may be necessary to resolve the issue.",
