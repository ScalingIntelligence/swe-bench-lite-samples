The 'set_visible' method should change the visibility of an artist (like an axes), but in this case, it fails to hide the 3D subplot when set to False. This indicates a potential bug in the implementation or logic handling the visibility state of artists in 3D projections. The search results provided include two files: 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/widgets.py'. In 'artist.py', the 'Artist' class is relevant, especially its 'set_visible' method, which directly involves the visibility setting functionality. There, 'set_visible' changes the '_visible' attribute and triggers updates to the state and rendering. This method seems to be where the visibility bug might be originating from when applied to 3D projections. On the other hand, 'widgets.py' contains the '_SelectorWidget' class with its own 'set_visible' method. However, this class is more about widgets and their visibility, not directly related to the axes visibility issue specific to 3D projections. Based on the relevance to the reported issue, the focus should remain on 'artist.py' where the core functionality of setting visibility is implemented for all artist types.",

The `Axes3D` class inherits from `Axes` and should therefore also inherit the `set_visible` method from `Artist`, but there might be an issue in its implementation or interaction specific to 3D plotting. Other files in the search results, like `mpl_axes.py` and `widgets.py`, also have classes with a `set_visible` method, but these are less relevant to the issue at hand. Given the context, the most relevant code spans are likely those in `axes3d.py` and `artist.py` that directly relate to the `Artist` class and its `set_visible` method, as well as the `Axes3D` subclass. Specifically, the `axes3d.py` file does not override the `set_visible` method as seen in the `artist.py` file, suggesting that the issue might not lie in an overridden method but possibly in the integration with 3D-specific functionality. Further examination of `axes3d.py` could yield insights into how 3D subplots handle visibility.",
