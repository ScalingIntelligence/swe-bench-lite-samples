The provided code sample and descriptions suggest that the problem might be related to the implementation of the set_visible method within the 3D Axes class (Axes3D). In particular, the behavior of this method when the projection is set to '3d' needs to be examined. Given the code context and the emphasis on 3D projections, focusing on the `axes3d.py` file where the Axes3D class is defined seems appropriate. Additionally, the `axis3d.py` file also should be checked as it contains the Axis class which might interact with the visibility settings.",

Additionally, 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py' contains the set_visible method, which is inherited by Axes3D. This method may need to be overridden or adjusted within the Axes3D class to handle 3D specific behavior correctly.
