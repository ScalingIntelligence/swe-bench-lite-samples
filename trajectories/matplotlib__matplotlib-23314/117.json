The user's code shows that they are using `plt.subplots` with `subplot_kw={'projection': '3d'}` and attempting to set an axis invisible with `ax1.set_visible(False)`. Despite setting visibility to False, the axis remains visible. To address this, we need to find the relevant code spans that deal with the visibility setting in 3D plots. The search results include several files, but the most relevant ones are `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` and `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`. The `Axes3D` class in `axes3d.py` is specifically for 3D plotting, but it does not directly override the `set_visible` method. Instead, it inherits from `Axes` and `Artist`. In `artist.py`, the `Artist` class has a `set_visible` method, which is used by `Axes`. This method sets the visibility of the artist and marks it as stale for redrawing. Given that `Axes3D` does not have a customized `set_visible` method, the issue may lie in how the `Artist` class's `set_visible` method interacts with `Axes3D` when called on a 3D axis. I will mark the relevant spans for further review.",

The `Axes3D` class in `axes3d.py` is derived from the `Axes` class and is specifically designed for handling 3D plots. However, the `set_visible` method, which controls the visibility of elements, is not directly overridden or extended in the provided snippet of `Axes3D`. This suggests that the `set_visible` function might be inherited from a higher-level class or module. The second file, `artist.py`, defines the `Artist` class, which includes a `set_visible` method. Since `Axes3D` inherits from `Axes`, which in turn inherits from `Artist`, it's possible that the `set_visible` method in question is coming from the `Artist` class. This method sets the visibility flag and marks the artist as stale, indicating that the plot needs to be redrawn.

The key elements to look for in the codebase are the implementation of the `set_visible()` method and how it interacts with 3D axes specifically. From the provided file context, we already have the `Artist` class and its `set_visible()` method, which is likely a base class for other objects, including `Axes`. Additionally, there's the `Axes3D` class in `axes3d.py`, which extends `Axes` for 3D plotting. In the new search results, several additional files and spans were found, including implementations of `Axes` in different modules, and subclasses like `SimpleAxisArtist`. The `SimpleAxisArtist` class also has a `set_visible()` method, which could be relevant depending on how 3D axes handle their visibility. Furthermore, the `_SelectorWidget` and `ToolHandles` classes in `widgets.py` also have `set_visible()` methods, potentially related to UI components. However, the main focus should still be on the `Axes3D` class and its interactions, as well as any related methods in the `Artist` class hierarchy. Given this analysis, the most relevant spans to the issue are those related directly to the `Axes3D` class and its base classes or mixins that might override or interact with the `set_visible()` method.",
