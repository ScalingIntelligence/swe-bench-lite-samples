Given the nature of the problem, it's crucial to investigate the implementation of the `set_visible` method within the context of 3D axes specifically. The provided code snippet suggests that the visibility setting is not being applied as expected. To resolve this, the relevant part of the code where the visibility of the 3D axes is controlled or modified should be located. The files provided suggest possible locations where this logic might be implemented, with files such as `mplot3d/axes3d.py` being a prime candidate. Therefore, the search should focus on finding the implementation of `set_visible` for 3D axes within the `mplot3d` toolkit.",

In 'axes3d.py', there are several relevant spans: 'Axes3D.__init__', 'Axes3D.set_axis_off', and 'Axes3D.set_axis_on'. These methods seem to control the visibility of the axis in 3D. Additionally, 'Axes3D.set_zlim' and other similar methods could potentially be related to how visibility is managed. In 'axis3d.py', the 'Axis' class and its methods might also be relevant, though they seem more focused on axis properties like pane colors and positions rather than visibility directly.

It is possible that the `set_visible` method is inherited from a more general context where aspects like 'visible' or 'invisible' might be handled differently for 3D axes. To proceed, we should look into how visibility is managed in the `Axes` base class and then consider whether these behaviors might be overridden or adjusted in the `Axes3D` class. This investigation should include examining attribute definitions and methods related to visibility in the `Axes` class, and then checking if these are utilized or altered in the subclass `Axes3D`.",

The spans with IDs 'Axes3D.set_axis_off' and 'Axes3D.set_axis_on' seem to be directly related to setting the visibility state of the axis in a 3D context. These are the most relevant spans to the reported issue since they directly deal with the visibility of the 3D axes, which is the core problem mentioned in the issue.\n\nThe search results also include additional spans within the `Axes3D` class. However, upon reviewing the entire class and focusing on the relevant functionality tied to the issue, I find that the other spans such as 'Axes3D.convert_zunits', 'Axes3D.set_top_view', 'Axes3D.draw', etc., while important for the overall functionality of the `Axes3D` class, are not directly related to the visibility issue reported. \n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, I will identify the spans 'Axes3D.set_axis_off' and 'Axes3D.set_axis_on' as relevant to the reported issue.",

It is possible that the `set_visible` method is inherited from a more general context where aspects like 'visible' or 'invisible' might be handled differently for 3D axes. To proceed, we should look into how visibility is managed in the `Axes` base class and then consider whether these behaviors might be overridden or adjusted in the `Axes3D` class.

The absence of an explicit `set_visible` method in the `Axes3D` class suggests that the functionality might be inherited from its parent class `Axes` or possibly another base class. This inherited behavior, combined with the specific methods `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on` in `Axes3D`, might demonstrate a different implementation or interpretation of visibility settings for 3D axes in comparison to 2D axes.

The absence of relevant results also indicates that the issue might be rooted in a deeper-level architectural difference between handling visibility for 2D versus 3D axes.

This might suggest that the method is either not explicitly named as such or it is managed through a different mechanism within the library. Given the specific methods `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on` found within the `Axes3D` class, it's possible that the visibility of 3D axes is managed through these methods instead of a dedicated `set_visible` method. These methods toggle the visibility state between off and on.
