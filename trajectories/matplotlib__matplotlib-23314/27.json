However, there is no direct span for `set_visible` method. Given the context, the spans related to visibility control, such as `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on`, might be relevant as they directly control the visibility of axes. Additionally, methods like `grid` and `do_3d_projection` in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py` are also relevant as they deal with rendering aspects which could be related to visibility.

This suggests that the visibility behavior might be influenced by the base `Artist` class. Furthermore, the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` file has an `Axes` class that could be another base class for `Axes3D`, potentially contributing to how visibility is handled.\n\nGiven this information, the identified relevant code spans are in:\n- `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`: For the `Artist` class and its `set_visible` method.\n- `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`: To understand the base `Axes` class, which might also influence visibility settings.\n- `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py`: Specifically, focusing on overriding or extending the behavior of `set_visible` in the `Axes3D` class.",

The `Artist` class includes the `set_visible` method, which sets the visibility of the artist. This method is likely what is being used by instances of `Axes3D`, although it may not be specifically overridden in the `Axes3D` class. The `Axes3D` class in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` demonstrates methods related to axis visibility, such as `set_axis_on` and `set_axis_off`, but it does not explicitly redefine `set_visible`. Therefore, any issues with `set_visible` not working for `Axes3D` might be due to how the visibility state is managed or rendered in the 3D context, potentially within the `draw` method or other rendering-related methods in `Axes3D`. Additionally, considering the context provided and the absence of specific mentions of `set_visible` in the `Axes3D` code, it appears that the relevant implementation relies on the base class method.
