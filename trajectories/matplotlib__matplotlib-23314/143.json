Given the context provided, I will focus the search on files related to 3D plotting in Matplotlib, specifically looking for the `set_visible` method within 3D axes classes. The relevant file patterns might include those related to `mplot3d` and `axes3d`, as they seem to be central to the 3D plotting functionality in Matplotlib.",

The primary search results include the Axes3D class from 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py', which is directly related to the 3D projection functionality. In this class, several methods are defined that could be related to the visibility of the axes, such as set_axis_off() and set_axis_on(). Interestingly, although the set_visible() method is mentioned in other contexts (like SimpleAxisArtist in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py' and in the Artist base class in 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py'), the actual implementation of set_visible() in the context of Axes3D is not present, indicating a potential gap in the functionality. This absence might be the root cause of the reported issue where set_visible() does not seem to affect the visibility of the axes in a 3D projection. To confirm and potentially solve this issue, further investigation is needed into why the set_visible() method is not implemented within the Axes3D class and how it could be integrated or replaced for proper functionality in 3D projections.",

Key elements to focus on include the `Axes3D` class and its methods, particularly where visibility settings might be overridden or not applied correctly. Additionally, understanding how visibility is managed in the parent `Artist` class and ensuring that `Axes3D` properly inherits or overrides these behaviors is crucial. From the search results, several relevant spans have been identified, including: \n1. The `Axes3D` class definition and its `__init__` method.\n2. The `set_visible` method in the `Artist` class, which `Axes3D` inherits from.\n3. The `set_visible` method in the `SimpleAxisArtist` class, which directly sets the visibility of various components.\n4. The `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on` methods in the `Axes3D` class, indicating how axes visibility is toggled.\n5. The `Patch3DCollection` and `Poly3DCollection` classes, which handle visibility for 3D collections. These spans are relevant because they provide insights into how visibility is controlled in both the 3D context and the base class. This helps in identifying where the issue might be occurring or how it could be fixed in `Axes3D` specifics.
