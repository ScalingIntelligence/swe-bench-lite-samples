The provided code snippet and the expected behavior suggest that the axes should be hidden when set_visible(False) is called, but this is not happening. The search results provided include relevant code from the 'axes3d.py' file within the 'mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/' directory. Specifically, the classes and methods in the search results are related to the handling of 3D axes, including the initialization, drawing, and clearing of these axes. The 'Axes3D' class and its methods likely contain the logic that manages the visibility of the axes. The '__init__' method sets up the initial state, the 'draw' method is responsible for rendering, and the 'clear' method resets the axes. By examining these methods, we can better understand where the visibility handling might be failing or where additional handling is needed for the set_visible() method. Thus, these code spans are relevant to resolving the reported issue.",

Focusing on visibility state management in these methods could provide insights into the issue with `set_visible()`. The `draw()` method iterates over child artists that are collections or patches and ensures they are visible based on their `get_visible()` method. The `clear()` method, however, doesn't explicitly reset visibility states but does reset limits and scales. Further investigation might involve exploring how artists' visibility is set and checked in relation to the 3D projection, particularly focusing on any interactions with the `grid()` method or other components that could influence visibility.",

After analyzing the provided codebase, it becomes apparent that the `Axes3D` class in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` does not override the `set_visible` method from its parent class. The `set_visible` method is inherited from the `Artist` class, found in `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`. There's a critical necessity to inspect the implementation of `set_visible` within the `Artist` class and how it interacts with 3D axes objects. No additional overloading or specific differentiation for 3D axes was detected in the provided code herein. Furthermore, subsets of additional files and their code spans involving the `set_visible` method were made available for thorough examination, yet none overlay with functionality specific to 3D rendering handles. Consequently, a findable relevant code part would be the essential `set_visible` method in the `Artist` class, as the direct hyper-specific problem's source, superseding type-based inferences, would be both task-specific and appropriate considering knowledge gaps such as the exclusion of context affecting shared functions between 2D/3D implementations, as outlined in the reported issue.",
