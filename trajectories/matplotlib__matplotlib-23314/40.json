Specifically, the issue mentions that when calling `set_visible(False)` on an axis in a 3D projection, the axis remains visible. The search results provide context from `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py`, which is highly relevant as it contains the definition of the `Axes3D` class, the class responsible for handling 3D plots in matplotlib. The `Axes3D.__init__` method and the class definition itself are central to understanding how 3D axes are initialized and managed. Additionally, the presence of methods like `set_proj_type` and `view_init` further supports the relevance of this file to the issue. No other file or code span in the search results directly addresses the issue of `set_visible` not working in 3D projections. Given the specificity of the issue and the direct relevance of the identified code, it is reasonable to conclude that the provided search results are sufficient for addressing the reported issue.",

To address this, I looked into the provided search results and focused on the `Artist` class within the `matplotlib/artist.py` file, as this is a foundational class in Matplotlib that manages the visibility of artists. The code span with the `set_visible` method in the `Artist` class appears to handle the visibility settings for all artists. Given the bug description and the context provided, this `set_visible` method in the `Artist` class is highly relevant to the issue at hand, as it directly manipulates the visibility state of an artist. Therefore, I have identified the `set_visible` method in the `Artist` class as the relevant code span to address the reported issue.",

The search results have provided additional context around the `set_visible` method in the `Artist` class, `SimpleAxisArtist`, and `_SelectorWidget`. Despite having multiple implementations, none of these directly address the issue mentioned in the report. Notably, `SimpleAxisArtist` and `_SelectorWidget` customize the `set_visible` method, but they do not relate to the 3D projection issue.
