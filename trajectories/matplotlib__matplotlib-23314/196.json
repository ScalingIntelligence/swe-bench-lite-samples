The relevant files identified are primarily in the `mplot3d` subdirectory, which is responsible for handling 3D projections. Specifically, investigating the `axes3d.py` file is crucial as it contains the `Axes3D` class, which likely includes the implementation of the `set_visible` method or related visibility control functionality. Additionally, it's worth checking the `axis3d.py` file for any intersection with axis-level visibility settings. Other files listed, such as 'axisartist/axislines.py' and 'axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py', might also contain useful code regarding axis visibility in different contexts, but for the primary issue, the focus should remain on `mplot3d` files.",

In the provided search results, several relevant code spans have been identified. First, the `Axes3D` class in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` contains method definitions that are pertinent to 3D axes functionality, including `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on`. However, the actual implementation of `set_visible` within the `Axes3D` class is missing. Secondly, the `SimpleAxisArtist` class in `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py` has a `set_visible` method, which could potentially be related to the issue if `Axes3D` subclasses or interacts with `SimpleAxisArtist`. Lastly, the `Artist` class in `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` defines a `set_visible` method that could be inherited by `Axes3D`. Given the provided context and the lack of a direct implementation of `set_visible` within `Axes3D`, it can be inferred that there might be a missing implementation or an issue with method inheritance that needs to be addressed.",

The Axes3D class in mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py does not directly include a set_visible method, indicating that this method is not explicitly defined or overridden for 3D axes in the provided context. However, the Artist class in matplotlib/artist.py does include a set_visible method that might be inherited by Axes3D. The SimpleAxisArtist class in mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py also includes a set_visible method that influences the visibility of individual axis lines, which might be relevant for components of 3D axes. Given the complexity of Matplotlib's class hierarchy and the modular nature of its design, the current file context, while not providing a direct set_visible method in Axes3D, offers insights into the potential influences and inherited behaviors affecting visibility. Detailed examination of the inherited and related methods suggests that visibility settings could be influenced by these methods operating at different levels of the object hierarchy.",
