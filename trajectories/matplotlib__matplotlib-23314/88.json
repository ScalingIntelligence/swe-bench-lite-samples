The first file, 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py', contains the definition of the Axes3D class, which is related to the 3D projection mentioned in the issue. The second file, 'lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py', contains the definition of the SimpleAxisArtist class, which includes a method named set_visible(). This method appears to be unrelated to the Axes3D class but is noteworthy as it redefines the set_visible() method. Given the nature of the issue, the most relevant code spans are those within the Axes3D class. Since the issue directly involves the Axes3D class and its set_visible() function, I will focus on identifying the relevant code spans within this class.",
