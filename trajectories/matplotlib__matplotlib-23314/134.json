Focusing on the provided search results, the relevant code spans should include the implementation of `Axes3D`, specifically the `set_visible` method if implemented, or any related methods that could affect visibility in 3D plots. Additionally, inspecting the `SimpleAxisArtist` and `Artist` classes for the `set_visible` method is important as they provide the foundational visibility control.The search results include the `Axes3D` class in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py', but it lacks a definition for `set_visible`. The `SimpleAxisArtist` class in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py' has a `set_visible` method, and the `Artist` class in 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py' also defines it. Given the issue's focus on 3D plots, the `Axes3D` class and its interaction with the visibility controls from 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py' are critical.Diving deeper, the absence of `set_visible` in the `Axes3D` class suggests that the visibility control might be either overridden or not implemented in `Axes3D`, leading to the observed bug. Therefore, the relevant spans identified are the entire `Axes3D` class and the `set_visible` method in `Artist` and `SimpleAxisArtist` classes.",

From the initial inspection, neither `Axes3D` nor its parent `Axes` class directly overrides the `set_visible` method. This means the method in question might be inheriting its functionality directly from the `Artist` class.

This method should be added to properly handle the visibility setting for Axes3D instances. The lines to be modified would be where the class Axes3D is defined and potentially where methods common to Axes are defined (if set_visible is inherited or needs overriding). However, without an existing `set_visible` method in the provided code scope, we need to add one around line 89 to maintain order and context within the existing methods.",
