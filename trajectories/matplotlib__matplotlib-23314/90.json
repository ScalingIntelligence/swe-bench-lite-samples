In `axes3d.py`, the `Axes3D` class is defined, which is relevant to the 3D projection mentioned in the issue. Specifically, the `__init__` method of `Axes3D` is identified as relevant because it sets up the 3D axes. In `mpl_axes.py`, the `SimpleAxisArtist` class and its `set_visible` method are found, which is directly related to the issue of `set_visible()` not working as expected. The `set_visible` method in `SimpleAxisArtist` is essential to understand how visibility is managed in Matplotlib. Given these findings, it seems both files are relevant to the issue, particularly the `Axes3D` class and the `set_visible` method in `SimpleAxisArtist`.",

The user expects that setting `set_visible(False)` on a subplot with `projection='3d'` should make the subplot invisible. However, this is not happening.\n\nIn the provided file context, the `Axes3D` class in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` does not override the `set_visible` method from its parent class `Axes`. This indicates that the `set_visible` method used is likely inherited from `Axes`.\n\nIn the new search results, the `set_visible` method in `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` defines the behavior for `Artist` objects, which `Axes` (and by extension `Axes3D`) inherit from. The method sets the `_visible` attribute to the provided boolean value and marks the artist as stale.\n\nAdditionally, in `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py`, the `SimpleAxisArtist` class also defines a `set_visible` method, which toggles visibility for various components and calls `self.line.set_visible(b)` and `self._axis.set_visible(True)`. This might influence how the visibility is managed for axes components in a different context.\n\nGiven this information, it seems the visibility issue might be related to how the `set_visible` method interacts with the specific properties and states of the `Axes3D` instance, possibly due to a missing or incorrect implementation of visibility toggling within the 3D-specific attributes or rendering logic.",
