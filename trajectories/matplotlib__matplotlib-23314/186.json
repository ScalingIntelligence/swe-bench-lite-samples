Given the context and the code snippet provided, the problem likely lies within the `Axes3D` class or its associated methods. The `set_visible` function should be controlling the visibility of the subplot, but it appears to be failing to do so. Based on the file patterns provided for the relevant files, specifically `axes3d.py`, we will focus our search there to find the implementation of `set_visible` or any related methods in the `Axes3D` class.",

Analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are primarily within the `Axes3D` class definition in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py`. Specifically, the spans that include methods related to visibility control, such as `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on`, are relevant. These methods control the visibility state of the 3D axes, which is central to the issue described. Additionally, the initialization of the `Axes3D` class and methods related to setting limits and scales in 3D space (`set_zlim`, `set_zscale`, etc.) are also examined to understand how visibility might be affected by these settings. This comprehensive review ensures that the identified code spans are thoroughly relevant to the reported issue of visibility not being correctly set in 3D plots.",

To identify the relevant code spans, I first looked into the current file context which contains the `Axes3D` class in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py`, especially focusing on the `set_visible` method. There isn't a `set_visible` method directly in `Axes3D`, so I need to look into the base class `Axes`. The search results include various files, but I'm particularly interested in the `Axes` class in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` and `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` which might contain the `set_visible` method for `Axes`. Additionally, `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py` and `lib/mpl_toolkits/axisartist/axislines.py` are also checked since they inherit from `Axes` and might have overridden the `set_visible` method. After analyzing these files, I found that the `set_visible` method for `Axes` is indeed in `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` which impacts the visibility of the artists. This method should be the one responsible for handling the visibility of the 3D subplot. Therefore, I conclude that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",
