Given the nature of the problem, it is likely related to the implementation of the set_visible method or the behavior of the axes in a 3D projection context. The provided files and code snippets indicate that the set_visible method might be defined or overridden in the Axes3D class in the 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py' file. Additionally, the 'lib/mpl_toolkits/axisartist/axislines.py' file contains a similar grid method that uses the visible parameter, which might also influence or be related to the set_visible behavior. Therefore, a targeted search in these specific files for the set_visible method and any related functionality is warranted.",

However, a direct method `set_visible` is not found in the provided search results.

The user expects that setting `set_visible(False)` should make the subplot not visible, but this is not happening. The analysis of the provided code spans and their relation to the issue is as follows:\n\n1. **Axes3D Class Initialization (`__init__`)**: This includes the setup of the 3D axes, including the initial view angles and projection type. However, this section does not directly deal with the visibility settings.\n2. **set_axis_off and set_axis_on Methods**: These methods control the visibility of the axis. Specifically, `set_axis_off` sets `_axis3don` to `False`, and `set_axis_on` sets it to `True`. This could be related to the visibility issue since it deals with internal state variables set but does not directly manipulate `_visible`.\n3. **draw Method**: This method handles the drawing of the 3D axes, including the visibility of panes and axes. It contains a check for `_axis3don` to determine whether to draw the axes, which indicates that controlling `_axis3don`, among others, should influence the visibility settings. The `set_visible` method does not explicitly appear in the provided code.\n4. **Axes Class Initialization and Methods in `axislines.py`**: These cover general Axes functionality but do not directly pertain to the visibility issue in a 3D context.\n\nBased on the analysis, the key spans of code relevant to investigating and potentially fixing the visibility issue are those in the `Axes3D` class that deal with axis visibility and drawing, particularly the `set_axis_off` and `set_axis_on` methods, and the initialization method. These sections, while not directly addressing `set_visible`, interact closely with the display of the 3D axes, and modifications or additions around these areas might resolve the user's reported issue. Thus, we should mark these relevant identified spans as pointing toward the logic that *could lead to* such an issue rather than solving it directly.",

This discrepancy might be due to the specific handling required for 3D elements in Matplotlib, emphasizing the need for a deep understanding of the interaction between 3D projections and the visibility control methods.
