            "scratch_pad": "In reviewing the reported issue and the provided file context, it's apparent that the focus is on the 'set_visible' function not working as expected in a 3D projection setting with the value set to False. The initial context provided references the 'Artist' class definition within 'matplotlib/artist.py', which includes the 'set_visible' method. This method directly sets the '_visible' attribute to the input value 'b' and marks the artist as stale, which should theoretically affect the visibility. However, the issue specifically relates to the behavior within 'Axes3D', extending from the base 'Axes' class in 'mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py'. \n\nReviewing the new search results, we see further implementations of 'set_visible' within other classes extending 'Artist' or related to selecting and widget functionalities. These include '_SelectorWidget', 'ToolLineHandles', 'ToolHandles', and 'SimpleAxisArtist', all of which have their versions of 'set_visible'. Notably, these implementations involve setting visibility for collections of artists or specific graphical elements, which could indicate that the visibility control is spread across multiple classes handling different UI or interactive components. \n\nGiven the specificity of the issue to 3D axes and not general Artist visibility, it would be beneficial to focus primarily on the 'Axes3D' class and any interactions it might have with inherited or associated classes related to visibility. The existing context and the new search results don't directly address why the 'set_visible' method in 'Axes3D' might not be working as expected when attempting to hide the 3D axis. However, the broader visibility handling observed in other classes suggests a possible complexity or customization when managing visibility in interactive plots or specific plot types like 3D. \n\nSo far, the search results do not include additional code related to any potential overrides or special handling of 'set_visible' specifically for 3D plots, which could be key to resolving the issue. Future searches or deeper exploration within the 'Axes3D' class definition and related methods may be necessary to uncover potential settings or conditions affecting visibility that are not captured in these code spans.",
