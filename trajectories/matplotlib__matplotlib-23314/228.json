The code provided demonstrates that the subplot remains visible even after setting `set_visible(False)`. From the search results, several files and code spans appear relevant to the issue at hand. Notably, the `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` file contains the `set_visible` method within the `Artist` class, which might be the base implementation for the 'set_visible' functionality. Additionally, the `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` file contains implementations of 'set_visible' within `_SelectorWidget` and its subclasses, possibly related to interactive widgets and their visibility settings. Despite these relevant findings, it seems crucial to also inspect any potential implementations or overrides of 'set_visible' within the context of 3D projections, particularly in files like `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` or `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py`, to ensure a comprehensive understanding and resolution of the issue. For now, focusing on the core implementations of 'set_visible' in the `Artist` class and possibly within widget interactions seems prudent to investigate further.",

I need to identify the relevant code spans in the search results that address this issue. The initial context includes a relevant span in 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py' for the Artist class's set_visible() method. Upon reviewing the new search results, I find that 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py' contains the Axes3D class, which is pertinent because it involves 3D projection handling. Additionally, the SimpleAxisArtist class in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/mpl_axes.py' also has a set_visible() method, which might be relevant if it interacts with 3D axes. Both of these new classes and their methods could contain the logic to resolve or understand the bug in the set_visible() functionality for 3D plots.
