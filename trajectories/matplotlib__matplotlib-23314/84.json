The issue explicitly mentions using 'set_visible(False)' which should make the subplot invisible but doesn't. My search was aimed at finding code related to 3D axes and visibility settings. I reviewed the code spans provided in the search results from various files including 'artist.py', 'axes3d.py', and 'axis3d.py'. The key relevance criterion was the presence of 'set_visible' methods and their implementation specifically in the context of 3D axes. The 'Artist.set_visible' method in 'artist.py' is foundational to visibility handling in Matplotlib and is directly connected to the issue as it is the parent class for all artists in the library, including axes. The 'Axes3D.__init__' in 'axes3d.py' and 'Axis.__init__' in 'axis3d.py' were analyzed for how they initialize 3D axes, potentially affecting visibility. However, the core method related to the issue is 'Artist.set_visible' in 'artist.py' as it explicitly defines how the visibility is set for artists, which could include 3D axes. This method sets the '_visible' attribute, influencing the artist's visibility directly. This directly addresses the problem reported by controlling the visibility of the elements, including 3D subplots. Therefore, the identified span in 'artist.py' under the 'set_visible' method is the most relevant to the reported issue.",

The context highlights how visibility is set and managed within the broader framework of the library. This is key for diagnosing why the visibility might not be updating as expected in 3D contexts.
