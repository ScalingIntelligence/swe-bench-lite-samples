This method is already found in the Django admin site implementation, which aligns with the requirement to modify the app_list for custom admin view purposes. The method _build_app_dict constructs the dictionary of models, which seems pertinent to the reported issue, as it deals directly with model classes (e.g., 'model_dict' includes 'object_name' which is the model class). Therefore, the relevant code spans involve the entire method, including its signature and body, as well as any necessary imports or initializations, especially those in the AdminSite class and its instantiation where the _build_app_dict method is defined and used. The provided search results are already closely related to the issue, as they include the definitions of the AdminSite class and the _build_app_dict method, likely pointing towards a foundation modification that corresponds directly with the intentions expressed in the issue.",
