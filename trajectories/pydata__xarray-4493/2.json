            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the behavior of `DataSet.update` and the preservation of dask chunking when updating a dataset. There are two specific problems mentioned: 1. 'DataSet.update' causes a chunked dask DataArray to evaluate its values eagerly, which means the DataArray is no longer chunked after the update. 2. Creating a Dataset with a DataArray triggers computation on the dask array, converting it to a numpy array. Given this, we should search for implementations of 'DataSet.update' and related methods within the 'xarray/core' directory, focusing on methods that handle chunking and updates. Additionally, we should look for any logic in the Dataset constructor that might force computation when a DataArray is added.",

The key elements to focus on here are the `DataSet.update` method and its handling of dask arrays within DataArrays.

In `xarray/core/dataset.py`, the `Dataset.update` method is defined, which calls `dataset_update_method`. This method could be the point where the eager evaluation might be happening. Additionally, there are spans in `xarray/core/merge.py` related to the `dataset_update_method`, indicating some processing when updating datasets. All these spans together provide a comprehensive view of how the `update` method is implemented and potentially where the eager evaluation might occur.\n\nMoreover, for the second part of the issue about the `Dataset` constructor causing computation, there is a span in `xarray/core/dataset.py` showing the `Dataset.__init__` method. This method initializes the Dataset object and includes the logic for combining data variables and coordinates, which might be relevant to the issue of computation triggered during initialization.\n\nThese spans, especially `Dataset.update`, `Dataset.__init__`, and `dataset_update_method`, are crucial for understanding the reported issue.

This suggests a problem within the `update` method or the underlying merge logic it uses. From the provided context, the `update` method in `xarray/core/dataset.py` calls `dataset_update_method` in `xarray/core/merge.py`. The latter function does some preprocessing and then calls `merge_core`. This chain of calls indicates that the logic for handling updates and merges could be the source of the issue. The new search results show additional content in `merge_core` and other supporting functions which might influence how DataArrays, particularly chunked DataArrays, are handled during updates. Specifically, it is worth noting the function `merge_collected` which is used to merge variables and indexes, and `_get_priority_vars_and_indexes` which sets priority for variables during merging. The code around these functions might be critical to ensuring that chunking properties of DataArrays are preserved during updates. Also, pay attention to how `coerce_pandas_values` and `deep_align` are used because these could inadvertently cause the chunking to be lost by converting a DataArray to a different type or by aligning it in a way that requires full evaluation of the chunks.",
