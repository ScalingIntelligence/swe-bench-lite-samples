Essentially, the DataArray loses its chunking after the update. This issue is critical for maintaining the lazy computation properties of dask. The provided search results contain the `xarray/core/dataset.py` file, which is relevant as it includes the definition of the `Dataset` class along with its `update` method. This file also contains the constructor and initial setup of the Dataset, which might be related to the problem if the initial setup interferes with the chunking status post-update. The `Dataset.__init__` span defines the initialization process, potentially influencing how data is handled with respect to chunking. Similarly, the `Dataset.update` span defines the update method itself, making it directly relevant to the issue since it describes the process by which existing Dataset objects are modified. Thus, these spans are directly related to the reported issue regarding the chunking status of DataArrays in Datasets.",
