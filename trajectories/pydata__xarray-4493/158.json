The main concern is that dask arrays are being converted to numpy arrays unexpectedly, which implies a loss of lazy evaluation and possibly increased memory usage. The focus should be on the chunking and lazy evaluation preservation in these operations, particularly in the Dataset and DataArray classes.",

This aligns with the observation that after using `DataSet.update`, the DataArray is no longer chunked as expected. The search results include relevant sections from `xarray/core/dataset.py` and `xarray/core/dataarray.py`. The `Dataset.update` method in `dataset.py` is of particular interest, as it calls `dataset_update_method`, which likely handles the actual update logic affecting chunking. The `chunk` method implementation in both `Dataset` and `DataArray` classes is also relevant, as it defines how chunking works. These pieces of code are crucial for understanding how chunking is managed and potentially why it might be lost during an update operation. However, the exact code span causing the issue might be deeper in the call stack, such as within `dataset_update_method` or related helper functions not directly included in the provided search results.",

The provided file context contains relevant spans like `Dataset.chunk` and `Dataset.update` in `xarray/core/dataset.py`.

The `Dataset.broadcast_equals` and `Dataset._calculate_binary_op` methods in the search results suggest broader functionalities related to dataset operations that might also influence the behavior related to chunking and updates. The DataArray class and its methods like `_to_temp_dataset` and `_from_temp_dataset` in `xarray/core/dataarray.py` are also relevant as they demonstrate how DataArrays might interact or transform into Datasets, which could be crucial for debugging the chunking issue during updates.

The `Dataset.update` method in `xarray/core/dataset.py`, which is the main focus of the issue.\n2. The `Dataset.chunk` method, which is used to handle chunking in the Dataset.\n3. The `Dataset.__init__` method, which constructs the Dataset and might be related to the issue of automatic computation when creating a Dataset.\n\nNew search results provide additional context:\n1.

The `_LocIndexer` class, which handles location-based indexing.\n\nAnalyzing these new results, the `Dataset.update` method seems to be the most relevant as it directly deals with updating the Dataset, which is the core of the issue.
