This suggests a problem with how the `update` method or related internal methods handle the chunking of DataArrays. The key function to inspect might be `Dataset.update`, which is expected to handle updates and maintain the chunking of the DataArrays. Additionally, understanding how `calculate_dimensions` and `Dataset.__init__` handle the input variables, especially with regards to their chunking, might also be relevant. Furthermore, the `DataArray.chunk` function might shed light on how chunking is supposed to work in the context of DataArrays.The search results provide access to relevant parts of the code in the xarray library. `Dataset.update` shows where updates are processed, and it might directly or indirectly affect the chunking states. `calculate_dimensions` could also be involved, as it determines how variables are mapped to dimensions, suggesting it might also handle aspects related to the forms of the DataArrays being processed. Finally, `DataArray.chunk` demonstrates how chunking is implemented from the perspective of a DataArray, outlining what chunked DataArrays should look like and how they should behave. Given this information, the relevant code spans to address the issue can be identified in the functions mentioned.",

Similarly, the constructor of `Dataset` involves logic that could affect chunking. In `xarray/core/merge.py`, `dataset_update_method` is implemented, which handles the merging of datasets. This method is crucial for understanding how updates might affect chunking. Given the presence of these core methods and their interactions, it seems likely that the provided file context has the necessary components to address the issues related to chunking and dataset updates.
