The first issue indicates that using `DataSet.update` on a chunked dask DataArray causes it to lose its chunking, which is unexpected. The second issue suggests that creating a Dataset with a DataArray and dimension names triggers computation, converting a dask array into a numpy array. Both issues involve chunking and computation handling in dask DataArrays within the xarray library. The relevant classes and methods to investigate include `Dataset`, `DataArray`, and their respective `chunk` and `update` methods. The search should focus on these methods to understand how chunking is managed and potentially identify where the chunking information might be lost or computations invoked unintentionally.",

For `DataArray`, the `__init__` method processes various inputs to construct the array, including data, coordinates, dimensions, name, and attributes. The method converts the data to a compatible format and infers coordinates and dimensions if they are not explicitly provided. Importantly, it uses `as_compatible_data` to ensure the data array is in a compatible format, which might implicitly trigger computations if the data is a dask array. For `Dataset`, the `chunk` method is of particular interest as it deals with chunking the dataset, which could be where chunking information is lost or computations are unwillingly triggered. The `update` method also warrants attention as it merges or updates variables, a process that might influence chunking or trigger eager computation.",
