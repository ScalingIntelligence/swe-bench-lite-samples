This involves modifying the `pytest_addoption` function to include a new short option (e.g., `-c`) that maps to the `--collect-only` functionality. All the files containing `pytest_addoption` and `pytest_cmdline_main` functions are examined to understand where this new option could be added without conflicts. No direct code for `--collect-only` is found in these sections, indicating that the current implementation does not support this feature, suggesting it could be an enhancement. Based on the analysis, it seems that the implementation for a one-character shortcut would ideally be added in the `src/_pytest/main.py` file where `pytest_addoption` is defined, as it already contains various options and could cleanly accommodate this new feature.",

This modification will solve the mapping issue without affecting the intended simplicity of using a single character as a shortcut for `--collectonly`. Ensure that the new option 'C' is correctly added under the correct group in the `pytest_addoption` function for proper functionality within pytest.\n\nThe new option 'C' needs to be added in the 'collect' group of the `pytest_addoption` function to differentiate it from the existing `-c`.
