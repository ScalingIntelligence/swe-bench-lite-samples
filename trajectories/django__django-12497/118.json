            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the incorrect hint in Django when dealing with recursive relationships involving more than two ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field without setting through_fields. The issue specifically points out that the hint incorrectly suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are actually m2m field arguments and not ForeignKey arguments. This seems to stem from a confusion where the developer likely thought of ManyToManyField but mistakenly typed ForeignKey. Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' is mentioned as outdated for Django 3.0 and above.\n\nLooking through the search results, I can identify several relevant code spans that directly address the construction and validation of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField relationships in Django. The spans related to ForeignKey initialization ('ForeignKey.__init__'), validation ('ForeignKey.check'), and the ManyToManyField initialization ('ManyToManyField.__init__') and its validation ('ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model') are particularly relevant. These sections of code provide insights into how Django handles these relationships and the potential for error or incorrect hinting in the documentation.\n\nSpecifically, the 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model' span contains the logic that checks for the misconfiguration and raises an appropriate error, including the hinted message about recursive relationships. This hints at the exact location where the incorrect message might be generated. It appears that the hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey for a recursive relationship due to a mistaken belief that many-to-many relationships should use ForeignKey, which is a misinterpretation and reflects directly the issue reported.\n\nTherefore, I have identified the relevant code spans that deal with the creation and validation of these fields in the Django ORM, specifically focusing on the areas where the error or hint might originate.",
