The hint suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' as ForeignKey arguments, which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. The relevant code spans should involve the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey field types, as well as the handling of through models and how hints are generated for these cases.\n\nThe search results include multiple code spans from django/db/models/base.py indicating the implementation and checking mechanisms for models, fields, and constraints. Notably, there are spans for 'Model._check_fields', 'Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship', and 'Model._check_field_name_clashes', which seem relevant to the issue at hand, as they involve checking field configurations and handling relationships like m2m or ForeignKey. \n\nAdditionally, 'Model.check' is a class method looking at different checks for models, including fields and relationships, this method could be the entry point for the code that handles generating or issuing the hint in question. \n\nBased on the issue description and the content of the search results, the relevant code spans to focus on would be those that directly involve the checking of fields and relationships like ManyToManyField or ForeignKey, especially those that handle the case of an intermediary model with multiple foreign keys without specified through_fields.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
