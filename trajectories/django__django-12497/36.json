The need to define 'symmetrical=False' was also outdated and not required since Django 3.0. From the provided context, it seems relevant to search for references to recursive relationships in ManyToManyField. Additionally, we should check for any usage of ForeignKey where ManyToManyField should be, specifically focusing on models that could handle m2m fields and their related functionalities.",

The codebase search results contain several relevant code spans in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file, specifically related to ForeignKey, OneToOneField, and ManyToManyField classes, which are directly related to handling model relationships in Django.\n\nThe 'ManyToManyField' section is particularly relevant because it handles many-to-many relationships, including the initialization of such fields with parameters like 'to', 'related_name', 'related_query_name', 'limit_choices_to', 'symmetrical', 'through', 'through_fields', 'db_constraint', and 'db_table'. The initialization logic correctly validates these parameters, which suggests the intended correction should be targeted at the specific incorrect hint in the '_check_relationship_model' method where the relationship model is checked. This method contains logic that could misleadingly suggest using ForeignKey for recursive relations.\n\nTherefore, the identified relevant code spans are within the 'ManyToManyField' class, specifically the '__init__' method for context on how these fields are instantiated, and the '_check_relationship_model' method where the incorrect hint is currently present.",

I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
