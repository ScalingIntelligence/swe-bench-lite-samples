The hint suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. There are also mentions of deprecated 'symmetrical=False' and the need to identify the relevant code spans for potential corrections.\n\nIn the search results, the file `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is very relevant. It contains code spans defining `ManyToManyField`, `ForeignKey`, and `ForeignObject` classes, which are directly involved in the reported issue. Notably, the `ManyToManyField` class includes attributes and methods related to recursive relationships and intermediary models. The `ForeignKey` class also appears, but it's the `ManyToManyField` parts that are crucial since they handle the functionality in question.\n\nThe file `django/db/models/base.py` appears to have a method `_check_m2m_through_same_relationship` in the `Model` class that checks for duplicate many-to-many relationships through an intermediary model. While this method is related to many-to-many relationships, it doesn't seem directly connected to the specific issue of the incorrect error hint.\n\nBased on the analysis of the search results, the relevant code spans are located in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file. The spans 'ManyToManyField.__init__', 'ManyToManyField.check', 'ManyToManyField._check_unique', 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model', 'ManyToManyField._get_path_info', 'ManyToManyField.get_path_info', 'ManyToManyField.get_reverse_path_info', 'ManyToManyField._get_m2m_db_table', and 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class' all pertain to the handling of many-to-many relationships, including recursive ones and the use of intermediary models.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
