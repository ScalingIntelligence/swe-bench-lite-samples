Specifically, the hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical=False, through=\"\"', which is incorrect as 'symmetrical' and 'through' are keywords for ManyToManyField, not ForeignKey. The search should focus on the ManyToManyField implementation and any related error-handling or hint-providing functions. Additionally, the issue also notes that 'symmetrical=False' is not required since Django 3.0, so the search should also consider updates around handling recursive relationships in ManyToManyFields.",

Specifically, the issue points out incorrect hints given by Django when setting up recursive relationships without properly using ManyToManyField. The reported issue mentions the need to identify and correct the hint stating 'If you want to create a recursive relationship, use ForeignKey(... symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'. The correct approach would involve using ManyToManyField, not ForeignKey, and proper settings for a recursive relationship. The provided search results include code spans from 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', which contains the definitions for ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes. The relevant code spans extracted from these classes include the definition of ForeignKey class, the ManyToManyField class, and its __init__ method, which contains initialization for related models and their behavior. Other relevant code spans include the ManyToManyField's _check_relationship_model method, which performs checks on the relationship models and might be involved in raising the incorrect hint. Also, the ForeignKey class's methods, such as db_type, db_parameters, and get_reverse_path_info, could be relevant as they could indirectly be impacted by or impact the incorrect hint given. These code spans seem relevant to understanding and correcting the reported issue, considering their relationship with howForeignKey and ManyToManyField interact during the setup and maintenance of recursive relations.",
