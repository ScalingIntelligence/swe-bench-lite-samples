The hint incorrectly suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments with ForeignKey, which are actually arguments for ManyToManyField. This error might occur in the code related to handling many-to-many relationships and hint generation. We should focus the search on the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes in the related.py file and any related functions or methods that handle error hints and relationship definitions.",

The initial span 'RelatedField' is a general class for related fields, but it doesn't directly handle the hint message issue. The 'ForeignKey' class was found to be directly related to the issue, particularly in the spans 'ForeignKey.deconstruct' and 'ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields', as they concern the ForeignKey field's properties and relationships. The 'ManyToManyField' class was also relevant, especially in the spans 'ManyToManyField.__init__' and 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class', as they deal with initializing and class contribution of ManyToManyField, including handling the symmetrical attribute. The code spans in question correctly diagnose the mistake in the hint message related to the differences in keyword arguments between ForeignKey and ManyToManyField. However, these spans do not directly contain the specific hint text mentioned in the issue. Further investigation into the specific hint generation code is needed.",

Specifically, the hint suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' as ForeignKey keyword arguments, which are actually ManyToManyField keyword arguments. The issue also points out that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships with an intermediary model to self, not required since Django 3.0.\n\nFirst, I reviewed the current file context provided in the <file_context> tag. It includes definitions for ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, and related methods such as create_many_to_many_intermediary_model. These definitions are crucial as they provide the foundational understanding of how these fields are defined and how they interact within Django's ORM.\n\nNext, I analyzed each code span in the <search_results> tag. The spans include multiple methods such as contribute_to_class, to_python, deconstruct, check, formfield, and various properties relevant to both ForeignKey and ManyToManyField. These spans are evaluated based on their relevance to the reported issue.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- The span 'ForeignObject.contribute_to_class' and 'ForeignKey.contribute_to_class' are relevant as they deal with how the fields contribute to class definitions.\n- The span 'ManyToManyField.__init__' is relevant as it initializes ManyToManyField instances, which should be correctly checked against the reported issue.\n- The span 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class' is also relevant as it contributes to the class definition, potentially linking back to the issue reported.\n\nThese spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue because they directly involve the management and handling of ManyToMany relationships, which are central to the issue being addressed.",
