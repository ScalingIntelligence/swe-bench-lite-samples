The hint incorrectly suggests using 'symmetrical=False' and 'through' as ForeignKey arguments, which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. The focus should be on the ManyToManyField and the recursive relationship functionality. The correct approach is to investigate the ManyToManyField class and related methods in the Django source code, specifically where recursive relationships might be handled. Given the provided context, the focus should be on the 'ManyToManyField' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and the 'ManyToManyDescriptor' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py' as these are likely places where this hint could be originating or impacting.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to a misinterpretation in the hint provided by Django when dealing with multiple ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a ManyToManyField. The hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' parameters, which are specific to ManyToManyField and not ForeignKey. The issue is further complicated by the mention of 'symmetrical=False', which is outdated for Django versions 3.0 and above.\n\nGiven this context, the primary focus should be on revisiting the ManyToManyField class to correct the hint and ensure it correctly reflects the requirements for setting up recursive relationships. The search results provided include several relevant code spans within the ManyToManyField class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'. These spans cover key parts of the ManyToManyField's functionality, such as its initialization, checking mechanisms, and relationship model handling.\n\nThe __init__ method of ManyToManyField appears particularly relevant as it includes parameters like 'symmetrical' and 'through', which are central to the issue. Additionally, methods like _check_relationship_model may also be pertinent as they handle the validation and setup of the intermediary models used in ManyToMany relationships. The provided code spans thus offer a foundation to modify or enhance the ManyToManyField to address the issue accurately.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are sufficient to start addressing the issue reported. Further modifications and checks would be needed in the actual implementation to ensure the hint is corrected and complies with current Django standards.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
