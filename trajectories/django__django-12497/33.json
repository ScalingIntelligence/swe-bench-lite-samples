To address this, we need to investigate the `ManyToManyField` class and its related methods. The search results show relevant code spans in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, particularly the `ManyToManyField` class definition and its initialization method (`ManyToManyField.__init__`). This method is crucial as it handles the initialization of many-to-many relationships, including recursive ones, and sets parameters like `symmetrical` and `through`. Observing how these are initialized and used within the method will provide insights into the current handling of recursive relationships. Additionally, the method `_check_relationship_model` in the same class could be relevant since it checks the relationship model and may reveal how Django currently handles issues with recursive relationships. The search results also include a method in `Model` class (`Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship`) from `django/db/models/base.py`, which checks for identical many-to-many relationships through an intermediary model. This might indirectly relate to the recursive relationship issue if multiple identical relationships can cause confusion. The code span `create_forward_many_to_many_manager` from `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` initializes the manager for many-to-many relations, which might not directly address the reported issue but helps in understanding how Django manages these relationships internally.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
