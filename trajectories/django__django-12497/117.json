            "scratch_pad": "Regarding the reported issue of incorrect hint about recursive relationships, particularly the misinformation regarding the use of 'symmetrical' and 'through' as ForeignKey arguments, it's evident that the root of the confusion lies in the ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes. The suggestion to use 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical' and 'through' keywords is incorrect as these are specific to ManyToManyField. The search results provide a deep dive into the Django source code for these fields, highlighting the initializations and functions that could contribute to this error or be potential areas for correction. The reported issue is particularly relevant around the initialization of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField, especially since the 'symmetrical' argument is being incorrectly mentioned in the context of ForeignKey, which does not use it. Also, the 'through' argument, meant for specifying a custom intermediary model for ManyToManyField relationships, is incorrectly suggested for ForeignKey. These misapplications should be corrected by concentrating on how these fields are instantiated and documented to avoid generating misleading hints, such as the ones mentioned in the report.\n\nKey areas to focus on in the search results are:\n- The initialization of ForeignKey (span id: 'ForeignKey.__init__'), which currently does not handle 'symmetrical' or 'through' arguments but might have been mistakenly thought to use them, leading to the reported hint.\n- The ManyToManyField initialization (span id: 'ManyToManyField.__init__') does handle 'symmetrical' and 'through', so ensuring that these field-specific arguments are not incorrectly referenced or suggested in other types of fields like ForeignKey is crucial.\n- The Recursive_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT ('self') is consistently used across both types of fields, indicating its importance and perhaps a place to standardize proper usage and hinting.\n- Overall, by thoroughly understanding how these fields are defined and instantiated, we can prevent incorrect suggestions in error messages and ensure that developers receive accurate guidance when setting up database relationships in Django.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
