The hint suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' with ForeignKey, which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. Furthermore, 'symmetrical=False' is mentioned as outdated for recursive relationships. The goal is to identify relevant code spans that involve ForeignKey and ManyToManyField definitions, and especially those that deal with the hint generation for recursive relationships. In the provided search results, several code spans are relevant:\n\n- The imports section brings in necessary modules and functions, setting up the environment for defining fields and relationships.\n- The 'ForeignKey' class definition contains methods and properties specific to how ForeignKey fields are handled in Django models.\n- The 'ManyToManyField' class definition encapsulates the logic for handling many-to-many relationships, including handling of 'through' models, 'symmetrical' relationships, and constraint management.\n- The '__init__' method of 'ManyToManyField' is particularly relevant as it initializes the field, setting up how other models relate to it and handling 'symmetrical' and 'through' parameters.\n\nThese code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue as they contain the logic for defining and handling fields that are central to the error mentioned in the issue. They also provide the groundwork for potential modifications needed to correct the mistaken hint about recursive relationships.",

The hint incorrectly suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments with ForeignKey, which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. The current file context provided shows the implementation of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes in Django's models. The search results include the '__init__' methods of both ForeignKey and ManyToManyField, which are relevant because they define how these fields are instantiated and what arguments they accept. Additionally, the ManyToManyField's '_check_relationship_model' method is relevant because it includes the code where the incorrect hint is likely being generated, suggesting the use of 'symmetrical' and 'through' with ForeignKey. This method needs to be corrected to reflect the proper usage for recursive ManyToMany relationships. The 'ForeignKey.check' and 'ManyToManyField.check' methods are also relevant as they involve validation checks that might hint at such issues. The identified code spans are thus crucial for understanding and correcting the reported issue related to recursive relationship handling in Django models.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
