The hint incorrectly mentions keywords `symmetrical` and `through` as arguments for `ForeignKey` instead of `ManyToManyField`. This error might be located in the part of the code where such hints are generated or where the recursive relationship logic is handled. The `RelatedField`, `ForeignKey`, and `ManyToManyField` classes in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` seem particularly relevant because they deal directly with these types of relationships and might contain the hint logic. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` and its specific implementation for SQLite in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` could be involved in how these relationships are managed in the database schema. Focusing on these areas should help locate the incorrect hint and other parts of the code that deal with recursive relationships.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
