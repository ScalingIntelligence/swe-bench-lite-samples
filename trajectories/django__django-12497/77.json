The hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical' and 'through', which are incorrect for ManyToManyField. The analysis suggests that the original developer likely meant ManyToManyField but mistakenly typed ForeignKey. Additionally, 'symmetrical=False' is an outdated requirement for recursive relationships. The relevant files and code snippets provided suggest looking into the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes and their methods to identify where the incorrect hint might be originating from.",

Specifically, the hint suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. Additionally, 'symmetrical=False' is mentioned as no longer required since Django 3.0.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase where the hint is generated or where the ManyToManyField's intermediary model is checked. The search results provide several files from Django's `django/db/models/` module, with spans containing many of the classes and methods relevant to this issue.\n\n1. **django/db/models/base.py**:\n   - Several spans in the `Model` class, including `Model.check`, `Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship`, and various other `_check_*` methods. These are likely candidates for where the model's fields, including ManyToManyFields, are checked.\n\n2. **django/db/models/fields/related.py**:\n   - Spans include `ManyToManyField`, `ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model`, and `ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class`. These are directly related to the ManyToManyField class and its handling of intermediate models and recursive relationships.\n\n3. **django/db/models/fields/__init__.py**:\n   - Contains the base `Field` class and its subclasses, though none of the spans here seem directly related to the specific issue at hand.\n\nBased on these observations, the most relevant spans are those in `django/db/models/base.py` that deal with checking the model's fields and especially those related to ManyToManyFields and intermediary models, and in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` that deal directly with the ManyToManyField class and its handling of recursive relationships.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that the search results have provided relevant code spans needed to identify and possibly correct the hint about recursive relationships in ManyToManyFields with intermediary models in Django.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
