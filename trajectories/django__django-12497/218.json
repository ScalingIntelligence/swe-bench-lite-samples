The hint incorrectly suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' as ForeignKey arguments when they are actually ManyToManyField arguments.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
