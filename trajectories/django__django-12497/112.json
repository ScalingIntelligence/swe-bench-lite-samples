The hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' keyword arguments, which are actually for ManyToManyField. The 'symmetrical=False' argument is also outdated for recursive relationships with an intermediary model to self since Django 3.0. This issue likely resides in the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey class definitions or their related hint generation logic.

Specifically, the 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model' span contains the hint in question, suggesting that it needs to be corrected. The 'ManyToManyField.__init__' span is also relevant as it initializes the ManyToManyField and handles the symmetrical and through parameters, which are key to the issue. Additionally, the 'ManyToManyField.check' and 'ManyToManyField._check_unique' spans are relevant for understanding the validation and error checking mechanisms associated with ManyToManyFields. The 'Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship' span in 'base.py' is also relevant for checking redundant many-to-many relationships through the same intermediary model, which can be related to configuring recursive relationships correctly.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
