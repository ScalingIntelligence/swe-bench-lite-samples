The hint mistakenly suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are keywords for ManyToManyField and not ForeignKey. The issue also notes that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships involving intermediary models since Django 3.0.\n\nTo address this, we need to focus on the 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField' classes within the Django codebase, particularly where they handle recursive relationships and the generation of hints.\n\nThe search results provide a detailed view of the 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField' classes, including their initialization, deconstruction, and handling of recursive relationships. The spans of code that are particularly relevant include:\n\n1. The initialization of 'ManyToManyField' (__init__) where the 'symmetrical' parameter is set.\n2. The deconstruct method of 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField', which is responsible for serializing the field configuration.\n3. The 'contribute_to_class' method of 'ManyToManyField' where the 'related_name' is set for recursive relationships.\n\nBased on these code spans, we can identify the relevant sections that might need corrections to address the issue with the hint about recursive relationships.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
