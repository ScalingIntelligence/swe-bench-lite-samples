The task is to identify relevant code spans that deal with ManyToManyField definition, especially those related to recursive relationships and intermediary models.

The ManyToManyField class is particularly relevant as it deals with the parameters 'symmetrical' and 'through', which are at the core of the issue. The '_check_relationship_model' method in ManyToManyField class contains the problematic hint message.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
