The hint incorrectly mentions 'symmetrical' and 'through' as ForeignKey arguments, when they are for ManyToManyField. The investigation should focus on the ManyToManyField class in the context of handling intermediary models and recursive relationships, as well as related checks and error messages.",

The hint in question erroneously suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through' which are arguments meant for ManyToManyField. Furthermore, the 'symmetrical=False' argument is considered outdated for recursive relationships with intermediary models since Django 3.0.\n\nUpon examining the provided search results from 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', several relevant code spans are identified that are directly related to ManyToManyField handling, specifically in regards to recursive relationships and intermediary models. The '__init__' method of ManyToManyField initializes the field, including handling of recursive relationships by setting 'symmetrical' to True when 'to' is set to 'self'. Additionally, the 'contribute_to_class' method manages the related name for symmetrical relationships, which is crucial for recursive relationships.\n\nThese findings align with the reported issue as they pertain to the correct implementation and handling of recursive ManyToMany relationships in Django, addressing the confusion between ForeignKey and ManyToManyField arguments and updating the handling of symmetrical relationships for recursive m2m fields. Thus, the identified code spans are relevant to planning and implementing the proposed correction in the PR.",

  "initial_message": "Wrong hint about recursive relationship.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)\n\t \nWhen there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:\nhint=(\n\t'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n\t'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\nBut 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.\nThis was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
