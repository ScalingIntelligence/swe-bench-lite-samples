To address this, I should focus the search on Django's model fields, specifically ManyToManyField and ForeignKey, and their related methods and checks. I'll also look into the create_many_to_many_intermediary_model function since it's related to the creation of intermediary models in m2m relationships.",

The task is to identify code spans that are relevant to this issue.\n\nI've analyzed the search results from the file 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'. Here are my findings:\n1. The 'ForeignKey' class definition, specifically the '__init__' method, deals with the initialization of ForeignKey relationships. This is potentially relevant as it involves setting up relationships and handling errors related to the ForeignKey setup.\n2. The 'ManyToManyField' class definition and its '__init__' method are directly related to the issue, as they handle the setup of ManyToMany relationships, including the 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments. This is where the incorrect hint would originate.\n3. The 'create_many_to_many_intermediary_model' function also relates to the setup of intermediary models for ManyToMany relationships, which is a key part of the issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those identified above.\n",

The presence of 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments in the ManyToManyField class supports the argument that these are related to ManyToManyField and not ForeignKey. Additionally, the create_many_to_many_intermediary_model function is relevant to creating intermediary models used in ManyToManyField relationships, which is directly related to the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "Wrong hint about recursive relationship.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)\n\t \nWhen there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:\nhint=(\n\t'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n\t'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\nBut 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.\nThis was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
