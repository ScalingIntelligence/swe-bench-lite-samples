The hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through', which are ManyToManyField arguments, not ForeignKey. This analysis will focus on identifying the relevant code spans that handle or relate to these specific issues within the search results. The main areas of interest are the definitions and behaviors of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField, along with their relationship management, especially concerning the message generation and handling of recursion through intermediary models.\n\nFirst, examining the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file, particularly the 'ManyToManyField.__init__' span, which initializes the ManyToManyField class. This class handles many-to-many relationships and checks for the 'symmetrical' attribute which may be incorrectly referenced or handled.\n\nSecondly, looking at the 'create_many_to_many_intermediary_model' function because it directly relates to the creation of intermediary models in many-to-many relationships. This function would be crucial for understanding how Django handles these relationships and potentially where any incorrect hints might originate.\n\nLastly, the 'ForeignKey' class definition in the same file could be relevant since the issue involves ForeignKeys. Despite ForeignKey not being the immediate focus of the correction needed, understanding its interaction with ManyToManyField through an intermediary model is essential.\n\nBased on the issue description and the initial context provided, these are the most relevant spans within the search results.",

It's possible that the hint generation is part of a broader error handling mechanism that integrates with the checks framework or another subsystem designed for validation. Further searches or a more nuanced approach to cataloging the Django source might be necessary to pinpoint this specific issue. This process could involve a deeper dive into the checks, validation, and possibly the admin or content type modules if they integrate with model field-specific checks and hints.",

The issue points out that the hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are arguments for ManyToManyField, not ForeignKey. The issue also mentions that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships in Django versions 3.0 and later.\n\nThe current file context has several relevant sections including the definitions of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField, as well as the method to create an intermediary model for many-to-many relationships. These sections provide a good base for understanding how Django handles these fields and relationships.\n\nIn the new search results, focus should be on any additional methods or classes related to ForeignKey and ManyToManyField definitions, as well as any administration checks or messages related to the hint provided in the error message. Specifically, the '_check_autocomplete_fields_item' method in 'BaseModelAdminChecks' contains checks related to fields, including many-to-many and foreign key fields, which could be relevant for understanding and potentially correcting the hint in question.\n\nThe identified spans are those from 'BaseModelAdminChecks._check_autocomplete_fields_item' as they pertain to validations of fields that are critical in the context of recursive relationships and intermediaries.

  "initial_message": "Wrong hint about recursive relationship.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)\n\t \nWhen there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:\nhint=(\n\t'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n\t'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\nBut 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.\nThis was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
