The hint wrongly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' keywords, which are actually for ManyToManyField and not required since Django 3.0. The relevant files are likely to be in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and possibly others. To narrow down the search, I will focus on the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes and related methods, as well as any hints about recursive relationships.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about a wrong hint in Django's ForeignKey documentation for recursive relationships. The hint suggests using 'symmetrical=False' and 'through' which are not valid arguments for ForeignKey. Instead, these arguments are relevant for ManyToManyField. This distinction is crucial for identifying the correct code spans.\n\n1. **ForeignKey and ManyToManyField Initialization**: Both ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes have __init__ methods that define how these fields are initialized. The ForeignKey.__init__ method does not handle 'symmetrical' or 'through' arguments, which aligns with the issue's description. The ManyToManyField.__init__ method, on the other hand, does handle these arguments. These methods are relevant because they directly relate to the creation of these fields and how arguments are processed.\n\n2. **Recursive Relationship Handling**: The issue mentions a need to correctly handle recursive relationships using the appropriate field type and arguments. The RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT is used in both ForeignKey and ManyToManyField to handle such relationships. Understanding how this constant is used can help pinpoint where the wrong hint might originate from.\n\n3. **Intermediary Model Creation**: The create_many_to_many_intermediary_model function is relevant as it constructs intermediary models for many-to-many relationships. Understanding how this function integrates with ForeignKey and ManyToManyField can provide context on how recursive relationships are managed.\n\n4. **Model Checking**: The Model class and its methods for checking various aspects of the model definition (like _check_fields, _check_m2m_through_same_relationship, etc.) are relevant to ensure that the model definition adheres to Django's conventions. These checks might catch issues related to incorrect usage of ForeignKey or ManyToManyField.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, we can identify the aspects of Django's models definition that need to be adjusted to correct the hint for recursive relationships and ensure the proper application of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField fields.\n\nBased on the analysis of the reported issue and the search results, the following code spans have been identified as relevant:\n\n- ForeignKey class initialization and parameters.\n- ManyToManyField class initialization focusing on how 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments are processed.\n- The use and handling of RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT in both ForeignKey and ManyToManyField.\n- Methods within the Model class that check for model integrity and consistency, especially those related to field clashes, unique constraints, and many-to-many relationships through intermediary models.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
