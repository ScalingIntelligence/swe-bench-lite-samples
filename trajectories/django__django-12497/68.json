The hint provided by Django suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' keyword arguments with ForeignKey, which is incorrect as these are ManyToManyField arguments. The focus should be on the ManyToManyField class and its related methods, especially those dealing with intermediary models and recursive relationships. The search should filter for files related to model fields and relationships in the Django framework.",

Particularly, the hint incorrectly mentions using ForeignKey with arguments 'symmetrical' and 'through', which are actually attributes of ManyToManyField. The issue also notes that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships with intermediary models since Django 3.0.\n\nIn the provided search results, the 'ManyToManyField' class and its methods in the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file are relevant to this issue. Specifically, the '__init__' method where the 'through' and 'symmetrical' parameters are processed and set. This is crucial as it directly involves the handling and initialization of ManyToManyField with these parameters which are central to the issue reported.\n\nThe analysis of the '__init__' method reveals how 'symmetrical' defaults to True if 'through' is not None, which aligns with the mistaken hint in the issue. Additionally, the 'contribute_to_class' method also deals with adding the ManyToManyField to the class, potentially addressing the recursive relationship aspect if not correctly managed.\n\nBased on the relevance of these methods and the alignment with the reported issue, I have identified 'ManyToManyField.__init__' and 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class' as the most relevant code spans.",

This class is crucial for handling many-to-many relationships and intermediary models in Django, which directly relates to the issue of setting up a recursive relationship incorrectly documented as using 'symmetrical' and 'through' with ForeignKey. The context also includes the `create_many_to_many_intermediary_model` function, which is relevant for creating intermediary models, and various other functions and classes that support the many-to-many relationship management in Django. The code snippet demonstrates that Django has built-in mechanisms to handle such relationships correctly without suggesting the use of incorrect field types or arguments. Based on this analysis, the relevant code context necessary to address the reported issue is present and sufficiently outlined.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
