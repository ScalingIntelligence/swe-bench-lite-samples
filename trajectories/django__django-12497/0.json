The user points out that 'symmetrical' and 'through' are ManyToManyField arguments, not ForeignKey arguments. To address this, one would need to correct the hint provided in the error message. The search results include several key sections of Django's related.py module, particularly focusing on the ForeignKey and ManyToManyField class definitions and their initialization methods. These sections are directly relevant as they deal with attribute definitions and the construction of relationships. Additionally, the 'resolve_relation' function is crucial for handling recursive relationships by resolving 'self' to the scope model. Overall, these pieces of code provide a clear understanding of how recursive relationships and foreign key fields are implemented in Django. They should be sufficient for correcting the hint about recursive relationships.",

  "initial_message": "Wrong hint about recursive relationship.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)\n\t \nWhen there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:\nhint=(\n\t'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n\t'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\nBut 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.\nThis was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
