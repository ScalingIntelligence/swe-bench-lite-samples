The class includes methods for checking and deconstructing the field, which could potentially be the source of the misleading hint. Furthermore, the ForeignKey class in the same file also has methods for checking and deconstructing fields, which might need adjustments if the issue is indeed related to ForeignKey handling in recursive relationships.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
