The hint provided incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are meant for ManyToManyField. This error implies the need to look into the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey implementation in Django's model field handling to understand how these are differentiated and how hints are generated. Additionally, focus should be on the management of hints and error messages in relation to these fields and recursive relationships.",

The issue aims to correct this hint to use ManyToManyField instead. \n\nThe search results include relevant sections of Django's source code, particularly the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes. The ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model span contains the problematic hint, suggesting the use of ForeignKey incorrectly. This section is crucial for understanding and correcting the error. The ManyToManyField.__init__ and ManyToManyField.check spans also provide context on how ManyToManyField is initialized and checked, which is relevant to understanding the recursive relationship functionality. \n\nAdditionally, the ForeignKey class and its initialization (__init__) are included, showing how ForeignKey is defined and used. This contrasts with ManyToManyField, emphasizing the distinctions necessary for correctly implementing a recursive relationship. \n\nBased on the reported issue and the context provided by the search results, the identified spans directly relate to the problem at hand.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
