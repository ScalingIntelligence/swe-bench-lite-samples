In the provided search results, the file 'django/db/models/base.py' contains relevant code spans under the 'Model' class for handling model checks and field initialization, which might include handling ManyToMany fields. Specifically, 'Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship' and 'Model.__init__' could be relevant for initializing fields and checking for recursive relationships. Additionally, the file 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py' contains definitions for 'ManyToManyRel' and its initialization, which is directly related to ManyToMany fields and their parameters, including 'through' and 'through_fields'. These spans are likely relevant to the reported issue as they involve the initialization and configuration of ManyToMany fields, especially those with intermediary models and recursive relationships.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
