Specifically, the hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are incorrect arguments for ForeignKey. Instead, it should reference ManyToManyField. \n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the definition of 'ManyToManyField' and its methods. These include the '__init__' method where the parameters like 'symmetrical', 'through', and others are defined and checked. Additionally, the 'contribute_to_class' method is relevant for how the field contributes to the class and handles the backwards relation. \n\nThe 'create_many_to_many_intermediary_model' function is also crucial as it shows how Django creates intermediary models for m2m relationships, which is directly related to the issue of setting through_fields and managing recursive relationships.\n\nThus, I have identified the relevant code spans that align with the reported issue.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
