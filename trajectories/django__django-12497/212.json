            "scratch_pad": "The issue pertains to a hint error in Django related to recursive relationships involving more than two ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a ManyToManyField. The hint incorrectly suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. The task is to locate relevant code snippets across Django's model, field, and related module files, focusing on the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes, as well as checking for any hints or messages where such an error might be originating. Since the issue explicitly mentions these arguments, it's crucial to thoroughly investigate the handling of these arguments within the ManyToManyField class definitions and possibly the deconstruct method, especially in files like 'related.py' or 'base.py'.",

The code spans related to ManyToManyField and ForeignKey in the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file are particularly relevant as they involve the definition and behavior of these fields when dealing with recursive relationships. The spans 'ManyToManyField.__init__' and 'ForeignKey.deconstruct' are particularly pertinent as they deal directly with the initialization and serialization of these fields, which is crucial for understanding how they can be modified to correct the hint in the error message. Additionally, the 'RelatedField', 'ForeignObject', and 'ForeignKey' class definitions provide useful context around how these fields operate within Django's ORM, though they don't directly deal with the incorrect hint issue. Overall, the identified spans provide a solid basis for addressing the reported issue, focusing on the correct initialization and behavior of ManyToManyField in recursive relationships.",
