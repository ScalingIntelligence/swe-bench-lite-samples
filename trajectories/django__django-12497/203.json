The hint incorrectly suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are actually meant for 'ManyToManyField'. The task is to identify relevant code spans related to handling recursive relationships, ForeignKey, and ManyToManyField. After analyzing the search results, several code spans appear relevant. These include the initialization of ManyToManyField, where the 'symmetrical' argument is handled, and the check for 'symmetrical' in the contribute_to_class method of ManyToManyField. Additionally, the ForeignKey class and its methods are relevant, particularly the resolve_related_fields method, which deals with the resolution of fields in relationships. These code spans are crucial for understanding how recursive relationships and the 'symmetrical' argument are managed in Django's ORM. It is important to ensure that the hint in the error message is corrected to accurately reflect the proper usage of ManyToManyField in recursive relationships.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to incorrect hints being shown for recursive relationships, specifically in the context of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField in Django. The issue raised is that Django's hint when encountering more than two ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field erroneously suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. Additionally, 'symmetrical=False' is not required for recursive relationships since Django 3.0.\n\nTo address this issue, it is crucial to identify the relevant parts of the Django source code that deal with ForeignKey and ManyToManyField, particularly in relation to recursive relationships and intermediary models. The provided context and search results are consistent with this need, showing definitions and methods related to these fields.\n\nMy analysis begins with examining the file contexts provided in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py'. The major focus is on how ForeignKey and ManyToManyField are defined and how they interact in scenarios involving recursive relationships and intermediary models. The preliminary file context confirms this relevance and lays the foundation for deeper analysis.\n\nNext, in the search results, we see the same file 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' but augmented with additional methods and less relevant parts omitted from the preliminary context. This widened view confirms the focus on ForeignKey and ManyToManyField, including namespaces, classes, and methods that could address the reported issue. The sections on '__init__' methods for both ForeignKey and ManyToManyField are crucial, showing how they handle arguments.\n\nMoreover, the 'contribute_to_class' and 'contribute_to_related_class' methods within ManyToManyField provide insight into how recursive relationships are handled and exposed in the model class. The outline provided by the search results does not detail additional checks like 'check', '_check_unique', '_check_relationship_model', and others not immediately critical to solving this issue, hence less relevant.\n\nThe dependency on intermediary models is further deduced from sections like 'get_path_info', '_get_m2m_db_table', and database alterations seen in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' and 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py' which, though essential for checking how many-to-many relationships are managed and altered, are pragmatically less essential for modifying the hint errors directly.\n\nSummarizing my thought process, the identified critical sections involve the '__init__' functions of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField along with the 'contribute_to_class' methods within 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'. These parts directly deal with the initialization and model integration for both types of fields, mandating special handling of recursive relationships as characterized by the reported issue.\n\nThe respective span_ids dominate my recommendation to indicate where the erroneous hint, specifically the misuse of arguments acceptable for ForeignKey in relation to recursive relationships and intermediary handling, most likely could reside. This nuanced understanding from the detailed examination provides clear insights on where interventions would principally adjust or rectify likely issues in Django's hints system for these relational fields.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the wrong hint Django provides when there are more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of an m2m field without setting through_fields. The hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through', which are inappropriate for ForeignKey. The issue also mentions that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships. My task is to identify relevant code spans that address this issue in the new search results, which means looking for the parts of code that involve m2m fields, ForeignKey fields, and recursive relationships. Here's how I do it: First, I look for those in the new search results that link to m2m or ForeignKey definition or usage as per the reported issue - i.e., django/db/models/fields/related.py#ManyToManyField and django/db/models/fields/related.py#ForeignKey might be pertinent. After scouring through various 'span_ids,' I pick out those code portions that deal with the computation or use of ManyToMany/ForeignKey fields as per the reported problem (like recursive relationships) from django/db/models/fields/related.py#ManyToManyField.__init__ and django/db/models/fields/related.py#ForeignKey.__init__ amongst others. However, since there are lots of irrelevant information, I focus on sectioning off the relevant ones from the irrelevant based on the issue at hand. Based on the given report and context, these entries will be the ones that directly deal with the setup of ManyToMany/ForeignKey fields or implement correct ways of recursive relationships. Notably, I choose only those that directly work on m2m and ForeignKey functionalities such as hint correction of recursive relationship (excluding general class definition and logistical mechanisms).

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
