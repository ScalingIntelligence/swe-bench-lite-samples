The hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' keywords, which are actually for ManyToManyField. To address this, I reviewed the code related to ManyToManyField and ForeignObject. The relevant code spans include the initialization of ManyToManyField (__init__) and the resolution of related fields in ForeignObject (resolve_related_fields), as they deal directly with setting up and handling relationships. Additionally, the check methods in ManyToManyField (_check_relationship_model, _check_unique) are crucial for understanding how relationships are validated, which could be where the hint error may have originated. The code in 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model' is particularly relevant as it deals with the validation of the intermediary model in ManyToMany relationships, which is directly related to the issue at hand regarding recursive relationships and the hint provided.",

            "scratch_pad": "The file context provided includes the relevant Django models and fields that are directly connected to the reported issue. Specifically, the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes are examined. The ManyToManyField class includes the logic for checking the number of foreign keys in the intermediary model and providing the error hint in question. The ForeignKey class also appears, indicating the relationship to ManyToManyField in terms of handling recursive relationships. The checks and the hint provided are directly related to the issue reported about incorrect hints for recursive relationships. Although the specific method that needs correction is not detailed, the context provided is enough to understand where and what to modify to fix the issue. Additional code outside of these classes might be needed to fully implement the correction, but the core file context is relevant and from it, one can determine the necessary changes.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
