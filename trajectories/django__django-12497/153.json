The hint incorrectly mentions arguments 'symmetrical' and 'through' as belonging to ForeignKey instead of ManyToManyField. This mistake suggests a mix-up in the usage of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField. The search should focus on the ManyToManyField class and its methods, particularly around the handling of intermediary models and the generation of error hints related to recursive relationships.",

The hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are actually parameters for ManyToManyField, not ForeignKey. Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' argument is outdated for Django versions 3.0 and later.\n\nThe search results focus on the 'ManyToManyField' class in the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file, which is relevant to the issue. The '__init__' method of 'ManyToManyField' is particularly relevant as it initializes the field and handles arguments like 'symmetrical' and 'through'. The class's 'check' method and its private methods ('_check_unique', '_check_ignored_options', '_check_relationship_model', '_check_table_uniqueness') are also relevant as they handle various checks and validations for the field, which could be where the incorrect hint might be generated or handled. The 'deconstruct' method and methods related to paths and attributes (like '_get_path_info', '_get_m2m_attr', '_get_m2m_reverse_attr') are also relevant for understanding the field's behavior and how it might interact with the hint mechanism.\n\nGiven this detailed review, the identified code spans are likely to be relevant to the reported issue, as they directly involve the ManyToManyField class and its handling of recursive relationships and intermediary models.",

  "initial_message": "Wrong hint about recursive relationship.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)\n\t \nWhen there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:\nhint=(\n\t'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n\t'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\nBut 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.\nThis was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
