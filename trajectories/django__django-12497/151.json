The developers noticed that the hints incorrectly mention 'ForeignKey' arguments like 'symmetrical' and 'through', which should only be used with ManyToMany fields. The issue suggests that these hints should be corrected to avoid confusion. After examining the search results, I identified several code spans as relevant to the issue. Specifically, the spans within the 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model' method contain checks related to recursive relationships and the handling of through models with more than two foreign keys. Additionally, the 'ManyToManyField.__init__' and 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class' methods are relevant as they handle the initialization and class contribution of the ManyToMany fields, respectively. These spans could be places where the erroneous hints mentioned in the issue are generated or handled. The other files and spans seem to be related to other aspects of ManyToMany fields and their relationships but are not directly tied to the specific issue of incorrect hints in error messages for recursive relationships.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
