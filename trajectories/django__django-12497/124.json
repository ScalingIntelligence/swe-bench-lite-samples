The hint incorrectly suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' keyword arguments with ForeignKey, whereas they are ManyToManyField arguments. Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' part is outdated for recursive relationships. The search should focus on Django's ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes and their related methods to find where the hint is generated and corrected.",

The '_check_relationship_model' method contains the logic for checking the relationship model and generating the hint mentioned in the issue. This section directly addresses the issue by including the hint message that is being reported as incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, 'django/db/models/base.py' contains the 'Model' class and its methods. Though less directly related to the hint issue, this file is relevant for understanding how models and their fields are managed and checked.\n\nLastly, 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py' includes the 'ManyToManyRel' class, which is relevant for understanding the reverse relationships for ManyToManyField.\n\nThe relevant code spans include the definition of the hint message in the '_check_relationship_model' method and the overall structure of how ManyToManyField and related classes are designed in Django's codebase.",

  "initial_message": "Wrong hint about recursive relationship.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)\n\t \nWhen there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:\nhint=(\n\t'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n\t'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\nBut 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.\nThis was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
