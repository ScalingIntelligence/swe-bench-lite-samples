The search results provided contain several relevant code spans, particularly those related to 'ForeignKey', 'ManyToManyField', and the error hint in 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model'. These spans are critical as they directly relate to the issue of recursive relationships and the generation of the incorrect hint. The spans identified include the definition of 'ForeignKey', 'ManyToManyField', and the method '_check_relationship_model' in 'ManyToManyField' where the incorrect hint is generated. These spans provide the necessary context and code to understand and potentially correct the hint generation logic.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
