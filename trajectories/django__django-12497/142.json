The hint suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are inappropriate for ForeignKey and are actually arguments for ManyToManyField. The issue also mentions that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships.\n\nUpon examining the provided search results, the relevant code spans are primarily found in the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file, specifically within the 'ManyToManyField' class and its associated methods. These methods include '_check_relationship_model', '__init__', and '_get_path_info', which handle the validation and setup of many-to-many relationships, including recursive relationships. The 'ForeignKey' class and its methods also play a role in understanding how foreign keys and many-to-many relationships are managed in Django's ORM. Additionally, the 'resolve_relation' function is relevant as it handles the resolution of model relationships, including recursive ones.\n\nThe code spans identified in the 'ManyToManyField' class and its methods are directly related to the issue at hand, as they contain the logic for checking and handling recursive relationships and the generation of error messages with the incorrect hint. Therefore, these code spans are clearly relevant to the reported issue concerning the incorrect hint for recursive relationships. It is also beneficial to identify the context in which 'ForeignKey' is used, although the primary focus should be on 'ManyToManyField' and its related methods. The 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py' file provides further context regarding the 'ManyToManyRel' class, which is used to define the related objects manager for many-to-many relationships.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
