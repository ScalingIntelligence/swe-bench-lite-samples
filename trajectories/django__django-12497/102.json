Specifically, 'ForeignKey.__init__', 'ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields', and 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model' likely contain the logic related to the recursive relationships and the keywords used in the hint message. The 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model' method seems particularly relevant due to its detailed checks related to intermediate models and recursive relationships.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
