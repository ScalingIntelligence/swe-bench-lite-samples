The specific problem is a misleading hint provided when no through_fields are set for such relationships. The hint incorrectly mentions ForeignKey arguments ('symmetrical' and 'through') instead of ManyToManyField arguments. Additionally, 'symmetrical=False' is mentioned as a requirement for recursive relationships, which is outdated and not required since Django 3.0. To address this issue, focus the search on Django's related module where ManyToManyField and ForeignKey fields are defined, specifically around the logic for recursive relationships and the error handling mechanisms.",

The issue points out that the hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are for ManyToManyField, not ForeignKey. The detailed analysis of the 'Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship' method reveals it directly addresses the scenario of checking for identical many-to-many relations through an intermediate model, which is highly relevant to the reported issue. This method ensures that when there are multiple ForeignKeys in the intermediary model, Django correctly identifies and handles the relationship, avoiding the error mentioned in the issue. Therefore, this method is crucial for addressing the incorrect hint about recursive relationships, and it aligns perfectly with the need to correct the hint in the error message.",

The hint incorrectly mentions using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through=', which is incorrect for ManyToMany fields. The relevant code spans should focus on the handling of ManyToMany fields, particularly the validation or error-checking logic related to these conditions.\n\nFrom the provided <file_context>, the method Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship is already identified as relevant, as it checks for multiple many-to-many relations through the same intermediary model. The additional search results do not contain further relevant methods that directly address the issue described in the <issue>.\n\nThus, based on the analysis, no new relevant code spans have been found in the <search_results>, and the potential correction for the hint in the ManyToMany field handling needs to be addressed with a new implementation or a modification within the context of the existing method Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship.",

The next logical step is to refocus the search on the broader scope of error handling and message generation specifically related to ManyToManyField and ForeignKey interactions during model validation. Since explicit searching hasn't yielded the desired results, it suggests that a more indirect route may be necessary to find where these specific hints are generated or inferred.",

Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' argument is outdated for Django versions 3.0 and later.\n\nThe <file_context> provides the `_check_m2m_through_same_relationship` method from `django/db/models/base.py`, which checks for duplicate many-to-many relationships through an intermediary model. This method could potentially be related to the issue, as it deals with many-to-many relationships and intermediate models.\n\nThe <search_results> include several files and code spans. Relevant files include: \n- `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`: Contains functions for checking models and lazy references, potentially relevant for identifying issues with model field configurations.\n- `django/core/checks/messages.py`: Defines the `CheckMessage` class, which handles diagnostic messages, including error messages related to misconfigurations.\n- `django/db/models/fields/related.py`: Contains the `ManyToManyField` class, which is directly related to the issue at hand. The class includes methods for initializing the field, checking the relationship model, and other related functionalities.\n\nKey spans from these files include:\n- `django/db/models/fields/related.py`: The `ManyToManyField` class and its methods, particularly `__init__`, `_check_relationship_model`, and `formfield`, which handle initialization, relationship model checking, and form field generation, respectively.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans should provide enough context to understand and potentially fix the issue related to the wrong hint about recursive relationships.",

Also included is the _check_m2m_through_same_relationship method, which checks for errors in defining many-to-many relationships through intermediary models, which is another part of the issue. Additionally, the model_checks.py file includes a check_all_models function that could involve running checks on models, which might encompass the check for recursive relationships. Overall, the context covers a significant portion of the logic and functionality that would be involved in addressing the reported issue about the wrong hint in recursive relationship scenarios involving many-to-many fields.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
