The hint suggests using 'ForeignKey(..., symmetrical=False, through=...)', which is incorrect as 'symmetrical' and 'through' are ManyToManyField arguments, not ForeignKey. The relevant code is likely to be found in the fields/related.py module where ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes are defined, and possibly in base.py concerning model checks and in schema.py for database schema operations. Also, related_descriptors.py for descriptor-related logic might be relevant.",

The hint suggests using the 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments with ForeignKey, which are actually arguments for ManyToManyField. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results to address this issue.\n\n1. **ManyToManyField Initialization**: The `ManyToManyField.__init__` span is relevant as it initializes the ManyToManyField with the parameters like `symmetrical` and `through`. The issue might involve correcting the initialization logic or the hint provided during error handling.\n\n2. **ManyToManyField Check Methods**: The `ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model` and `ManyToManyField._check_table_uniqueness` spans are relevant as they involve checks related to the ManyToManyField, which might include error handling and raising appropriate messages.\n\n3. **Model Check Methods**: The `Model.check` and `Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship` spans are relevant as they involve checking the model's fields and relationships, including ManyToManyFields.\n\n4. **Database Schema Editor**: The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._alter_many_to_many` and `DatabaseSchemaEditor._alter_many_to_many` spans are relevant as they involve altering the database schema for ManyToManyFields, which might involve handling recursive relationships.\n\nThese spans collectively cover the aspects of ManyToManyField initialization, validation, and database schema alterations, which are likely to be relevant to addressing the issue of the wrong hint about recursive relationships.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
