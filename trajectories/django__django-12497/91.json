            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to incorrect hints given by Django when dealing with recursive relationships involving more than two ForeignKeys in an intermediary model without specified 'through_fields'. The issue points out that the hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are arguments for 'ManyToManyField' rather than 'ForeignKey'. Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' argument is outdated for recursive relationships since Django 3.0.\n\nIn the provided search results, the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file contains both 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField' classes, which are relevant to the issue. The 'ForeignKey' class spans discuss various methods and properties related to foreign key operations, none of which directly address the hint issue described. However, the 'ManyToManyField' class spans are highly relevant, particularly the '__init__', 'check', '_check_relationship_model', and '_check_ignored_options' methods. These methods handle the initialization, validation checks, and error handling for ManyToMany relationships, including recursive relationships involving intermediary models.\n\nThe 'check' method in 'ManyToManyField' includes detailed checks for the correctness of the relationship, including handling of multiple ForeignKeys and the generation of appropriate error messages. The '_check_relationship_model' method is especially pertinent as it contains the logic that handles cases where there are more than two ForeignKeys in an intermediary model, potentially leading to the incorrect hint issue described. Additionally, the '_check_ignored_options' method also checks for misuse of certain options in 'ManyToManyField'.\n\nOverall, while no direct mention of the specific hint issue was found within 'ForeignKey' methods, the 'ManyToManyField' methods provide comprehensive handling of potential issues related to ManyToMany relationships, including those involving recursive relationships and intermediary models. This suggests that the resolution to the reported issue would likely involve modifying or enhancing these methods within the 'ManyToManyField' class.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
