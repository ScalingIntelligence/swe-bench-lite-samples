The hint suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments with ForeignKey, which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' part is mentioned as outdated for Django 3.0 and above.\n\nIn the search results, the file 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' contains the definition of the ManyToManyField class and its methods, including the __init__ method that initializes the field with parameters like 'symmetrical' and 'through'. This directly relates to the issue described, as the incorrect hint might stem from how these parameters are handled and documented. The __init__ method sets the 'symmetrical' attribute based on whether the relationship is recursive and handles the 'through' model appropriately. Therefore, these sections of code are highly relevant to addressing the issue of incorrect hints.\n\nGiven this analysis, the search for relevant code is likely complete, as the necessary code spans directly related to the handling of ManyToManyField and its parameters have been identified.",

The symmetrical argument is also noted as no longer required since Django 3.0 for recursive relationships.\n\nReviewing the provided file context and search results, there are several key components that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. The `ForeignKey` class: This is where the error message hint may be originating from, as it incorrectly mentions 'symmetrical' and 'through' as ForeignKey arguments.\n2. The `ManyToManyField` class: This is the correct field type for many-to-many relationships and includes the handling of the 'symmetrical' argument and 'through' model for intermediary tables.\n3. The `ManyToManyField.__init__` method: This method initializes the ManyToManyField and includes logic for handling the 'symmetrical' argument based on whether the relationship is recursive (i.e., to 'self').\n\nWith this analysis, the identified spans are relevant as they directly pertain to the foreign key and many-to-many field functionality, which is central to the reported issue.",

Additionally, 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships with an intermediary model since Django 3.0.\n\nI will analyze the search results to find relevant code spans that deal with recursive relationships, ManyToManyField, and ForeignKey. The key points to focus on are the initialization of these fields and the handling of their arguments, especially those related to recursive relationships.\n\nThe file context already provides relevant spans, particularly in the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes, focusing on their __init__ methods and how they handle arguments like 'symmetrical' and 'through'. The search results also include additional checks and contribution methods for ManyToManyField, which may also be relevant to the issue.\n\nI will extract spans that directly relate to the initialization and configuration of these fields, especially those handling recursive relationships.",

The issue reported is about incorrect hints for setting up recursive relationships in the context of m2m fields.

Additionally, the contribute_to_class method in ManyToManyField is crucial for integrating the field within Django's model system, potentially involved in generating the type of hints mentioned in the issue.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
