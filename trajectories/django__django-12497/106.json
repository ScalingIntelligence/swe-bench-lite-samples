In the 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' file, there are several relevant spans of code that could be related to the issue. These include the definition of 'ForeignKey', 'OneToOneField', and 'ManyToManyField', as well as their initialization and contribution to class methods.\n\nWith this in mind, the relevant code spans are those that define the 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField', specifically where the hints or default behaviors for recursive relationships are handled or could potentially be corrected.

  "initial_message": "Wrong hint about recursive relationship.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)\n\t \nWhen there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:\nhint=(\n\t'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n\t'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\nBut 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.\nThis was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
