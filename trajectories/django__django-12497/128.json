The hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through', which are ManyToManyField keyword arguments. The analysis of the search results shows that the relevant code spans are those related to ManyToManyField, ForeignKey, and OneToOneField, especially their initialization and deconstruction methods, as well as the contribute_to_class method. These spans are crucial for understanding and potentially correcting the hint provided in the error message. The code spans related to check and resolve related fields, such as _check_relationship_model and resolve_related_fields, are also relevant, as they might involve validations that lead to the hint being shown. Furthermore, the creation of intermediary models for many-to-many relations in the create_many_to_many_intermediary_model function is directly related to the issue, as it might lead to the detection of the problematic scenario and the erroneous hint deduction. It's important to note that while the actual manipulation of ForeignKey properties that pertain to recursive relationships is not directly seen, the identified spans provide enough context to discern where changes might be needed in the deconstruction methods, like ForeignKey.deconstruct, to correct the hint string. Additionally, since the symmetrical argument is mentioned specifically as being outdated, the ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class span should be reviewed to ensure old behaviors are not carrying forward in new relationships. Overall, the analysis of these spans should be sufficient to locate and adjust the code to correct the hint provided in the error message.",
