The hint incorrectly suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' as ForeignKey arguments, but they are ManyToManyField arguments. Need to find code in Django's ORM related to ManyToManyField and ForeignKey handling, with a focus on the hints and error messages provided when setting up recursive relationships. The `related.py`, `base.py`, and `reverse_related.py` files seem the most relevant as they contain classes and functions related to related fields, model base, and reverse relationships respectively. Also, look into the `schema.py` file as it deals with schema editing where many-to-many relationships might be altered.",

Specifically, the ManyToManyField class definition and its __init__ method are relevant as they deal with the initialization of ManyToManyFields, including handling arguments like 'symmetrical' and 'through'. Additionally, the ManyToManyRel class and its __init__ method are relevant as they handle the related side of ManyToManyFields, including the 'symmetrical' argument. The Model class's _check_m2m_through_same_relationship method is also relevant as it checks for many-to-many relationships through the same model, which is related to the issue of recursive relationships.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
