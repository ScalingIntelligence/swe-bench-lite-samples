The hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' keyword arguments, which are actually for ManyToManyField. The search should target the ManyToManyField class and its related methods where this hint might be generated or displayed. Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' argument is mentioned as an outdated requirement for recursive relationships with an intermediary model, so it's important to look for any usage or documentation of this argument in the context of ManyToManyFields.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on incorrect hints provided by Django regarding recursive relationships in ManyToManyField, specifically mentioning 'symmetrical' and 'through' as keyword arguments for ForeignKey rather than ManyToManyField. The issue also mentions that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for defining recursive relationships with intermediary models to self. To address this, relevant code spans from the ManyToManyField class in Django's related.py file are assessed. The '__init__' method of ManyToManyField is crucial as it deals with the initialization of many-to-many relationships, including handling 'symmetrical' and 'through' parameters correctly. The 'contribute_to_class' method is also relevant as it contributes field attributes to the model class, which includes managing symmetrical relationships for recursive self-referential models. These code spans need to be examined for potential corrections or updates to ensure the correct handling of recursive many-to-many relationships.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the incorrect hint provided when dealing with more than two ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a ManyToMany field without setting through_fields. Specifically, the hint incorrectly suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through', which are ManyToMany field arguments. The issue originates from mistakenly considering ManyToManyField while typing ForeignKey. Additionally, 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships involving intermediary models with self. The task is to correct this hint.\n\nIn the initial file context, the ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes are defined within django/db/models/fields/related.py. The ForeignKey class inherits from ForeignObject and has attributes like descriptor_class, many_to_many, many_to_one, one_to_many, one_to_one, rel_class, empty_strings_allowed, default_error_messages, and description.\n\nThe ManyToManyField class is also defined in the same file and includes attributes like many_to_many, many_to_one, one_to_many, one_to_one, rel_class, and description. The __init__ method of ManyToManyField is particularly relevant as it initializes these attributes, including handling symmetrical and through parameters.\n\nThe new search results include additional methods and attributes of the ManyToManyField class such as check, _check_unique, _check_ignored_options, _check_relationship_model, _check_table_uniqueness, deconstruct, _get_path_info, get_path_info, get_reverse_path_info, _get_m2m_db_table, _get_m2m_attr, _get_m2m_reverse_attr, contribute_to_class, contribute_to_related_class, set_attributes_from_rel, value_from_object, save_form_data, formfield, db_check, db_type, and db_parameters.\n\nRelevant code spans include the __init__ method of ManyToManyField for understanding how symmetrical and through parameters are handled. The contribute_to_class method is also relevant as it deals with the class contribution of the ManyToManyField. The deconstruct method helps in understanding how the field properties are reconstructed. The _get_path_info, get_path_info, and get_reverse_path_info methods are related to path information, which is crucial for understanding relationships. The _get_m2m_db_table method is important for database table generation, which is central to ManyToMany relationships. The contribute_to_related_class method is key for understanding how the ManyToManyField contributes to related classes. Finally, the formfield method is relevant for form handling, which is part of the user interface aspect related to ManyToMany fields.",

The hint incorrectly suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' with ForeignKey instead of ManyToManyField. To address this, we need to identify and correct the hint message and potentially related code constructs in Django's fields/related.py. Given the context, it's crucial to find the specific parts of the code that handle the hint message generation and the initialization of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField fields, especially those dealing with recursive relationships. \n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, several key areas are identified:\n1. 'ForeignKey.__init__' and 'ManyToManyField.__init__' which initialize these fields and set their parameters.\n2. 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class' which processes the field when contributing it to a model class.\n3. The general 'RelatedField' and 'ForeignObject' classes which 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField' inherit from.\n4. Related checks methods like 'ManyToManyField.check' and its sub-methods confirming field validity and potential issues.\n\nFrom the search results, we find updated versions of these key areas, confirming they cover relevant code including handling of initialization and validation. No additional code elements outside the provided seem to be directly relevant. Therefore, the identified spans are sufficiently relevant to the issue.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
