The search should focus on identifying where this hint message is defined or referenced, particularly in relation to ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes or methods. The main files to inspect are likely within django/db/models/fields and related modules, such as related.py, base.py, and reverse_related.py, because these contain classes and methods directly dealing with these field types and their relationships.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
