            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the incorrect hint Django provides when dealing with recursive relationships in ManyToMany fields using intermediary models. Specifically, it points out that the hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical' and 'through', which are incorrect as they should apply to ManyToManyField. Additionally, it mentions that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for versions above 3.0.\n\nThe search results provide detailed code spans from Django's `related.py` module, which is relevant to the issue at hand. The file `django/db/models/fields/related.py` contains definitions for various related fields and their behaviors, including a `ManyToManyField` class which is particularly relevant. The `ManyToManyField` class contains methods and attributes that manage the setup and configuration of many-to-many relationships, including those with intermediary models and recursive relationships.\n\nGiven the detailed nature of the search results and the direct relevance to the reported issue, they provide a comprehensive view of how Django currently handles ManyToMany relationships, including the management of recursive relationships and intermediary models. The specific code spans related to `ManyToManyField` are crucial as they contain the logic used for initializing these fields, checking their configurations, and managing their database interactions.\n\nBy analyzing the `ManyToManyField` class and its methods, it becomes clear that this section of code directly addresses the issues mentioned in the reported problem concerning the incorrect hint and outdated requirements for recursive relationships. This indicates that a modification to the `ManyToManyField` class, especially in its initialization and related checks, would be appropriate to resolve the reported issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the search results are highly relevant to the reported issue, and the identified code spans provide a clear path towards understanding and potentially rectifying the issue within the Django framework.",
