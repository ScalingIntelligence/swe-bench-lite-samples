This issue likely lies within the Django framework's model field definitions or the related documentation. To address this, we need to search within Django's model field definitions (particularly ForeignKey and ManyToManyField) for any mentions or usage hints related to recursive relationships. Additionally, we should look for incorrect documentation or hints in these fields.",

The search results are relevant as they include definitions and initializations of both ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes, as well as checks and error messages for many-to-many relationships, particularly focusing on recursive relationships and the use of intermediary models. The focus should be on the ManyToManyField class and its methods, especially where it handles errors related to through_fields and recursive relationships. The relevant spans seem to be those dealing with the creation and configuration of ManyToManyFields, error handling, and recursive relationship nuances.",
