The search results provided are relevant to this issue as they include code spans from 'ManyToManyField', which is the relevant class here. The 'ManyToManyField' class and its '__init__', 'check', and '_check_relationship_model' methods are particularly relevant as they handle the initialization, validation, and hint generation for ManyToMany relationships, including recursive ones. The spans 'ManyToManyField.__init__', 'ManyToManyField.check', and 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model' are identified as they directly relate to the code handling ManyToMany relationships and hint generation, which aligns with the reported issue.
