The hint provided by Django is suggesting the use of ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are actually meant for ManyToManyField and not ForeignKey and 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for such relationships since Django 3.0. The search results contain several key sections that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. 'ForeignKey.get_reverse_path_info' and 'ForeignKey.resolve_related_fields': These sections handle the resolution of related fields and paths for ForeignKey, which is directly related to the miscommunication in the hint.\n\n2. 'create_many_to_many_intermediary_model': This function is responsible for creating intermediary models for ManyToManyField, and understanding how it manages recursive relationships is crucial.\n\n3. 'ManyToManyField.__init__' and 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class': These sections define the ManyToManyField class and how it contributes to the class definition. Specifically, the '__init__' method handles the initialization of ManyToManyField with various parameters including 'symmetrical' and 'through', and the 'contribute_to_class' method handles the contribution to the class where the field is defined.\n\nGiven the comprehensive nature of these sections, they should provide enough context and code to address the reported issue. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
