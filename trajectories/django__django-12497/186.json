            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves a misleading hint in Django's error message when dealing with recursive relationships involving more than two ForeignKeys in an intermediary model for a ManyToManyField without specifying through_fields. The hint incorrectly suggests using `ForeignKey` with `symmetrical=False` and `through=`, which are ManyToManyField arguments. Additionally, `symmetrical=False` is outdated and not required since Django 3.0. To address this, we need to locate the part of the Django codebase responsible for generating this hint and correct it. Considering the hints and the context provided, we should focus on the `ManyToManyField` and `ForeignKey` classes and their relationship handling functions.",

The error message incorrectly suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' args for ForeignKey, instead of ManyToManyField. I first examined the FileBasedWithSpans, which initially indicates no relevant code identified. Moving to the search results, I noted the modules 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py', focusing on spans relevant to ManyToManyField, ForeignKey, and the relationship model check. \n\nWithin 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', the 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model' span specifically addresses situations where more than two foreign keys are seen in a recursive relationship model without through_fields specified. This section seemed crucial, particularly because it might contain the erroneous hint. I checked 'ForeignKey' spans for overlapping issues that ForeignKey might mistakenly be handling as ManyToManyField settings, but this was not directly relevant to the hint issue. At the start, the hint's relevance mentioned by the user seemed correctly placed where the through_fields are being checked and where they aren't specified, leading me to assume any corrections would take place around that location.",
