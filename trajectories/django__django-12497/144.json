            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves a misleading hint in Django regarding recursive relationships involving multiple ForeignKeys in an intermediary model without specified through_fields. The hint incorrectly mentions 'symmetrical' and 'through' as ForeignKey arguments, but these are ManyToManyField arguments. It also mentions that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships with an intermediary model. To address this, we need to find the code responsible for generating this hint. Given the nature of the issue, the relevant code is likely in the Django ORM or model field definitions, specifically in the sections handling ManyToManyField and ForeignKey relationships, including the hint generation logic. Focus should be on the `ManyToManyField` and `ForeignKey` classes in `django/db/models/fields/`.",

This is incorrect because 'symmetrical' and 'through' are specific to ManyToManyField and not ForeignKey. The issue also mentions that 'symmetrical=False' is outdated for recursive relationships since Django 3.0.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, there are several relevant code spans that are identified as potentially related to the reported issue. These spans include definitions and initializations of 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField', as well as their respective methods involving 'related_name', 'related_query_name', and other parameters crucial to the relationship setup between models.\n\nIn particular, the 'ForeignKey.__init__' span details the initialization parameters for ForeignKey which include 'related_name', 'related_query_name', among others, none of which mention 'symmetrical' or 'through'. This directly contradicts the incorrect hint mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the 'ManyToManyField.__init__' span shows the correct usage of 'symmetrical' and 'through' parameters, reinforcing the need for these arguments in the correct field type, ManyToManyField, and not ForeignKey as incorrectly hinted.\n\nFurthermore, the 'create_many_to_many_intermediary_model' function also provides context for how intermediary models are handled in many-to-many relationships, which could be relevant if the error in the hint has implications on how developers set up these intermediary models.\n\nGiven these findings, it is concluded that the search results contain relevant code spans that could help in understanding and addressing the incorrect hint issue reported.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
