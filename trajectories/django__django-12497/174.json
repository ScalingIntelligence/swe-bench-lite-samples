Specifically, the hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. This mistake suggests the developer might have intended to use ManyToManyField but mistakenly used ForeignKey. We need to focus our search on the ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes within Django's model fields to find where this hint is being generated or checked.",

Specifically, the hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are incorrect as these are ManyToManyField arguments, not ForeignKey arguments.\n\nAnalyzing the search results in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', it's clear that both 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField' classes are present, which is relevant to the issue. The '_check_relationship_model' method within 'ManyToManyField' appears to be the exact location where the hint in question is provided. This method checks the relationship model and provides the hint in case of ambiguity with multiple foreign keys.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the relevant code spans are those related to the 'ManyToManyField' class, particularly the '_check_relationship_model' method where the hint is specified. This method needs to be corrected to reflect the proper way to handle recursive relationships in Django, which does not involve 'ForeignKey'.\n\nThus, the identified relevant code spans are:\n- 'ManyToManyField'\n- 'ManyToManyField.__init__'\n- 'ManyToManyField.check'\n- 'ManyToManyField._check_unique'\n- 'ManyToManyField._check_ignored_options'\n- 'ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model'",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
