Specifically, the hint incorrectly suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are actually applicable to 'ManyToManyField' and have been outdated for recursive relationships since Django 3.0.\n\nThe provided search results involve two primary classes relevant to this issue: 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField'. The 'ForeignKey' class contains methods and properties that handle various aspects of ForeignKey relationships, such as resolving related fields, database type parameters, and handling recursive relationships. The 'ManyToManyField' class, on the other hand, handles many-to-many relationships, including the definition of recursive relationships and the handling of intermediary models. The '_check_relationship_model' method within 'ManyToManyField' is particularly relevant as it checks the correct usage of ForeignKeys in intermediary models and provides an error message that matches the misleading hint described in the issue.\n\nGiven the context, the most relevant code spans are those within the 'ManyToManyField' class, specifically the '__init__' method where the 'symmetrical' and 'through' parameters are defined and the '_check_relationship_model' method where the erroneous hint is generated. These spans are crucial for understanding how Django currently handles recursive relationships and intermediary models, and how the error message is constructed.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
