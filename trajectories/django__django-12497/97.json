The hint incorrectly mentions 'symmetrical' and 'through' as ForeignKey parameters instead of ManyToManyField, and it incorrectly states that 'symmetrical=False' is required for recursive relationships with intermediary models, which is outdated since Django 3.0. To address this, we should focus our search on the ManyToManyField class and related functions where this hint might be generated.",

Specifically, the hint suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' keyword arguments with ForeignKey, which are actually meant for ManyToManyField. The analysis of the search results reveals relevant sections in the codebase, particularly in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py'. Key spans include the definition of ManyToManyField, its initialization, and handling of 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments. These spans are directly related to the issue as they involve the specific functionality intended to be corrected. Furthermore, the code demonstrates how recursive relationships are handled in Django models, which is crucial for understanding the context of the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant and should contribute to the resolution of the issue.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
