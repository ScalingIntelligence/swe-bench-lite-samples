To address this, I will identify relevant code spans across several files in the Django source code that deal with ManyToManyField and ForeignKey, especially where hints or error messages are generated or where the initialization and validation of these fields are handled.\n\n1. **django/db/models/fields/related.py**: This file includes definitions for ManyToManyField and ForeignKey classes, as well as methods like __init__ and resolve_related_fields. Especially relevant is the ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model method, which checks for recursive relationships and through_fields, and potentially generates the erroneous hint.\n2. **django/db/models/base.py**: This file contains the Model class with class methods that check for validity, including checks on many-to-many relationships through intermediary models.\n3. **django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py**: This file defines reverse relationships like ManyToManyRel, which is related to how ManyToManyField is managed in relation to its target model.\n\nWhile reviewing these parts of the code, I will look for sections that handle the generation of hints or errors regarding recursive relationships and through_fields.

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
