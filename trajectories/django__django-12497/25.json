The hint incorrectly mentions using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are actually ManyToManyField arguments. This mistake suggests a potential confusion between ForeignKey and ManyToManyField when dealing with recursive relationships.\n\nReviewing the provided code spans in 'related.py', several relevant sections are identified:\n\n1. The 'ForeignKey' class definition, showing that ForeignKey extends ForeignObject and is specifically for many-to-one relationships, not many-to-many.\n2. The 'ManyToManyField' class definition, indicating it is used for many-to-many relationships and includes arguments like 'symmetrical' and 'through'.\n3. The '__init__' method of ManyToManyField, which handles the initialization of these arguments, including 'symmetrical' and 'through'.\n4. The '_check_relationship_model' method within ManyToManyField, which checks for potential issues with the relationship model, such as multiple ForeignKeys and the need for 'through_fields'. This method also contains the problematic hint suggesting the use of ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through'.\n\nThese code spans are directly relevant to the issue, as they involve the definitions and behavior of both ForeignKey and ManyToManyField, particularly in the context of recursive relationships and intermediary models. This analysis confirms the identified code spans are relevant for addressing the reported issue.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
