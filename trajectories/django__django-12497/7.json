The hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical' and 'through' arguments, which are incorrect for ManyToManyField. The search should focus on the code that generates this hint, likely within the ManyToManyField class or related validation methods. Target files include related.py and base.py, which contain the ManyToManyField and Model classes respectively, involved in handling these relationships. The specific search term should be reflective of the incorrect hint to pinpoint exact areas in the code.",

The hint suggests using 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are incorrect for ManyToManyField. The developer mistakenly typed ForeignKey instead of ManyToManyField. The task is to identify the relevant code spans concerning ManyToManyField and ForeignKey, specifically focusing on initialization, resolution of related fields, and handling recursive relationships. After analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the relevant sections include the definition and initialization of ManyToManyField, the ForeignKey class, and its method to resolve related fields. These sections are crucial for understanding and potentially correcting the hint about recursive relationships. The search results also include checks and resolution methods for related fields, which are indirectly relevant to the issue. Therefore, the identified code spans should cover the initialization and behavior of ManyToManyField and ForeignKey when handling recursive relationships.",
