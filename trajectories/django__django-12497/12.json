The hint incorrectly mentions 'symmetrical' and 'through' keyword arguments, which are specific to ManyToManyField and not ForeignKey. Also, 'symmetrical=False' is mentioned but is not required since Django 3.0. To address this, we need to search for the code related to the hint message generation for ManyToManyField and ForeignKey fields, focusing on the error hint strings and the conditions under which these hints are generated.",

The hint provided incorrectly uses ForeignKey arguments instead of ManyToManyField arguments, particularly 'symmetrical' and 'through'.\n\nTo address this, we need to look for code related to ManyToManyField and ForeignKey in Django's model fields. From the provided search results, there are several relevant code spans:\n\n1. The 'ManyToManyField' class definition and its methods.\n2. The 'ForeignKey' class definition and its methods.\n3. The 'resolve_related_fields' method in both 'ForeignObject' and 'ForeignKey'.\n\nThe 'ManyToManyField.__init__' span is particularly relevant as it initializes many-to-many relationships and deals with arguments like 'symmetrical' and 'through'. Additionally, the 'ForeignKey' and 'ForeignObject' classes and their methods are relevant as they provide context on how foreign key relationships are handled, which could be mistakenly referenced in the hint.\n\nIt's important to also check the 'resolve_related_fields' method in both 'ForeignObject' and 'ForeignKey' to understand how related fields are resolved, as this might be where the incorrect hint logic would need to be corrected.\n\nOverall, these spans should provide enough context to address the issue, particularly focusing on the initialization of ManyToManyFields and the resolution of related fields in both ManyToManyField and ForeignKey.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
