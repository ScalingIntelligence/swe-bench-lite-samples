The description points to outdated requirements for setting up recursive relationships with intermediate models, emphasizing that these should be corrected in the source code. Given the nature of the issue, it is likely related to the ManyToManyField class and its documentation or checks where the misunderstandings occur. The provided files largely involve Django's model handling, fields, and schema management, indicating where the impact of the incorrect hint could be, specifically in relation to the handling of many-to-many relationships.",

The issue also mentions that 'symmetrical=False' is not required since Django 3.0. The search results include code spans from Django's models and fields modules, which are relevant to ManyToManyField and its handling of recursive relationships. The code spans 'ManyToManyField.__init__', 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class', and 'ManyToManyField.contribute_to_related_class' are particularly relevant as they deal with the initialization and contribution of a ManyToManyField to a class, which includes handling symmetrical and through arguments. These spans point to the source of the issue regarding the incorrect hint, which involves the ManyToManyField class and its handling of recursive relationships.

The file context provided includes the code for RelatedField, ForeignObject, ForeignKey, and ManyToManyField classes in the django/db/models/fields/related.py file. The ManyToManyField class is particularly relevant, as it includes parameters like 'symmetrical' and 'through' which the issue mentions as being incorrectly used with ForeignKey. The code also includes the definition for create_many_to_many_intermediary_model, which is likely where the hint for recursive relationships would be implemented or corrected. Therefore, the provided file context is complete for addressing the issue as it contains the primary classes and functions relevant to many-to-many relationships and recursive relationships specifically.
