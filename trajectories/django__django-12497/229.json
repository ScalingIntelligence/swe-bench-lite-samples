The hint provided is mistakenly suggesting to use 'ForeignKey' with 'symmetrical=False' and 'through', which are actually ManyToManyField keyword arguments. This could stem from a mix-up where the developer intended to convey ManyToManyField but mentioned ForeignKey. It is necessary to search for the usage and definition of ManyToManyField, ForeignKey, and their related methods, especially focusing on where recursive relationships and intermediary models are handled.",

The key points are: the hint suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical=False, through=...', which is erroneous as 'symmetrical' and 'through' are attributes of ManyToManyField, not ForeignKey. Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' requirement is outdated since Django 3.0. The search results contain relevant sections from Django's model field definitions and related classes. Notably, the ManyToManyField class defines the behavior of many-to-many relationships, including handling of 'symmetrical' and 'through' parameters. The hints about recursive relationships are likely generated in code related to resolving these fields. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that the 'ManyToManyField.__init__' span is particularly relevant as it deals directly with the initialization of many-to-many relationships, including handling of 'symmetrical' and 'through' parameters, which are central to the issue. Therefore, the 'ManyToManyField.__init__' span should be identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n"
