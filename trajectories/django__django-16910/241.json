The problem is that not all fields from the related model should be included in the generated SQL. Given the provided context, it's clear that the issue may lie within the methods handling these operations. We should focus our search on the `Query` and `QuerySet` classes, as well as the specific methods related to field selection and SQL generation. Additionally, methods in `compiler.py` that handle SQL generation for related models might be relevant. Therefore, specifying the `only` and `select_related` methods in the search parameters should help narrow down the relevant code snippets and resolve the issue.",
