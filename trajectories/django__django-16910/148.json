The focus should be on the inheritance and method implementations in the `QuerySet` class and its related SQL compilation and query building logic. Also, attention should be given to the `OneToOneField` class and its descriptor classes as they handle the reverse lookup behavior. The provided context suggests that changes in these areas might have affected the SQL query generation, leading to the inclusion of all fields from the related model instead of the specified fields in Django 4.2. Therefore, looking into methods such as `only()`, `select_related()`, and SQL compilation methods like `get_select_mask()`, `get_related_selections()`, and `as_sql()` would be crucial. Additionally, examining the logic in classes that manage relationships and descriptors, like `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` and `ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`, could provide insights into what adjustments are needed to restore the correct SQL query generation from earlier Django versions.",

The issue specifically points out that when using `only()` with `select_related()` on a reverse OneToOneField, the SQL generated still includes all fields from the related model, which is not the expected behavior. Given this, the relevant code spans should focus on these methods within the QuerySet class and their interactions with the OneToOneField.\n\nReviewing the search results, the file `django/db/models/query.py` contains the implementations of `QuerySet.only()`, `QuerySet.select_related()`, and other related methods. These method definitions are directly relevant to the issue as they involve the core logic for filtering and selecting related fields. Additionally, `django/db/models/fields/related.py` includes the `OneToOneField` class and its methods, which are crucial for understanding how this specific field type interacts with the QuerySet methods.\n\nFurthermore, the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file contains an overview of SQL compilation and generation, which is essential for determining how the SQL queries are constructed and why the incorrect query is being generated for this specific use case. Specifically, `SQLCompiler.get_select()` and `SQLCompiler.get_default_columns()` methods are relevant for filtering and selecting columns in the SQL query generation process.",
