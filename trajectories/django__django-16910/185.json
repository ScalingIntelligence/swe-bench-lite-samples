The problem is that the `only()` method does not restrict the fields of the related model as expected, leading to all fields being included in the generated SQL query. This behavior changed between Django 4.1.9 and 4.2.1. To investigate this, we need to focus on the methods and logic that handle the `only()` and `select_related()` methods, as well as the resolution of fields in queries involving related models. The relevant files identified in the context include `django/db/models/query.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. We will specifically look for methods that handle field selection and joins in queries, such as `get_select_mask`, `get_related_selections`, `setup_joins`, and `get_select`.",

The problem is that the `only()` method does not correctly limit the fields when used with `select_related()`, leading to more fields being included in the SQL query than expected. This issue is specific to Django 4.2, as the behavior was correct in Django 4.1.9.\n\nThree key files are identified as relevant: `django/db/models/query.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. These files contain the implementation of the `QuerySet` class and its methods (`select_related`, `only`), as well as the `Query` class responsible for SQL query generation, and the `SQLCompiler` class responsible for compiling these queries into SQL statements.\n\nSpecifically, the `QuerySet.select_related` and `QuerySet.only` methods in `query.py` are where the `select_related` and `only` functionality are directly implemented. The `Query.get_select_mask` method in `query.py` and `SQLCompiler.get_select` and `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` methods in `compiler.py` are also relevant as they deal with how the fields are selected and compiled into SQL queries. These methods need to ensure that when `only()` is used with `select_related()`, only the specified fields are included in the generated SQL query, especially for reverse OneToOneField relations.\n\nThe analysis of the code spans reveals that the current implementation does not correctly handle the combination of `only()` and `select_related()` for reverse OneToOneField relations, leading to the inclusion of all fields from the related model. This indicates a need to adjust the code to correctly implement the desired behavior.",

The issue describes how using `only()` in conjunction with `select_related()` on such relations results in an incorrect SQL query in Django 4.2, whereas it worked correctly in Django 4.1. The provided sample models and code snippets illustrate the problem by showing how the generated SQL query includes all fields from the related model, not just the specified fields. \n\nFrom the given context, the identified code spans particularly focus on the `QuerySet` class methods (`select_related()` and `only()`), and the `Query` class methods related to query generation and field selection. These spans seem relevant to the issue because they directly manage how fields are selected and related models are joined in the query. \n\nTo address the issue in future development efforts, it would be essential to analyze and possibly modify the methods `select_related()` and `only()` in `QuerySet` or their backend functionalities in `Query` and `SQLCompiler` to ensure that the constraints defined by `only()` are correctly applied in the SQL query when `select_related()` is used for reverse OneToOneField relations.\n\nGiven the identified code spans and the task context, the following spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue: `Query`, `Query.__init__`, `Query.get_select_mask`, `Query.setup_joins`, `QuerySet.select_related`, and `QuerySet.only`.",
