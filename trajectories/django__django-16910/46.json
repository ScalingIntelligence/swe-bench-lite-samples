The problem is that the `only()` method does not properly restrict the fields when used with `select_related()` on a reverse OneToOneField relation. To address this, we need to investigate the methods in the QuerySet class, particularly `select_related()` and `only()`, and the SQL query generation process. The relevant files identified so far include `django/db/models/query.py` (where QuerySet methods are defined), `django/db/models/sql/query.py` (for SQL query generation), and `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` (to understand the behavior of related descriptors). We should focus on these files for further investigation.",

These methods are responsible for handling the select_related and only functionalities, which are central to the issue. By looking at these methods, I can identify how they interact and potentially where the defect occurs. There's a need to ensure that the fields specified in only() are correctly respected when combined with select_related(), and that unnecessary fields from the related model are not included in the SQL query. The examination of the query.py file's Query class and its methods will help in understanding the SQL generation process and how deferred fields are managed.",

The issue mentions that when using `select_related()` together with `only()`, all fields from the related model are included in the generated SQL, which contrasts with the expected behavior from previous versions of Django. To address this, we need to inspect the methods `QuerySet.select_related()`, `QuerySet.only()`, and `Query.add_select_related()` to understand how they interact and potentially identify the root cause of the issue. The search results show the method `Query.add_immediate_loading()`, which is not directly mentioned in the file context but might be relevant as it involves immediate loading of fields, which might affect the behavior described in the issue. Thus, we will include this method in our analysis to consider its potential impact on the observed behavior.",
