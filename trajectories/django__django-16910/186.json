The focus is on the generated SQL query, where all fields from the related model are included when using `only()` with `select_related()`. This behavior changed from Django 4.1.9 to 4.2.1, highlighting a potential regression or change in the handling of these methods.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, we find multiple relevant sections: Phrases like '_chain()', 'add_immediate_loading(fields)', and 'add_select_related(fields)' in django/db/models/query.py indicate how these methods manipulate and propagate related selections and field loading settings.\n\nIn django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, the method 'get_related_selections()' is particularly relevant. It details how related selections are managed within the query compilation. This understanding helps in determining if the logic for handling related selects is broadly inclusive in ways that impact the OneToOne relationship query.\n\nAdditionally, in django/db/models/sql/query.py, 'get_select_mask()', and 'add_select_related()' offer insights into how the query object itself is constructed to accommodate related fields. These functions discuss how input fields are parsed and integrated into the query context as regards deferred or immediate loading, and related data selections.\n\nOverall, these code spans are highly relevant as they focus on specific behavior alteration between Django versions and contain direct links to handling select related and deferred loading logic. Hence, identifying these sections is crucial for addressing the reported issue and assessing any underlying bugs or omissions in how the query interactions are handled.",

This involves changing the part of the method that handles the inclusion of related fields, specifically around the handling of reverse relations.
