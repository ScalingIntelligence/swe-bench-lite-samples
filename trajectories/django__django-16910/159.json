The problem is that the generated SQL query includes all fields from the related model instead of only the specified fields. This issue may be due to changes in how Django handles field selection and SQL query generation in version 4.2 compared to earlier versions. To address this, we should focus on the `QuerySet`, `SQLCompiler`, and `Query` classes in the `django/db/models/` subdirectory. Specifically, we should look for methods related to field selection and SQL query generation.",

The issue is that all fields from the related model are still included in the generated SQL, whereas in Django 4.1.9, only the specified fields are included. This problem is likely to be related to the underlying logic in the Query class that handles the generation of the SQL query based on the selected and deferred fields. Multiple methods in the Query class manage this process, including _get_defer_select_mask and _get_only_select_mask, which are responsible for generating the mask that determines which fields to include in the query. The provided search results include these methods and their logic, which is relevant to the issue at hand. The methods appear to recursively process the field masks to determine which fields to include or defer, including handling relations across models. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

The problem is that all fields from the related model are included in the generated SQL query, which is not the expected behavior when using `only()`. To address this, we need to examine the code related to how `only()` and `select_related()` are implemented and how they interact with reverse OneToOneField relations. From the provided context, relevant code spans are found in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/query.py` files, specifically focusing on the `get_select_mask`, `_get_defer_select_mask`, `_get_only_select_mask`, and `only` methods. These methods handle the deferred loading and selection of fields, which are critical for understanding how to resolve the issue. We should also consider the `select_related` method to ensure it integrates correctly with the field selection mechanisms.",
