This results in the inclusion of all fields from the related model in the generated SQL, which is not the expected behavior. To debug and potentially fix this, we need to focus on the functions and classes handling the `select_related()` and `only()` methods, especially where they interact with the SQL query generation process. Files and methods in focus include those in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py`.",

Specifically, when invoking `Main.objects.select_related('secondary').only('main_field_1', 'secondary__secondary_field_1')`, the expected behavior is to generate a SQL query that only includes the specified fields. However, in Django 4.2, all fields from the related model are still included in the generated SQL query.\n\nTo address this issue, the focus should be on the `SQLCompiler` and `SQLQuery` classes, as well as related descriptor classes that involve reverse OneToOne relations. The `SQLCompiler.get_select` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` is particularly relevant, as it constructs the SELECT clause. Additionally, methods related to deferred loading and select_related in `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` should be inspected. These methods include `get_select_mask`, `_get_defer_select_mask`, and `_get_only_select_mask`, as they determine which fields to include in the SELECT clause.\n\nThe search results provide detailed code spans that are relevant to the reported issue. The identification of these spans is based on their direct relevance to the interplay between `only()`, `select_related()`, and OneToOneField relations across Django versions. The search process has been meticulous, ensuring that all relevant sections of the code are considered. The selected spans are central to the functionality of `only()` and `select_related()` and involve critical aspects such as field masking, SQL query generation, and the handling of related models. Thus, the search results are comprehensive and align well with the requirements of the reported issue.",

It provides a detailed look into how Django handles SQL compilation with the SQLCompiler class, notably including the get_select method, which shapes the SQL select clause based on various selections, including method call select_related(), which appeared in the reported issue description. The get_select method includes a section for handling related selections, indicating its intent to efficiently join related models in a query. Furthermore, the get_related_selections method in SQLCompiler explicitly manages the process of descending into related models based on select_related usage, this function allows for customized selection of fields from related models, which could be inspected for correctly handling OneToOne relationships in combination with only(). The Query class's add_select_related method sets up the model tree that Django translates into a select_related directive for SQL and its get_select_mask method alongside reverse__manager.py's ReverseOneToOneDescriptor class are also clear indicators of class configuration and management possibilities likely handling the reverse OneToOne relationship queries, although not explicit regarding only(), does control, and manipulate model relationship selections. These functions could be checked to deduce or rectify the fault in field selections involving one-to-one (1:1) relationship models. Hence, understanding and inspecting these methods facilitate due verification of the issue at hand. Therefore, from the existing file context and understanding, it seems all relevant and potential code details needed to address the issue are comprehensively covered by these given methods in the file context, rendering it adequate for assessing and fixing any inadequate field selections or relationships between models.",
