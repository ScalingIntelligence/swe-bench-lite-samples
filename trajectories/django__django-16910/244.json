Specifically, the `only()` method does not apply correctly when used with `select_related()` on a reverse OneToOneField relation, leading to all fields of the related model being included in the SQL query. To address this, we should look into the methods responsible for handling these query set operations, particularly in files dealing with SQL compilation, query handling, and specifically the OneToOneField relation. The initial search should focus on the specified files noted as relevant and also consider methods and classes related to handling `select_related` and `only` methods within these files.",

This discrepancy needs to be addressed.\n\nFrom the provided search results, several code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing this issue:\n\n1. **django/db/models/query.py - QuerySet.only**\n   This method is directly related to the `only()` function call in the reported issue. It handles the specification of which fields to include in the query.\n\n2. **django/db/models/sql/query.py - Query.get_select_mask**\n   This method is responsible for determining which fields should be selected based on the deferred loading strategy (either `only()` or `defer()`).\n\n3. **django/db/models/sql/compiler.py - SQLCompiler.get_select**\n   This method constructs the SELECT clause of the SQL query, including the determination of which fields to include.\n\n4. **django/db/models/fields/related.py - OneToOneField**\n   This class definition is relevant as it pertains to the OneToOneField behavior, which is central to the reported issue.\n\nBy examining these spans, we can gain deeper insights into how the `only()` method interacts with `select_related()` and the generation of SQL queries, particularly with respect to OneToOneField relations.

Finally, the `OneToOneField` class is contained within the `related.py` file, ensuring a full context of the field's handling in Django's ORM.
