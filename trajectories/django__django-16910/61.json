The provided code spans from `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/query.py` are relevant as they involve the classes and methods essential for understanding how `select_related()` and `only()` are implemented and how they interact with each other. The `SQLCompiler` class in `compiler.py` is particularly relevant for examining how SQL queries are compiled, especially the `get_select` and `get_related_selections` methods which are central to how fields from related models are included in the SQL query. Meanwhile, within `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet` class handles operations on sets of model instances, with `select_related` and `only` methods defining how related objects and fields are selected and included in queries. These methods are crucial for tackling the issue, as the problem described might stem from how these methods are implemented or how they interact with each other when processing reverse OneToOneField relations. By focusing on these parts of the code, we can identify potential issues or improvements needed to resolve the described problem.",
