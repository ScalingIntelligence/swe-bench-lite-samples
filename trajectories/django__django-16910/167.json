The provided code snippet defines the Query class in Django's ORM, which is responsible for constructing SQL queries based on the operations like select_related and only. The specific method get_select_mask seems to be handling how the fields to be selected are determined, which is directly related to the issue of fields not being excluded as expected when using only with select_related on reverse OneToOneField relations. This method differentiates between deferred fields (handled by _get_defer_select_mask) and fields to be exclusively selected (handled by _get_only_select_mask). Since the issue reporter suggests that all fields from the related model are still included in the generated SQL, it implies a potential problem in how the select mask is calculated, particularly in the _get_only_select_mask method.
