Specifically, it was noted that in Django 4.2, the `only()` method does not correctly limit the fields included in the SQL query when combined with `select_related()`. This is not the case in Django 4.1.9. The provided search results include code spans related to the `QuerySet` class and the `Query` class, which are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving this issue. The `QuerySet.only()` and `QuerySet.select_related()` methods are of particular interest, as they directly relate to the reported issue. Similarly, the `Query.add_select_related()` and `Query.get_select_mask()` methods are relevant because they handle the internal logic of how fields are selected and related models are handled. These code spans are essential for diagnosing why the current behavior might be occurring in Django 4.2 compared to previous versions. They will provide insights into the mechanisms behind field selection and relation joining in the generated SQL queries.",
