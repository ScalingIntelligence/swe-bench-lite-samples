The issue suggests that the SQL query generated by Django 4.2 includes all fields from the related model, which is not the intended behavior. The relevant code spans need to be identified that handle the `only()` and `select_related()` methods, as well as the logic that constructs the SQL query. Below, I analyze the provided search results to identify the relevant code spans that might be causing the issue. The identified spans include methods from the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` that deal with deferred loading and field selection, as well as methods from the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` that implement `select_related()` and `only()`. These methods are likely candidates for further investigation or potential modification to resolve the issue. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` is involved in translating the query into SQL, which may also hold clues to the issue.",
