This problem seems to affect the SQL query generation, specifically how fields from the related model are included in the query. Given the context, it's crucial to focus on the `QuerySet`, `Query`, and `SQLCompiler` classes, as these are directly involved in query construction and execution. Additionally, the `OneToOneField` and related descriptors might also play a role in how relations are handled. Therefore, the search should concentrate on these classes and their methods to uncover where the bug might lie.",

Specifically, it highlights that using `only()` with `select_related()` on such relations does not generate the correct query, leading to all fields from the related model being included in the generated SQL, even when only specific fields are specified.\n\nThe examination of the provided code spans in `django/db/models/query.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` reveals relevant methods and functions that could be related to the issue at hand. These include:\n\n1. `QuerySet.only()` - This method is responsible for selecting specific fields from the model. The issue might be related to how this method interacts with the select_related functionality.\n2. `QuerySet.select_related()` - This method is used to follow foreign key relationships and reduce the number of queries needed. The issue might be related to how this method processes reverse OneToOneField relations.\n3. `Query._get_only_select_mask()` and `Query._get_defer_select_mask()` - These methods are related to how fields are masked or deferred in the query construction, which could be relevant to understanding how fields from related models are included.\n4. `SQLCompiler.get_default_columns()` and `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections()` - These methods are involved in generating the SQL query and might influence how related fields are included or excluded.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans touch on key areas where the issue could potentially be rooted. Further investigation into the interaction between these methods and how they handle reverse OneToOneField relations would be necessary to fully diagnose and resolve the issue.",
