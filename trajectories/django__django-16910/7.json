This issue seems to be specifically related to the SQL query generation process in Django 4.2, as the generated SQL includes all fields from the related model whereas in Django 4.1.9 it includes only the specified fields. To pinpoint the cause, we should focus on the methods responsible for constructing the SQL queries and managing the field selections in the `Query` and `SQLCompiler` classes, especially those related to `select_related` and `only` methods.",
