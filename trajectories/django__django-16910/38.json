This problem is particularly evident in Django 4.2, where the generated SQL query still includes all fields from the related model. The specific methods of interest are those dealing with query construction, field masking (defer and only), and related object handling. Targeting methods in the `SQLCompiler`, `Query`, and `QuerySet` classes should help uncover the logic errors that lead to this behavior.",

The issue describes that when using these methods together, the SQL query generated in Django 4.2 includes all fields from the related model instead of only the specified ones, which is a deviation from the behavior observed in Django 4.1.9. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py` files. These spans include methods such as `get_related_selections()`, `add_fields()`, `add_select_related()`, and `only()`, which are directly involved in the functionality of constructing and optimizing SQL queries based on the specified fields and relations. By carefully examining these code spans, it is evident that they handle the logic of field selection, relation traversal, and generation of SQL join clauses, all of which are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the reported issue.",
