The problem is that all fields from the related model are included in the generated SQL, even when specific fields are requested. To address this, we need to examine the methods in Django's ORM that handle these operations: `select_related()` and `only()`. Focusing on `QuerySet`, `Query`, and `SQLCompiler` classes is crucial, as they handle query construction and execution. Specifically, we should look into how `get_select_mask()`, `add_select_related()`, and `as_sql()` methods in `Query` class process these requests. Additionally, `get_related_selections()` in `SQLCompiler` might be relevant for understanding how related fields are included in the select clause.",
