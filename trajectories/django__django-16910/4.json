Specifically, the methods to investigate are `QuerySet.select_related()` and `QuerySet.only()`, and their underlying logic in handling field selections and related object loading. Additionally, the SQL generation and field masking logic in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` files should be checked to ensure the correct SQL is being generated for these scenarios.",

The problem is that calling `only()` with `select_related()` does not generate the correct SQL query, resulting in all fields from the related model being included. This issue seems to be specific to Django 4.2. I analyzed the provided code spans and identified relevant portions in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. In `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet` class methods `select_related()` and `only()` seem to handle the respective functionalities but do not account for the specific interaction issue when used together on a reverse OneToOneField. This is evidenced by the lack of specific checks or handling for such a combination within these methods. In `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, the `SQLCompiler` class and its method `get_related_selections()` are responsible for generating the SQL query based on the select related operations. The method `get_related_selections()` does not seem to filter out unnecessary fields when combining `select_related()` with `only()`, which aligns with the described issue. No relevant code spans were found in `django/db/backends/mysql/compiler.py` as the issue is not specific to the MySQL backend but a general Django ORM issue.",
