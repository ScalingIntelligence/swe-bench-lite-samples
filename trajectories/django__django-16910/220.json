The problem is that the 'only()' method does not restrict the fields from the related model as expected, leading to all fields being included in the generated SQL query. This discrepancy appears in Django 4.2.1 compared to previous versions such as 4.1.9. It's likely that the problem lies within the implementation of these methods and their interactions, particularly in how the select mask is determined and applied. Given the provided context, focusing on the 'get_select_mask', 'get_related_selections', and 'add_select_related' methods in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and 'django/db/models/query.py' would be a good starting point.",

This discrepancy affects Django 4.2 as opposed to earlier versions like 4.1.9. The search results provided from the Django source code ('django/db/models/query.py') include the relevant methods 'select_related()' and 'only()'. These methods are critical to addressing the reported issue. The 'select_related()' method sets up the query to use SQL joins to avoid additional queries to the database for related objects, while the 'only()' method is used to specify which fields should be loaded.

The key problem is that the generated SQL query includes all fields from the related model when only specific fields are requested. The provided search results include relevant code spans from the `query.py` file that handle the `only()` and `select_related()` methods, as well as the internal state and logic of the Query class. Specifically, the code spans `Query`, `Query.__init__`, `Query._get_defer_select_mask`, `Query._get_only_select_mask`, `Query.get_select_mask`, `Query.add_select_related`, and `Query.add_immediate_loading` are highly relevant as they directly deal with managing the fields to be included in the query and the related models to be joined. These methods are crucial for understanding the current behavior and for identifying where the problem might lie or what changes could be made to fix the issue. The context from `query.py` suggests that the task isn't complete since the search only covers internal query construction and doesn't delve into the query execution or SQL generation phases where the final SQL is actually composed, which is crucial for resolving the issue. Therefore, more investigation into the SQL generation logic within Django's ORM is necessary.",
