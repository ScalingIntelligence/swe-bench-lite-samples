The expected behavior is that calling `only()` with `select_related()` should restrict the fields included in the SQL query to only those specified, but this is not happening correctly in Django 4.2. This inconsistency with previous versions suggests a potential regression or change in behavior in the new version. To address this, we need to focus on the methods and logic that handle the construction of SQL queries for these operations.",

I identified three main areas of interest: \n1. The `QuerySet.select_related` method which is responsible for managing the select related functionality and its interaction with the query. This method sets up the select related configuration for the query.\n2. The `QuerySet.only` method which is responsible for limiting the fields loaded by the query and its interaction with select_related. This method adds the fields specified in the only() call to the query's immediate loading list.\n3. The `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` method which is part of the SQL compilation process. This method takes care of constructing the related selections for the query, which includes managing the fields included in the query based on select related configurations. The method's logic is crucial for ensuring that only the relevant fields from related models are fetched.\n\nKey Points: \nA. The `QuerySet.select_related` and `QuerySet.only` methods are critical because they establish the initial conditions under which a query should be executed, defining which related models should be considered ('select_related') and which fields should be included in the query ('only'). However, they do not directly control the SQL generation.\nB. The `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` method transforms these initial conditions into actual database queries. It iterates over fields and builds selection criteria based on the depth of the relation and which fields are expected to be loaded.\nC. The identified code spans do not directly address the issue of how to reconcile the 'only' fields with the 'select_related' functionality when dealing with reverse OneToOne relationships. The issue seems to specifically arise in how these configurations are translated into SQL, and a deeper look into the SQL generation process considering the nature of OneToOneField reverse lookups might be needed to fully solve the reported issue.\n\nNext Steps: \nFurther analysis or extending the search to spans handling SQL query generation and handling of OneToOneField reverse relations might be necessary to find more accurate or direct code snippets that can resolve the issue.",
