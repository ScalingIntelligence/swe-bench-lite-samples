The problem seems to be related to how Django generates SQL queries when both methods are used together. The SQL query generated in Django 4.2 includes all fields from the related model, which is not the expected behavior. This behavior changed between Django 4.1.9 and 4.2, indicating a potential bug or change in implementation. To diagnose and potentially fix this issue, it's necessary to investigate the methods responsible for handling the `only()` and `select_related()` calls, and how they interact with reverse OneToOne relations. Relevant files include those in the `django/db/models/` directory, particularly `query.py`, `sql/compiler.py`, and `fields/related_descriptors.py`, which contain the core logic for these operations.",

The issue suggests a problem in handling the combination of only() and select_related() methods when dealing with reverse OneToOne relationships. To address this, the analysis must focus on identifying methods and classes that deal with 'only()', 'select_related()', and 'OneToOne' relationships. The specific areas of interest include the QuerySet class for any methods related to only() and select_related(), the SQLCompiler class for how it processes these functions in SQL, and the Query class for its handling of select_related and additional functions like add_select_related and get_select. Additionally, the ReverseOneToOneDescriptor class from the related_descriptors module is also important since it deals directly with reverse OneToOneField relations and how they interact with other model methods. By examining these areas, we can pinpoint the relevant code and determine if the search task is complete by assessing if all functionally critical parts of the codebase related to the issue have been examined.",

The file context also includes crucial sections of the `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which is responsible for generating SQL queries based on the QuerySet operations. Furthermore, the `ReverseOneToOneDescriptor` class from `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` is also provided, which directly deals with reverse OneToOne relationships. These provided sections are sufficient to understand and potentially debug the issue related to the SQL generation for the described scenario.
