The problem seems to be in how the query is being generated, specifically in the handling of the `only()` method when combined with `select_related()`. It is important to focus on the methods related to these functionalities: `select_related()`, `only()`, and the SQL query generation methods within the Django ORM. The relevant files identified so far are `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py`. Additional focus should be placed on the methods handling query generation, specifically `get_select`, `get_related_selections`, and the methods dealing with setting and managing select masks and related fields.",

Additionally, I looked into `SQLCompiler.get_select` and `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` to see how the SQL is compiled, especially how select related fields are handled. Finally, in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, I examined `Query.get_select_mask` and `Query.add_select_related` to understand the masking of selected fields and how fields are added to the select related list. These sections are crucial for understanding how the query is constructed and executed, especially in context of the reported issue. Specifically, the functions `add_select_related`, `select_related`, `only`, `get_select`, and `get_related_selections` are most relevant as they dictate how fields are selectively loaded and how relationships are decided upon at the SQL level.",
