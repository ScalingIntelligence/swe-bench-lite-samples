            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates a problem with the `only()` method not working correctly with `select_related()` on a reverse OneToOneField relation in Django 4.2. The expected behavior is for the SQL query to include only the specified fields, but it ends up including all fields from the related model. To address this, we need to look at the relevant parts of the Django ORM code that handle these methods and their interactions.\n\n1. **SQLCompiler.get_select()**: This method is responsible for generating the SQL select clause. It includes logic for handling the `select_related` parameter and constructing the SQL based on the selected fields. The issue might be related to how the `select_mask` is being applied when `select_related` is used.\n\n2. **SQLCompiler.get_related_selections()**: This method is crucial for handling the related selections when `select_related` is used. It includes logic for managing the field choices and setting up joins. If the logic for handling the reverse OneToOneField relation is flawed or incomplete, it could lead to the inclusion of all fields.\n\n3. **Query.add_select_related()**: This method is responsible for adding the `select_related` fields to the query. It prepares the field dictionary that is used later in the SQL compilation process. If the dictionary is not set correctly, it could affect the SQL generation.\n\n4. **Query.build_filter()**: Although not directly related to the issue, understanding how filters are built can provide context on how the query construction works and whether there are any related issues.\n\n5. **QuerySet.only() and QuerySet.select_related()**: These methods are the entry points from the Django ORM to the SQL compilation logic. They set up the parameters that will later be used to generate the SQL. If the parameters are not set or propagated correctly, it could lead to unexpected SQL generation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans seem relevant to the reported issue. Specifically, the methods `SQLCompiler.get_select()`, `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections()`, `Query.add_select_related()`, and `QuerySet.only()` are critical for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",
