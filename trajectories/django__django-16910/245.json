The problem appears in Django 4.2 and involves incorrect SQL generation, including all fields from the related model instead of just the specified ones. Relevant files to focus on include `django/db/models/query.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, as they contain the QuerySet methods and SQL query compilation logic that might need adjustments to handle the issue correctly.",

The primary concern is that the SQL query generated by the combination of these methods includes all fields from the related model, which is not expected. This discrepancy between Django 4.2 and earlier versions (like 4.1) needs to be addressed.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the focus should be on methods and functions within the `QuerySet` class and the `Query` class, as these are directly involved in handling the database query operations. Specifically, we need to examine how `select_related()` and `only()` handle field selection and query construction. The `QuerySet.select_related` and `QuerySet.only` methods are key, as they manage the inclusion of related fields and the selective inclusion of fields, respectively.\n\nFurther, the `Query.add_select_related` and `Query.get_select_mask` methods are vital. The former is responsible for adding fields to be selected during the database query when using `select_related()`, and the latter determines which fields to include in the final SQL select statement based on the deferred or only fields specified.\n\nThe `get_related_selections` and `get_default_columns` methods within the `SQLCompiler` class also play a crucial role in how fields are selected and included in the SQL queries. These methods will define the inclusion criteria for fields when related and default columns are involved.\n\nOverall, the task at hand is to trace the interaction of these methods and ensure that when `only()` is called in conjunction with `select_related()` for a reverse OneToOne relation, the SQL query only includes the specified fields, which is not currently happening according to the reported issue.",
