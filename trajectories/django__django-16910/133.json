The provided search results include core components of the Django ORM such as the `Query`, `QuerySet`, and `ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`. These components are crucial for understanding how the ORM constructs queries and handles field selections, especially in the context of related models via `select_related()`.\n\nThe `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` contains methods like `setup_joins()` and `get_select_mask()`. These methods are responsible for setting up how joins are handled and how the selection of fields is managed. This includes checking how the ORM processes different fields and ensures that only the necessary fields are included in the generated SQL query.\n\nThe `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` implements the `select_related()` and `only()` methods. These methods are directly used in the query construction process by the Django ORM. The `select_related()` method is responsible for optimizing the fetching of related objects, while the `only()` method restricts the fields that are retrieved.\n\nThe `ReverseOneToOneDescriptor` class in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` is relevant because it provides the mechanism for accessing reverse OneToOne relationships. The `get_prefetch_queryset()` method in this class is likely involved in how reverse relationships are built and queried.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified spans directly relate to the reported issue, focusing on the areas where the Django ORM deals with the selection of fields and the handling of related models. This should help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue with `only()` and `select_related()`. Therefore, the following spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

The goal is to ensure that only the specified fields are included in the SQL query, not all fields from the related model.\n\nThe `setup_joins` method needs to be updated to handle the `only()` method correctly when `select_related()` is used on a reverse OneToOneField relation. This involves ensuring that only the specified fields are included in the SQL query, which likely requires modifications around the handling of field paths and joins.
