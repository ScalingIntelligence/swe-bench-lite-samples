The provided search results contain relevant code spans from the `QuerySet` class in Django's `django/db/models/query.py`. Specifically, the `QuerySet.only()` method is identified as a key part of the issue, as it is the method responsible for limiting the fields in the query.

The issue is that all fields from the related model are included in the generated SQL, which shouldn't be the case based on the provided fields in the `.only()` method. Reviewing the provided search results, particularly the code spans in `django/db/models/query.py` (spans 'QuerySet.select_related' and 'QuerySet.only') and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` (spans 'Query.get_select_mask' and 'Query.add_select_related'), it appears that these sections of code define the logic for the `only()`, `select_related()`, and related SQL query generation. The 'Query.add_select_related' span specifically handles adding fields to the select_related dictionary, which may be relevant for understanding how the reverse OneToOneField is being handled and why additional fields might be included in the query. Similarly, 'Query.get_select_mask' might provide insight into how the select mask is built, which affects which fields are ultimately selected.
