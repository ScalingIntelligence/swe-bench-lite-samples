The problem is that all fields from the related model are included in the generated SQL, whereas they should be selectively included based on the fields specified in the .only() method. To address this, we need to focus on the logic in Django's ORM that handles the generation of SQL queries for these methods, particularly how the selection of fields is managed when related models are involved. Given the potential complexity of this issue, multiple search parameters should be used to ensure comprehensive coverage of the relevant code.",
