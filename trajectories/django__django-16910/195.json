The generated SQL query includes all fields from the related model, whereas it should only include specified fields. Given the description and the provided models and sample code, the focus should be on the methods and properties related to SQL query generation and field selection, particularly in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py`. These files contain the core logic for SQL compilation and query construction, making them key areas to investigate for the root cause of this issue. Additionally, the `related_descriptors.py` file may also be relevant as it deals with the descriptor classes for related fields.",

This issue requires us to look into the `SQLCompiler`, `Query`, and `QuerySet` classes to understand how they handle the generation of SQL queries with deferred and selected related fields. We need to identify methods responsible for determining the select mask and generating the SQL for the selected fields. From the provided search results, we can pinpoint the following relevant code spans:\n\n1. `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` - This file contains the `SQLCompiler` class which is responsible for compiling the SQL query. We should focus on methods like `get_select()`, `get_extra_select()`, and `get_default_columns()` which handle the generation of the SELECT clause.\n\n2. `django/db/models/sql/query.py` - Here, the `Query` class is defined, and methods like `_get_defer_select_mask()`, `_get_only_select_mask()`, and `get_select_mask()` are crucial for determining which fields should be included in the select mask according to the deferred or only fields specified.\n\n3. `django/db/models/query.py` - This file contains the `QuerySet` class, and methods like `select_related()` and `only()` that users call to manipulate the query set. These methods interact with the query object to add fields to be selected or deferred.\n\nBy analyzing these spans, we can understand how the code processes fields for selection and deferral, especially in the context of reverse OneToOne relationships, and diagnose why the SQL generated includes all fields from the related model.",
