The problem lies in the generation of the SQL query, which includes all fields from the related model instead of only the specified fields. To address this, I need to pinpoint the exact location in the Django source code where the select mask handling for `only()` or `select_related()` might be failing or incorrect. Given the provided context, I will focus on files that handle SQL compilation, query processing, and field-related operations, specifically those that might manipulate or apply select masks for deferred and only fields, as well as related field selections. I will also consider any recent changes in the related modules that could have potentially introduced this regression, comparing the behavior between Django 4.2.1 and Django 4.1.9.",

The issue suggests that the `only()` method is not restricting the fields as expected when used in conjunction with `select_related()`. This implies that the code responsible for generating the SQL query might not be handling the `only()` constraints properly when `select_related()` is also applied.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided search results, several key areas of interest were found within the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files, which are central to query compilation and SQL generation. Specifically, the `SQLCompiler` class's `get_select()` method and the `Query` class's `get_select_mask()` method are likely to contain the logic for handling field selections, including the `only()` and `select_related()` methods. Additionally, the `QuerySet` class's `only()` and `select_related()` methods are directly involved in setting up the query parameters.\n\nI've identified relevant code spans in the `SQLCompiler` and `Query` classes that might be related to the issue, as they deal with field selection and SQL generation.",

The issue states that all fields from the related model are still included in the generated SQL query, which is not the expected behavior. This discrepancy is observed when comparing the generated SQL query in Django 4.2.1 with that of Django 4.1.9. The provided search results include several relevant sections of the Django codebase, particularly in the `django/db/models/sql/` directory. Relevant classes and methods identified include `Query.get_select_mask()`, `Query.add_select_related()`, `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections()`, and `QuerySet.only()`. These methods are critical for understanding how the `select_related` and `only` methods interact with the query generation process. The `get_select_mask()` method, for instance, is responsible for determining which fields should be included in the SELECT clause based on deferred or immediate loading instructions. The `get_related_selections()` method in `SQLCompiler` plays a key role in defining how related fields are handled in the query. The `select_related()` and `only()` methods in `QuerySet` are directly related to the issue, as they are the entry points for specifying select-related fields and immediate loading fields, respectively.",
