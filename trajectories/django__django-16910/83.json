The problem is that the SQL generated by Django 4.2 includes all fields from the related model, whereas the expected behavior is to include only the specified fields. The relevant files and code spans seem to be primarily in the `django/db/models` directory, particularly in files dealing with SQL compilation, query handling, and field relationships. Given the specificity of the issue, focusing on methods like `get_select_mask`, `add_select_related`, and `only` in the `Query` and `QuerySet` classes will likely lead to the root cause of the problem.",

The focus should be on the handling of OneToOneField relations, particularly the reverse relations, within these methods. The `get_default_columns` and `get_related_selections` methods in the `SQLCompiler` class are central to this process, as they determine which columns are included in the SQL SELECT clause and how related objects are managed. By examining these methods and their interactions with the `Query` and `QuerySet` classes, we can identify where the limitation or error occurs in version 4.2 that leads to the inclusion of all fields from the related model, ignoring the `only()` directive.",
