The expected behavior is to only include specified fields in the generated SQL query, but all fields from the related model are being included. This discrepancy between Django 4.1.9 and Django 4.2.1 suggests a regression or change in behavior. The relevant files and methods to investigate include those related to SQL compilation, query processing, and field selection. Specifically, methods like `get_select_mask`, `select_related`, and `only` in the `Query` and `QuerySet` classes, as well as related functions in `compiler.py` and `fields/related_descriptors.py`, should be examined.",

The key points are that the generated SQL includes all fields from the related model instead of only the specified fields. The search results contain several relevant code spans that could be involved in this issue.\n\n1. **django/db/models/sql/query.py**\n   - The `Query.get_select_mask()` method is crucial for determining which fields to include in the query, and it seems to handle the deferred loading of fields. This method could be where the issue lies if the mask is not being applied correctly for reverse OneToOne relations.\n   - The `Query.setup_joins()` method is also relevant as it sets up the joins necessary for related fields, which could impact how fields from related models are included in the query.\n   - The `Query.add_select_related()` method sets up the fields for select_related, and any issues here could manifest in incorrect SQL generation.\n\n2. **django/db/models/sql/compiler.py**\n   - The `SQLCompiler.get_select()` method constructs the `SELECT` clause of the SQL query, which directly relates to the reported issue. If the select_mask or related fields are not handled correctly here, the SQL could include unnecessary fields.\n   - The `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections()` method is responsible for handling related selections, which is directly related to the issue at hand.\n\n3. **django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py**\n   - The `ReverseOneToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset()` method could be relevant if the prefetching behavior is impacting the main query in an unexpected way.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue, addressing aspects such as field selection, query construction, and related field handling.",

The `compiler.py` file contains the `SQLCompiler` class, which is responsible for compiling the query into SQL, including the `get_select` and `get_related_selections` methods, which are key for generating the SELECT clause and handling related selections.
