The user is experiencing a ValueError when attempting to calculate the velocity of a point in a particular reference frame. The expected behavior is that the velocity should be calculated based on the position vector's derivative with respect to the given frame. This functionality seems to be partially implemented for angular velocities but is missing for linear velocities. The search should focus on the `Point` class and its methods, particularly the `vel` method and related position handling methods.",

The provided search results contain code from the Point class in the sympy.physics.vector module. Specifically, the Point class covers the methods for setting and retrieving positions, velocities, and accelerations of points in different reference frames. The vel method is of particular interest as it relates directly to the functionality described in the issue (the calculation of velocity). Moreover, the issue suggests that the current implementation raises a ValueError if the velocity hasn't been defined, which aligns with the current implementation in the vel method. Both the _pdict_list and _check_point methods are also relevant as they deal with the structure and validation of points, which is foundational for the other methods. The locatenew, set_vel, v1pt_theory, and v2pt_theory methods also touch on the concept of velocity in the context of points and frames, making them relevant. Thus, these spans of code are highly relevant to addressing the issue because they provide the basis for implementing a calculation of velocity or improving the error handling mechanism described in the issue.",

The primary method of concern, `vel`, raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been defined for the specified ReferenceFrame. This indicates that the method expects the velocity to be explicitly set before it can be retrieved, rather than computed from position data. The `acc` method, on the other hand, computes acceleration by taking the derivative of velocity or returning a zero vector if the velocity is zero. This suggests that a similar approach could be applied to the `vel` method, whereby it computes velocity from the time derivative of position if the velocity has not been explicitly set. There is no direct evidence in the provided context of methods or logic that currently do this, nor any specific rationale for not implementing such a feature beyond the current design choice. Given this, the search should continue for additional methods in the `Point` class or related classes that handle the derivative of position vectors to compute velocity. It should also explore any documentation or comments in the vicinity of these methods that might discuss why velocity isn't automatically computed from position data.",
