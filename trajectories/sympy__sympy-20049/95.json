To resolve the issue, the `vel` method could potentially be updated to calculate the velocity if it has not been explicitly set.

The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been defined in the reference frame. The search results provided show two files: `frame.py` and `point.py`. The `frame.py` file contains methods related to the `ReferenceFrame` class, such as `ang_vel_in` and `set_ang_vel`, which are relevant because they deal with angular velocity, a related concept to velocity. The `point.py` file contains the `Point` class with methods like `vel`, `set_vel`, `acc`, and others that are directly related to the issue of calculating velocities. Although the current implementation of `vel` raises an error if the velocity is not defined, reviewing the entirety of the code in `point.py` might provide insights on how to implement or adjust the velocity calculation. Given the context and the search results, it seems necessary to look into both the `ReferenceFrame` and `Point` classes to fully address the issue.

Currently, the `vel` method in the `Point` class simply retrieves the velocity from `_vel_dict` and raises an error if it's not defined for the requested frame. This behavior is analogous to how `ang_vel_in` works in the `ReferenceFrame` class, which also retrieves angular velocity from a dictionary (`_ang_vel_dict`). To implement automatic velocity calculation for points, it might be necessary to add logic within the `vel` method that computes the velocity from positional data if it's not explicitly set. One approach could involve leveraging the existing kinematic relationships in methods like `v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory`, which already compute velocities based on relative positions and angular velocities of frames. This would align with the existing pattern of setting velocities based on known quantities and transformations between frames. Further, understanding how these methods use angular velocities from frames could guide how to autocalculate point velocities similarly, potentially adapting the logic used in methods like `ang_vel_in`.",
