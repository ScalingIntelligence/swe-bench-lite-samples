The relevant files and spans seem to be focused on the Point class in `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`, particularly methods handling velocities, positions, and accelerations. Additional support functions like `time_derivative` in `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` could also be relevant for implementing the automatic calculation of velocities based on the position and derivatives of the configuration variables. The goal would be to either modify the existing `vel` method to incorporate automatic differentiation or create a helper method to achieve this functionality.",

The provided file context includes the `Point` class and the `vel` method, which currently raises a ValueError if the velocity hasn't been defined in the specified ReferenceFrame. The expected functionality involves calculating the velocity of a point in a given frame, similar to how the angular velocity works in the referenced frames. The relevant part of the file context is the `vel` method in the `Point` class, which checks if the velocity has been defined and raises an error if not. Additionally, the `set_vel` method is also relevant as it sets the velocity in a specific frame. Another relevant part is the `time_derivative` function in `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py`, which calculates the time derivative of an expression and might be used to calculate the velocity. The file context seems to provide the essential building blocks for addressing the issue, including the `Point` class, its `vel` and `set_vel` methods, and the `time_derivative` function in another file. However, the actual implementation or modification necessary to enable automatic velocity calculations similar to angular velocity might require additional touches within `Point.vel()` or `Point.set_vel()` methods or invoking `time_derivative` appropriately within the `vel` method of `Point` class.",
