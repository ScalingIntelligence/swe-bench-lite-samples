The search results show relevant code spans from both point.py and frame.py. In point.py, the Point class and the vel() method are found, which currently raises a ValueError if the velocity is not defined. This is directly related to the issue. In frame.py, there are multiple methods such as ang_vel_in(), ang_acc_in(), and orient() which are relevant because they deal with angular velocity and orientation, which might provide insights on how to implement or adapt a similar functionality for linear velocity. Therefore, the identified spans focus on the Point.vel() method in point.py and possibly related methods in frame.py that could guide the implementation of velocity calculations for the Point class, potentially using the orientnew() method as a template.",
