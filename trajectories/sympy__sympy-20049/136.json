It's noted that while the angular velocity calculation works as expected between two reference frames, the velocity calculation for points does not. The error trace points to a ValueError in the `vel` method of the `Point` class in the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file. To address this, we need to investigate the `vel` method and potentially implement the desired functionality if it isn't already present. Additionally, understanding how the `point.py` file interacts with the `frame.py` and `vector.py` files could be crucial for a comprehensive fix. Given the error message, we should start by precisely locating the `vel` method and the related `set_vel` method in the `point.py` file.",

Specifically, it mentions that while angular velocity can be calculated between two reference frames, the same cannot be done for velocities of points. This discrepancy is found in the `Point.vel(frame)` method where it raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been defined for that frame. This behavior contrasts with the ability to calculate angular velocity between frames. Given this context, the relevant code spans to address this issue would include the method `Point.vel(frame)` itself and possibly the `Point.set_pos(otherpoint, value)` method since it relates to setting positions which could influence the velocity calculations. Additionally, understanding the implementation of `Point.v1pt_theory` and `Point.v2pt_theory` might provide insights into how to handle velocity calculations in different frames similarly to angular velocity calculations.",

If the velocity is not defined for the given frame, it raises a `ValueError`. This behavior aligns with the issue described, where an error is produced because the velocity has not been defined for the frame. To address this, we need to explore methods in the `point.py`, `frame.py`, `vector.py`, and `functions.py` files that might automatically compute and set velocities based on changes in position and frame orientation. We should specifically look for methods that interact with or are influenced by position updates (`set_pos`), frame orientation changes (`orient`), and angular velocities (`ang_vel_in`). Additionally, the `time_derivative` function in `functions.py` is relevant as it computes derivatives with respect to time, which is crucial for calculating velocities. Therefore, a focused search around these methods and functions is warranted.",
