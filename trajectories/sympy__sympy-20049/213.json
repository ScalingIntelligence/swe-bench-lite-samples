The user expects that if the position of a point is defined relative to another point in a reference frame, the method `vel()` should be able to calculate the velocity accordingly. However, the current implementation raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been specifically defined in the `_vel_dict`. This behavior is contrasted with the functionality of calculating angular velocities, which seems to work fine. The relevance of the search results is evident in the code spans where the `Point` class and its methods are defined. Notably, the method `vel()` is defined in a way that it only checks `_vel_dict` and raises an error if the velocity for the specified frame isn't found there. The defined methods like `v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory` could potentially be relevant if further extended to automatically calculate velocities based on position changes, akin to how angular velocities are calculated. Hence, these methods and the current structure of `vel()` suggest areas where improvements or additional functionality could be added to achieve the desired behavior.",

The provided context shows the current implementation of the `Point` class and its associated methods. The new search results include various files related to the physics vector module, but none directly addresses the issue of implementing or fixing the `vel` method. Given the current context and search results, it seems that the necessary code to resolve the issue, particularly modifying or enhancing the `vel` method, is already presented in the context.

The relevant parts of the code to address this issue are found in the `point.py` file, specifically the methods `vel`, `set_vel`, `v1pt_theory`, and `v2pt_theory`. These methods handle the velocity calculations and assignments. Additionally, the `frame.py` file contains the `ReferenceFrame` class, which is relevant for understanding the frame's angular velocities needed for calculating point velocities in different frames. The `functions.py` file contains utility functions like `cross` and `dot` which might be useful for implementing new functionality or verifying existing calculations.
