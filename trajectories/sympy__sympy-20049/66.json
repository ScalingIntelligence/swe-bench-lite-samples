To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the `sympy.physics.vector.point` module that handle velocity calculations. The key sections to focus on are the initialization of the `Point` class, which sets up the dictionaries `_vel_dict` to store velocities, and the `vel` method itself, which fetches the velocity based on the frame. If the velocity is not defined, it raises a ValueError, which is the behavior we need to modify. To implement the suggested functionality, we also need to ensure that velocity is automatically calculated based on position changes similar to how angular velocities are calculated for reference frames.",
