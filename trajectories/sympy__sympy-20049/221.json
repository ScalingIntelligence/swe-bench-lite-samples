The user expects that specifying the position of points in different reference frames should allow the calculation of velocities between those points, similar to how angular velocities can be calculated between reference frames. However, currently, the `Point.vel()` method raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been explicitly defined for the given reference frame. The relevant code spans identified in the search results include the `Point.__init__`, `Point.v1pt_theory`, `Point.v2pt_theory`, and `Point.vel` methods. The `Point.v1pt_theory` and `Point.v2pt_theory` methods are particularly relevant as they deal with calculating velocities based on position vectors in different frames, which is directly related to the issue. The `Point.vel` method is also crucial as it is the method that currently raises the `ValueError` when the velocity is not defined. To address the issue, one approach could be to modify the `Point.vel` method to automatically calculate the velocity if it has not been explicitly defined, similar to how the position vectors are used in `Point.v1pt_theory` and `Point.v2pt_theory` to calculate velocities. This would involve likely adding a computation of velocity from the position vector and its derivatives in the `Point.vel` method, which is not currently present but implied by the user's expectation that it should work analogously to angular velocity calculations.",

Notably, the 'vel' method raises a `ValueError` if the velocity for a specific reference frame hasn't been explicitly set, which is the root cause of the problem. In contrast, the 'ReferenceFrame' class handles angular velocity with methods like 'ang_vel_in' and 'set_ang_vel', which suggest a pattern that could potentially be applied to linear velocity based on position. To derive velocity from position effectively, it's worth exploring how 'pos_from' and 'set_pos' interact with the velocity and acceleration methods in the 'Point' class, and how changes in position over time (like through 'dt' method on a Vector for time derivative) could be incorporated to calculate velocity automatically when not explicitly set.",
