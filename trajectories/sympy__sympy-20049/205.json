The user expects that if the position between two points is set, calculating the velocity in a specified frame should be possible. However, currently, the `vel` method raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been explicitly set for the specified frame. This suggests that the method lacks the capability to automatically derive the velocity based on the position and orientation information provided. The search results show the relevant `Point` class with its methods, including `vel`, `set_vel`, `pos_from`, and `set_pos`. These methods are likely to be involved in addressing the reported issue. Specifically, the `vel` method checks if the velocity is defined in the dictionary `_vel_dict` for the given frame, and if not, it raises the `ValueError`. To address the issue, it may be necessary to implement logic within the `vel` method to calculate the velocity based on the position and orientation if it hasn't been explicitly set. This would likely involve integrating the existing methods for position setting and frame orientation to derive the velocity without explicit prior definition.",

The code spans related to Point.set_pos, Point.vel, and the derivative-related functions (like time_derivative and _process_vector_differential) are particularly relevant because they either currently perform operations used to calculate velocity or contain the functionality needed to implement a new method for calculating velocity from position accurately.",
