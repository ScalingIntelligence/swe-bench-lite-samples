To resolve this, we need to find or implement logic within the `vel` method that calculates the velocity based on the position if it hasn't been explicitly set. Given the reference frames and orientations can calculate angular velocities, it's reasonable to expect the velocities can also be deduced similarly.",

The issue describes a scenario where angular velocity can be calculated between two reference frames but not linear velocity, which should behave similarly. The provided search results contain several key methods in the `Point` class within `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`, such as `vel()`, `pos_from()`, and `set_vel()`, which are directly related to position and velocity handling. Additionally, the `time_derivative()` function from `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` is crucial for the computation of time derivatives, which is relevant for velocity computations. To resolve the issue, it may be necessary to integrate the logic from these methods with the existing angular velocity calculation logic. This approach could involve setting the velocity based on the position's time derivative, thus extending functionality to support the desired calculations.",
