The method raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been explicitly defined for the specified frame.

To address this, we should either adjust the `vel` method to calculate the derivative of the position vector with respect to time if no velocity has been set explicitly, or ensure that the velocity is set when the position is set. Additionally, we should consider whether similar adjustments are needed for acceleration (acc method) and position handling.",

This functionality seems to work for angular velocity but not for linear velocity. The current implementation of `vel` method raises a `ValueError` if the velocity is not set for the given frame. The expected behavior is to calculate the velocity based on the positional derivatives if possible. From the search results, the relevant code spans are those that deal with velocity calculation and setting, as well as those that handle the positional data. Specifically, the methods `vel`, `set_vel`, `pos_from`, and `set_pos` are directly related to the issue. These methods either check for the existence of velocity or set it, and thus are key to implementing the desired functionality. Additionally, the method `acc` is relevant because it calculates acceleration based on velocity, which could be impacted by changes in the velocity calculation logic. The method `_pdict_list` is also likely relevant for managing positional relationships, which are fundamental to determining velocities.\n\nThe primary issue is in the `vel` method where it fails if the velocity is not already defined. This logic should be modified to calculate the velocity using positional derivatives if the velocity has not been explicitly set. It seems that implementing the expected behavior would involve overriding the current behavior in the `vel` method or creating a new method that performs the velocity calculation when not explicitly set.",
