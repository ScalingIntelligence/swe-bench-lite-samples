The user provided an example where the velocity is not being computed when it should be based on the position defined. This is demonstrated by the ValueError encountered when calling `Q.vel(A)`. The relevant code spans in the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file are the `vel` method itself, the `set_vel` method, and the `pos_from` method, which are all involved in calculating or setting the velocity of a point. Additionally, the `a1pt_theory` and `v1pt_theory` methods involve calculations related to velocity and acceleration. The `sympy/physics/vector/frame.py` file contains methods related to angular velocity (`ang_vel_in`) which might also be relevant to understanding the context of velocity calculations, but based on the issue, the focus should be primarily on the `Point` class. The task aims to identify if these methods solve the issue or if additional implementation is needed for the `vel` method to work as expected.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
