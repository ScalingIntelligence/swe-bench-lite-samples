The user expects that `Point.vel()` can calculate the velocity just like the angular velocity for reference frames. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been defined for the given reference frame. The relevant parts of the code are in `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` where the `Point` class and its methods are defined, particularly the `Point.vel()` method. Additionally, the `time_derivative` function in `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` might be relevant for calculating derivatives, which could be used to implement the velocity calculation. However, the issue is about the absence of handling for undefined velocities in `Point.vel()`, which is not addressed by `time_derivative`.

These methods suggest that there's an attempt to manage velocity calculations but fall short due to the explicit check in `vel(self, frame)` that raises a ValueError if the velocity hasn't been explicitly set for the frame.

This suggests that the implementation might be missing a step where it calculates the velocity from the position if it hasn't been set directly.
