The search results provide detailed information about the `Point` class and its methods, including `vel`, `set_vel`, `pos_from`, and others. These methods are responsible for managing the position and velocity of points in different reference frames. The `vel` method is directly related to the issue as it attempts to retrieve the velocity of a point in a specified frame, and it currently throws an error if the velocity hasn't been defined. The `set_vel` method is also relevant as it allows setting the velocity of a point in a specific frame. To resolve the issue, one might need to modify the `vel` method to compute the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set, similar to how angular velocities are handled in the reference frames. Relevant code spans include the `vel` method itself and possibly the `set_vel` method, as well as others that interact with the velocity and position data of points.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
