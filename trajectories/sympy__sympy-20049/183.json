The user expects that if the orientation between two reference frames can be calculated (as demonstrated with angular velocity), then the linear velocity should also be calculable. The current implementation of `Point.vel()` raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been explicitly defined in the specified reference frame. The search results show the relevant parts of the `Point` class, including methods like `__init__`, `vel`, `acc`, and other related methods that deal with velocity and acceleration. These methods use dictionaries to store and retrieve velocity and acceleration values for different reference frames. The key method here is `vel`, which raises the `ValueError`. To address the issue, the method should be modified to calculate the velocity if it has not been explicitly set, similar to how the angular velocity is calculated in other methods. This would involve implementing logic similar to what is done in the `acc` method, which calculates the acceleration if the velocity is non-zero.",

The expected behavior is for `Q.vel(A)` to calculate the velocity by differentiating the position vector with respect to time in the given frame. The code analysis shows that the `Point` class and its methods are responsible for handling point positions and velocities. Relevant methods include `vel`, `set_vel`, `pos_from`, and `set_pos`, which manage velocities and positions, respectively. To address the issue, the `vel` method should be updated to automatically calculate the velocity if it's not explicitly set, similar to how angular velocity is calculated for reference frames. This involves implementing the differentiation of the position vector with respect to time in the specified frame. Additionally, understanding the context in which velocities are set and retrieved is crucial for ensuring that the implementation aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue. The proposed solution is to modify the `vel` method to calculate the derivative of the position vector with respect to time if the velocity is not explicitly defined in the given frame, thus eliminating the need for an explicit error raise. This approach mirrors the functionality available for angular velocities in reference frames.",

This doesn't currently work in the `Point` class of the SymPy physics module, specifically in the `vel` method. The expected behavior is that `Q.vel(A)` should return `q'*A.x + 2*q'*A.y`, which is the derivative of the position vector `r` with respect to the reference frame `A`. Currently, the `vel` method raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been defined in the specified reference frame. The search results include relevant code spans from the `Point` class, such as the `vel`, `acc`, `set_vel`, and `set_acc` methods, which deal with velocity and acceleration computations. Additionally, the `time_derivative` function from the `functions.py` file is relevant because it computes the time derivative of expressions, which is necessary for calculating velocities. These code spans are relevant to the issue as they directly relate to the functionality of calculating velocities and accelerations within the physics module. The task is complete as the relevant spans have been identified and correspond to the calculations needed to implement the new functionality or fix the reported issue.",

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
