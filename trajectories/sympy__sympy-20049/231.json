Specifically, the issue outlines that while the angular velocity can be calculated between two reference frames, the same cannot be done for linear velocities. The provided example demonstrates that the `Q.vel(A)` method raises a ValueError because the velocity has not been defined in the specified ReferenceFrame. The expected behavior is for the method to calculate the velocity based on the position vector's derivative with respect to the ReferenceFrame. \n\nUpon reviewing the `Point` class in the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file, it is evident that the `vel` method checks if the velocity exists in the `_vel_dict` for the given frame. If not, it raises a ValueError. This is exactly the behavior observed in the reported issue. Further examination shows that the `set_vel` method is available to set the velocity in a specific frame. However, there's no automatic calculation of velocity based on position, which seems to be the desired functionality.\n\nThe relevant code spans include the `Point.__init__`, `Point.vel`, `Point.set_vel`, and `Point.pos_from` methods. These code spans cover the initialization of the velocity dictionary, the retrieval of velocity with the problematic method, the method to set velocity manually, and the method to get the position vector between points, which is likely needed to calculate velocity.\n\nGiven the analysis, it is recommended to implement a method within the `Point` class that automatically calculates and sets the velocity based on the derivative of the position vector with respect to the given frame. This new functionality, when implemented, would address the reported issue by eliminating the need to manually set velocities.",

The issue indicates that the current implementation of `vel` raises a ValueError if the velocity hasn't been set in the specified reference frame, which is inconsistent with the user's expectations. The file context is comprehensive enough to understand the current behavior and to identify the necessary modifications to implement the desired functionality. Therefore, searching for more specific code implementations beyond the `Point` class and its methods within the provided file context is not necessary.",
