This issue is similar to the functionality that exists for calculating angular velocities between reference frames. The key files to focus on are those related to Points (`point.py`) and ReferenceFrames (`frame.py`). The `vel` method in the `Point` class is central to the issue, and the `ang_vel_in` method in the `ReferenceFrame` class provides a useful comparison. Additionally, the `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` file might contain utility functions that could be relevant.",

Additionally, the 'Point.set_vel' method and 'Point.pos_from' method are relevant as they could be utilized or modified to achieve the desired functionality of automatically calculating velocity if not explicitly defined. The 'frame.py' file also contains relevant code spans, such as 'ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in', which might be helpful if angular velocities are related to linear velocities in this context.

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
