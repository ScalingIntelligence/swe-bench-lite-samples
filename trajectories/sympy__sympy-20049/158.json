The expected behavior is for the method to calculate the velocity if it's possible, given the relative position set by `set_pos`. This is similar to how the `ang_vel_in` method works for ReferenceFrame. Given the context, the main focus should be on the Point class in the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file, where the `vel` method is defined. Other relevant files might include `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` for general vector operations, and perhaps `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` for utility functions related to velocity and acceleration calculations.",

The user expects the method `Q.vel(A)` to calculate the velocity based on the position vector `r` defined between two points P and Q in reference frame A. The current implementation of `Point.vel` raises a ValueError if the velocity has not been explicitly set for the point in the specified frame. The search results include relevant spans from the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file, which contains the implementation of the Point class and its methods related to velocity. The identified spans include the `vel` method, which currently raises the ValueError, and other related methods such as `set_vel`, `v1pt_theory`, and `v2pt_theory`. These methods are designed to handle the setting and calculation of velocities, suggesting that improvements to the `vel` method to automatically calculate velocity based on position and time derivatives could address the reported issue. Additionally, the `time_derivative` function in `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` could be relevant for calculating the velocity if the position vector is known, aligning with the user's expectation that the velocity should be derivable from position if there's an associated linear velocity between frames.",

The user expects that `Q.vel(A)` should compute the velocity given the position vector `r` and the angular velocity of the reference frame. The current `Point.vel()` method raises a ValueError if the velocity has not been explicitly set for the given frame, rather than calculating it based on the position and frame's angular velocity. This behavior is inconsistent with the calculation of angular velocities, which are computed automatically. To address this, the `Point.vel()` method should be modified to calculate the velocity based on the position vector and the frame's angular velocity if it has not been explicitly set. The relevant code spans are those that define the `Point` class and its methods, particularly `Point.vel()`, `Point.set_vel()`, and `Point.pos_from()`, which work together to define and retrieve the velocity and position vectors.",

This aligns with the reported issue, which states that velocity calculations are not performed automatically based on the position settings. There is no method in the provided context that computes velocity directly from position. Additionally, the `time_derivative` function in `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` calculates the time derivative of expressions, including those involving Vectors, but this is not directly tied to the `Point` class's position-to-velocity functionality.

This contrasts with the functionality of angular velocity calculations. The expected behavior is to derive the velocity from the position vector when the velocity hasn't been explicitly set. The current implementation of `Point.vel()` only returns a value if it's already present in `self._vel_dict`. To address the issue, the `Point.vel()` method should be modified to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set. This involves taking the time derivative of the position vector, which is currently handled by the `time_derivative` function in `functions.py`.
