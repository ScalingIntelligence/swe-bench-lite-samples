The error occurs when attempting to calculate the velocity of a point in a specific reference frame, and it seems that the method does not handle the calculation if the velocity has not been explicitly set. Given the similarity in functionality between angular and linear velocities in the context of reference frames, there's a clear need to implement or enhance the `vel` method in the Point class to automatically calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly defined, similar to how angular velocities are handled. The issue expects that the velocity should be calculated based on the position's time derivative in the given frame, as demonstrated with `r.dt(A)`.",

The issue suggests that the velocity should be calculated based on the position if possible, similar to how angular velocity is calculated.
