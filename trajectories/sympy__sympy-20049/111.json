The expected behavior is for the velocity to be automatically calculated if the position is known and the frame's angular velocity exists. The search results include the 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py' file, which has several relevant code spans. The spans titled 'Point.vel', 'Point.set_vel', and 'Point.pos_from' are of particular interest. 'Point.vel' currently raises a ValueError if the velocity is not explicitly set, which aligns with the user's issue. 'Point.set_vel' is used to set the velocity, and 'Point.pos_from' is used to calculate the position from another point, which might be relevant for automatically calculating the velocity. The spans 'Point.v1pt_theory' and 'Point.v2pt_theory' also involve calculating velocities and could provide insights into how to address the issue, specifically how to adjust or expand the 'vel' method to account for automatically calculated velocities based on position and angular velocity.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
