The current implementation of `Point.vel()` in the provided code raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been defined for the given reference frame. The goal is to modify this behavior so that if the velocity is not explicitly defined, the method tries to calculate it based on the position derivatives. This aligns with the desired behavior described in the issue, where the velocity should be calculated automatically rather than requiring explicit definition. The relevant code spans to address this might include the `Point.vel()` method, which needs to be updated to include a calculation for velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set, and potentially other methods like `Point.set_pos()` or `Point.pos_from()` that might play a role in determining the velocity. These methods were identified because they are directly related to the position and velocity properties of the Point class, which are central to the issue at hand.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
