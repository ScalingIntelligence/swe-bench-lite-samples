The `Point.vel()` method is expected to calculate the velocity if possible, similar to how angular velocity is calculated between reference frames. The current implementation raises a ValueError when attempting to calculate the velocity of a point that has not had its velocity explicitly set in a given reference frame. To resolve this, we need to investigate the `Point` class and related methods in the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file, particularly the `vel` and `set_vel` methods. Additionally, since the issue involves the handling of positions and velocities, the `set_pos` and `pos_from` methods may also be relevant. The `ReferenceFrame` class in `sympy/physics/vector/frame.py` is also relevant, as it includes methods for handling angular velocities and may provide insights into how velocities could be handled more gracefully in the `Point` class.",

To address this, we need to investigate how to calculate velocity based on the positions set and perhaps apply the same or similar logic used for angular velocity calculations in the ReferenceFrame class. The relevant code spans identified include the initialization of the Point class, the vel method in the Point class, and the ang_vel_in method in the ReferenceFrame class.
