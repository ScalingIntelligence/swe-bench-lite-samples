This functionality works for angular velocity, but not for linear velocity. The relevant code spans in the search results are those related to the Point class and its methods, especially those handling velocity (vel), position (pos_from), and setting velocity (set_vel). The method vel is crucial as it directly relates to the calculation and retrieval of a point's velocity. The ValueError mentioned in the issue is thrown by the vel method, indicating that the velocity has not been defined for the specified frame. Therefore, enhancing the vel method to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set (similar to how angular velocities are handled) could address the reported issue. This involves examining how the method sets and retrieves velocities and potentially modifying it to incorporate automatic calculation. The method set_pos, which sets the position of one point relative to another, might also be relevant if the velocity calculation relies on position changes over time.",
