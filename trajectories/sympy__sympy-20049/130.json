The expected behavior, as detailed in the issue, involves calculating the time derivative of the position vector, which should ideally be handled within the Point.vel method. This functionality likely requires modifications in the Point class within 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py' to incorporate the computation logic similar to what is done in the 'time_derivative' function in 'sympy/physics/vector/functions.py'. Additionally, examining the 'ReferenceFrame' class in 'sympy/physics/vector/frame.py' is crucial because it contains methods related to angular velocity and acceleration, which hint at the potential missing computations for linear velocities. Implementing the missing functionality in 'Point.vel' could leverage logic from both 'time_derivative' and possibly 'ang_vel_in' or 'ang_acc_in' from the 'ReferenceFrame' class. Further, the issue suggests a correlation between the working functionality for angular velocities and the non-working for linear velocities, indicating that understanding how angular velocities are handled could offer insights into how to implement or error-check the linear velocity computation.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
