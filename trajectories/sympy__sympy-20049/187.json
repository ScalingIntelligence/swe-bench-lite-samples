Specifically, the method `vel` raises a `ValueError` when a point's velocity has not been defined in the specified reference frame, as seen in the example provided in the issue. There are several methods in the `Point` class that interact with velocities, positions, and accelerations in various reference frames. For instance, methods like `a1pt_theory`, `a2pt_theory`, `v1pt_theory`, and `v2pt_theory` define how velocities and accelerations are set and calculated between points and frames. Given the issue's request to ideally set and compute velocities similarly to positions, the relevant code spans include the initialization and settings of velocities (`vel`, `set_vel`) and methods that apply velocity theories (`v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory`). These are crucial for understanding the current implementation and potentially modifying it to meet the issue's requirements. Additionally, the `ang_vel_in` method from the `ReferenceFrame` class in `sympy/physics/vector/frame.py` is relevant as it aligns with the request to compute velocities akin to the computation of angular velocities.",

The expected behavior is to return the derivative of the position vector in the given reference frame, similar to what is done for angular velocity. The search results provide the complete implementation of the 'Point' class, including all methods and attributes. The 'vel' method in question is found in the search results, along with related methods such as 'set_vel' for setting the velocity and 'pos_from' for calculating the position vector from another point. The current implementation of 'vel' raises a ValueError if the velocity hasn't been explicitly set in the given reference frame, which matches the observed behavior in the reported issue.
