The error message suggests that the velocity has not been defined for the specified reference frame, even though it should be calculable based on the given position and orientation.

The relevant classes and methods to investigate are `Point` in 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py' and `ReferenceFrame` in 'sympy/physics/vector/frame.py'. Additionally, it would be beneficial to look at the `time_derivative` function in 'sympy/physics/vector/functions.py' to understand how derivatives are computed, which is crucial for velocity calculations.",

The relevant code spans are identified in the Point class methods, particularly the vel, set_vel, v1pt_theory, and v2pt_theory methods. These methods are responsible for handling velocity calculations and assignments for points. Additionally, the time_derivative function in the functions.py file is relevant as it is used for calculating derivatives with respect to time, which is necessary for computing velocity.

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
