Specifically, there's a problem where the velocity of a point is not being calculated as expected when using the `vel` method. The expected behavior is evident from the direct calculation of the time derivative of the position vector. This suggests that the `vel` method in the `Point` class might not be properly implemented to automatically calculate velocities based on the positions set by `set_pos`. To address this issue, we need to search the `Point` class and related methods within the `sympy/physics/vector` directory to identify the relevant code sections.",

This suggests that relevant code would involve modifying the `vel` method to include velocity calculations based on positions if not explicitly set, similar to the example given in the issue.

This contrasts with the behavior of angular velocity calculations, which work seamlessly. The expected behavior outlined by the user suggests that the velocity should be derivable from the position vector if not explicitly set. The current implementation of the `vel` method raises a ValueError if the velocity has not been defined for the requested frame. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle positional and velocity calculations. The `Point.vel` method, `Point.pos_from`, and `Point.set_pos` methods are the most relevant as they are directly involved in managing position and velocity data. Additionally, the `Point.set_vel` method should be considered for setting velocity if not already defined. Based on the search results, the relevant code spans are those that define the `vel`, `pos_from`, `set_pos`, and `set_vel` methods within the `Point` class in the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file.
