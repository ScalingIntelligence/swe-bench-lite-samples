This functionality is already implemented for angular velocity calculations in the `ReferenceFrame` class.

The `Point` class and its methods like `vel`, `set_vel`, `v1pt_theory`, and `v2pt_theory` are closely related to the task.

Specifically, it notes that while angular velocities can be calculated between two reference frames, linear velocities cannot, and it raises a `ValueError`. The expected result is a calculation of the linear velocity and its derivative with respect to the frame. The search results include the `Point` class with methods like `vel`, `set_vel`, and theories for calculating velocities. Since the issue is already partially addressed in the initial context by the `vel` method raising a `ValueError`, the most relevant code spans to address the issue would be those related to actual velocity calculation and setting, such as `set_vel`, `v1pt_theory`, and `v2pt_theory`. These methods are found in the new search results and align with the functionality needed to address the issue.",

The expected behavior is for the method to calculate the velocity based on the position and its time derivatives. Reviewing the existing code and the new search results, the `Point` class in `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` contains methods related to setting and retrieving velocities (e.g., `set_vel`, `v1pt_theory`, `v2pt_theory`) but the `vel` method itself does not perform the calculation if the velocity is not pre-defined. To address the issue, the `vel` method needs to be updated to calculate the velocity based on the position's time derivative, similarly to how the angular velocity is handled in the reference frames. The `time_derivative` function from `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` can be used for this purpose. The relevant code spans include the entire `Point` class methods for velocity and the `time_derivative` function.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
