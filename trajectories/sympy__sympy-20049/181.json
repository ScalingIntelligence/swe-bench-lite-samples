The reported issue notes that while it's possible to calculate angular velocity between two reference frames, the same doesn't hold true for linear velocities. The expected behavior is that providing the position vectors should automatically calculate the velocity. \n\nUpon examining the `point.py` file, several relevant code spans are identified: \n1. The `Point` class definition which contains methods related to position, velocity, and acceleration calculations.\n2. The `Point.vel` method itself, which raises a ValueError if the velocity has not been defined in the specified ReferenceFrame.\n3. The `Point.set_vel` method, which sets the velocity of the point in a specified ReferenceFrame.\n4. The `Point.pos_from` method, which calculates the position vector from another point.\n5. The `Point.v1pt_theory` and `Point.v2pt_theory` methods, which set the velocity of the point using relative velocities and angular velocities.\n\nGiven the issue's context, the focus should be on enhancing the `Point.vel` method to automatically calculate velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set, leveraging the position vector and its time derivative. This aligns with the functionality seen in the `time_derivative` function in the `functions.py` file, which computes the time derivative of expressions either as a vector or a dyadic.\n\nThe existing setup is robust but lacks automatic derivation for velocity in the absence of an explicit definition. Therefore, the solution would involve modifying the `Point.vel` method within the `Point` class to include the logic for automatically calculating the velocity using position vectors and their derivatives.",

The expected behavior is for it to calculate the velocity based on the position derivative if it has not been explicitly set. The current implementation of `Point.vel` only returns a stored velocity or raises an error if it hasn't been set.

The `Point.vel` method currently checks if the velocity is in the `_vel_dict` and raises a `ValueError` if not. This is the main point needing to be addressed.\n\nAdditionally, the `time_derivative` function in `functions.py` is relevant as it calculates the time derivative of expressions, which would be needed to compute the velocity from the position.

The method raises a ValueError if the velocity hasn't been explicitly set for a particular frame, which is the primary issue described. To address this, an enhancement could involve automatically calculating the velocity based on the time derivative of the position vector, similar to how accelerations are handled in the `acc` method. This approach would integrate well with the `time_derivative` function from `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py`, which computes the time derivative of an expression with respect to a given reference frame. By adapting this functionality to the `vel` method, we can ensure that velocities are automatically derived from positions where they haven't been explicitly set.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
