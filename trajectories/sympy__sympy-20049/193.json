The current implementation in the 'Point' class raises a ValueError if the velocity for a specific frame hasn't been defined. The issue is suggesting that velocity should be calculable by default, similar to how angular velocity is calculated. The relevant code spans are within the 'Point' class, specifically the 'vel' method, which currently checks if the velocity is in the '_vel_dict'. If not, it raises an error. The solution might involve modifying this method to automatically calculate velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set. This would require understanding how to compute the velocity as suggested by the example, potentially involving time derivatives of position vectors. Related methods like 'pos_from' and 'set_pos' could also be relevant for understanding the point's position, which is necessary for calculating velocity. Additionally, the 'locatenew' method defines new points, and understanding how positions are set and managed could be crucial for the overall context.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
