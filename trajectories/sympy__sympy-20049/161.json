The expected behavior is to compute the velocity based on the position vector's time derivative as demonstrated.

Specifically, the issue is that the `vel` method raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been defined in the specified reference frame, whereas the user expects it to calculate the velocity based on the position vector and its derivatives. This behavior is inconsistent with the functionality available for calculating angular velocities. The provided search results include the `Point` class definition with various methods, including `vel`, `set_vel`, `pos_from`, and others. These methods deal with position, velocity, and acceleration in different reference frames. The `vel` method's current implementation solely checks if the velocity is already defined in the specified frame and raises an error if not. There is no attempt to dynamically calculate the velocity based on the position or other available data. Based on the issue description, the desired outcome is for the `vel` method to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set, similar to how derivatives of the position vector (`r.dt(A)` in the example) are used to determine velocity. This would require modifying or extending the `vel` method to include a calculation step using the `pos_from` method or similar approaches to derive the velocity from position data when it is not pre-defined. Thus, the relevant code spans are those that include the `vel` method and any related methods that could potentially help in implementing the desired functionality (like those dealing with position or derivatives).",

The method 'vel' is intended to calculate the velocity of a point with respect to a reference frame, but it currently raises a ValueError if the velocity hasn't been explicitly defined for the requested frame. This suggests that the method might need an enhancement to automatically compute the velocity if it hasn't been set, similar to how the position vector's derivative is expected to be used as demonstrated in the issue. The rest of the class includes methods for handling position, acceleration, and setting velocity, which can provide context for how to address the issue.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
