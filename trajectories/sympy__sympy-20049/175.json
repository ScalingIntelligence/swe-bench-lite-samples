This behavior aligns with the issue reported, where the velocity calculation is not provided by default and must be explicitly set using methods like `set_vel(frame, value)`. To fix the issue, modifications would likely be needed in the `vel(frame)` method or related methods to automatically calculate velocity if not explicitly set.

The issue described involves a scenario where the velocity calculation between two points in different reference frames is not implemented, resulting in a ValueError. From the provided context, it is clear that the current implementation requires the velocity to be explicitly set using the `set_vel` method before it can be retrieved with the `vel` method.

The user expects that if the position of a point has been set relative to another point, calling Q.vel(A) should calculate the velocity based on the position's derivative with respect to the frame A.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans include:\n1. The 'Point.vel' span, which contains the current implementation of the vel method.\n2. The 'Point.set_pos' span, which is relevant as setting the position is a prerequisite for calculating velocity.\n3. The 'Point.pos_from' span, which is used to obtain the position from another point, potentially useful for calculating derivatives.\n4. The 'Point' class initialization span ('Point.__init__'), which initializes the dictionaries for positions, velocities, and accelerations.\n\nThese spans provide the necessary context and code to understand how the Point class handles positions and velocities. The 'Point.vel' method specifically needs to be modified to automatically calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue.",

The issue described involves a scenario where the velocity calculation between two points in different reference frames is not implemented, resulting in a ValueError. From the provided context, it is clear that the current implementation requires the velocity to be explicitly set using the `set_vel` method before it can be retrieved with the `vel` method.

From the provided context and search results, it's clear that the `Point.vel()` method currently raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been explicitly set for the given frame. The proposed solution is to modify this behavior to automatically calculate the velocity based on positional data, similar to how the angular velocity is computed. This would involve revising the `vel` method to include the necessary computation or to link it to the positioning logic in a more direct manner. The related methods `set_pos`, `pos_from`, and `set_vel` would also be relevant to understand the complete flow and to determine how best to integrate the new functionality, though they are not directly responsible for the issue at hand. The search results provided all the relevant code spans necessary to address the issue, including the `Point.__init__`, `Point.vel`, and potentially other methods that interact with velocity and position data.",

The `pos_from` method calculates the position of the point relative to another point by summing up the positions along the chain of points.

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
