The current behavior results in a ValueError when trying to calculate the velocity of a point in a reference frame without explicitly setting the velocity. The desired functionality is to automatically calculate the velocity if the position vector is known, similar to how angular velocity is handled for reference frames. Given the context, the most relevant file seems to be `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`, which contains the `Point` class with the `vel` method. Additionally, the `ReferenceFrame` class in `sympy/physics/vector/frame.py` might be relevant since it interacts with points and their velocities in the physics.vector module. The function `time_derivative` in `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` could also be useful for calculating derivatives, including velocity, if it's not already implemented.",

The provided search results include the 'Point' class definition along with several methods related to point dynamics such as position, velocity, and acceleration. The critical method identified in the issue, 'Point.vel()', is present in the search results and throws a ValueError when the velocity is not previously defined for the given frame. This behavior directly corresponds to the issue described. The relevant code spans are the 'Point' class definition and the 'Point.vel()' method. These components should be evaluated and potentially modified to address the expected functionality of dynamically calculating velocity if positions are defined, analogous to the way angular velocities are handled.",

This can be improved by using the `time_derivative` function from `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` to calculate the velocity automatically if the position is known. Examining the `set_pos` method in the `Point` class shows how positions are set and managed, which could be integrated with the velocity calculation.

The expected behavior is to automatically calculate the velocity if it hasn't been set, similar to how angular velocity is handled in the `ReferenceFrame` class.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code, the `Point.vel()` method currently checks if the velocity has been defined in a specific frame and raises an error if not. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected result shown in the issue.\n\nGiven the code context and the issue description, the relevant parts of the code are:\n- sympy/physics/vector/point.py, specifically the `Point.vel()` method.\n- sympy/physics/vector/functions.py, specifically the `time_derivative()` function, which might be used to compute the velocity if not explicitly defined.\n\nTo address the issue, the `Point.vel()` method should be updated to compute the velocity using `time_derivative()` if it hasn't been explicitly set for a frame.
