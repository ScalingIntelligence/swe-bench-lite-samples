The search results focus on the `Point` class within the `sympy.physics.vector` module. The relevant code spans are those that deal directly with the velocity calculation and storage, particularly the `Point.vel` and `Point.set_vel` methods. These methods are responsible for retrieving and setting the velocity of a point in a given reference frame. The issue seems to stem from the fact that the velocity has not been explicitly set in the `vel_dict` for the reference frame 'A', leading to the ValueError. To address this, the code might need a mechanism to automatically calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly defined, similar to how orientations are handled. This could involve either modifying the `vel` method to calculate the velocity on the fly using the positions and their derivatives, or adding a new method that manages this calculation transparently.",

The issue provides an example where setting the position of a point relative to another point does not result in the calculation of the velocity, leading to a `ValueError`. The expected behavior is for the `Q.vel(A)` call to return the derivative of the position with respect to time, as shown in the expected result. Current context and new search results both point to the `Point.vel()` method, which raises the `ValueError` because the velocity has not been defined in the specified reference frame. Relevant methods include `Point.set_pos()`, `Point.pos_from()`, and `Point.set_vel()`, as these are related to setting and getting positions and velocities. The solution might involve modifying the `Point.vel()` method to automatically calculate the velocity based on the position if it has not been explicitly set.",

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
