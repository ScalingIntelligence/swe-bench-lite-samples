This suggests that the method `Point.vel()` needs to be enhanced to handle such cases. Given the search results, the relevant code spans can be found in the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file, particularly in the implementation of the `Point` class, which includes methods related to position, velocity, and acceleration. The methods `Point.vel()` and `Point.set_vel()` are directly related to the functionality described in the issue, as they handle the velocity of points in different reference frames. Therefore, these code spans are likely relevant for addressing the reported issue.",

The current implementation of `Point.vel()` raises a `ValueError` if the velocity is not already defined in the specified reference frame. The expected behavior is to calculate the velocity if it is possible, similar to how the angular velocity is calculated. This suggests that we need to introduce a mechanism to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set. Given the provided context and search results, we can see that the `dt` method in both `Dyadic` and `Vector` classes can be utilized for the derivative calculation over time. This derivative calculation aligns with the expected result shown in the issue, which is the derivative of the position vector `r` over time.

The `vel(self, frame)` method in this class currently raises a ValueError if the velocity hasn't been explicitly set for the specified frame. This suggests that there is a gap in the automatic calculation of velocity from position derivatives when it's not explicitly set. Additionally, methods like `v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory` directly set velocity based on other points and frames, but they too require an initial velocity to be defined somewhere. Furthermore, the `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py` and `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` files indicate that `time_derivative` is used for computing time derivatives, which might be a useful function to consider when implementing an automatic velocity calculation based on position derivatives.",
