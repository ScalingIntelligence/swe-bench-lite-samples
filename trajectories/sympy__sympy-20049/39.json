Specifically, the Point.vel() method is expected to calculate the velocity of a point relative to a specified reference frame. Based on the provided stack trace and the expected output, it seems like the method should be able to derive the velocity from the provided position vector. The relevant files identified include sympy/physics/vector/point.py and sympy/physics/vector/frame.py. Given that the exact method causing the error is `Q.vel(A)` in point.py, it is crucial to focus on this method and its dependencies to understand why the expected velocity calculation is not happening. A detailed review of the `vel` method and related methods like `set_vel`, `pos_from`, and potentially `express` or `time_derivative` from sympy/physics/vector/functions.py might be necessary to diagnose and fix the issue.",

It does not automatically calculate the velocity from the position vector.

To address the issue, we need to modify the `vel` method to use the position vector and the `time_derivative` function from sympy/physics/vector/functions.py to compute the velocity if it has not been explicitly set. The `time_derivative` function is capable of computing derivatives of expressions with respect to time, making it a suitable candidate for calculating the velocity from the position vector.

The user expects that if angular velocity can be calculated between two reference frames, then linear velocity should also be calculable for points in those frames. The current implementation of `Point.vel()` raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been explicitly set for the frame, unlike the angular velocity which can be automatically calculated. The search results confirm the existence of the `vel` method in the `Point` class with the described behavior. Additionally, the `time_derivative` function in `functions.py` could potentially be used to calculate the velocity if the method were to be updated to use it. The provided context and search results suggest that the relevant code spans are those in the `Point` class for velocity-related methods such as `set_vel` and `vel`. Existing methods like `v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory` already calculate velocity based on other frames and might serve as a basis for implementing the desired functionality. Given the alignment of the search results with the issue, it appears that the task of identifying relevant code spans is complete.",
