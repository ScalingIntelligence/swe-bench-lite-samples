These methods currently rely on manually setting velocities with 'set_vel' before they can be queried with 'vel'. To address the issue, we need to identify or implement a mechanism that automatically calculates velocities based on position changes, akin to how angular velocities are automatically derived from orientations. Given the current structure, methods like 'pos_from' and 'set_pos' might be leveraged to derive velocities indirectly. Additionally, looking into the 'v1pt_theory' and 'v2pt_theory' methods could provide insights into how velocities are calculated based on relative positions and angular velocities.",

Specifically, the user expects that if the position of a point is set with respect to another point in a reference frame, then the velocity of the point in that frame should be calculable, similar to how angular velocity is handled between reference frames. The provided `Q.vel(A)` example is expected to produce a result without raising an error. The current implementation raises a ValueError if the velocity has not been explicitly set for the frame, which is not the desired behavior. The presence of 'Point.vel' and 'Point.set_vel' methods in the current context and search results indicates that the issue is about the default behavior and error handling within these methods. The search results include all methods related to point velocity, including `Point.vel`, `Point.set_vel`, `Point.acc`, `Point.v1pt_theory`, and `Point.v2pt_theory`, which are relevant to the issue of calculating and setting velocities in different contexts. The search also includes 'Point.partial_velocity', which might be indirectly related to the issue but is not directly relevant to the error in question. Based on the provided context and search results, modifications to the 'Point.vel' method are likely necessary to meet the user's expectations by computing the velocity if it has not been explicitly set, possibly using mechanics principles or derivatives of positions.",

These methods could serve as a starting point for automating velocity calculations, as velocity can be derived from the time derivative of position. Additionally, 'v1pt_theory' and 'v2pt_theory' methods indicate how velocities can be calculated using relative positions and angular velocities, suggesting potential integration points for automatic calculation logic. Further, the 'vel' method currently relies on velocities being manually set with 'set_vel', indicating where automated calculations should interface.

The relevant code spans identified in the search results show methods related to the Point class in `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`. These methods include initializing the Point class, setting positions, setting velocities, and calculating velocities and accelerations. The critical method `Point.vel` is where the ValueError is raised due to the velocity not being defined in the specified reference frame. This method needs to be adjusted to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly defined, similar to how the angular velocity is calculated for reference frames. The other methods like `Point.__init__`, `Point.set_pos`, `Point.set_vel`, and `Point.pos_from` are also relevant as they provide the foundational setup for positions and velocities that `Point.vel` relies on. The issue suggests that the functionality should mimic how angular velocities are handled, indicating that these methods are crucial to understanding and implementing the solution. Therefore, the identified code spans are directly related to the reported issue and are necessary for implementing the desired functionality.",

These methods could serve as a starting point for automating velocity calculations, as velocity can be derived from the time derivative of position. Additionally, 'v1pt_theory' and 'v2pt_theory' methods indicate how velocities can be calculated using relative positions and angular velocities, suggesting potential integration points for automatic calculation logic. Further, the 'vel' method currently relies on velocities being manually set with 'set_vel', indicating where automated calculations should interface.

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
