The current implementation does not seem to handle the velocity calculation as expected, even though it can calculate angular velocity. The code provided demonstrates setting up frames and points, defining positions, but not velocities. The error occurs specifically when trying to retrieve the velocity ('Q.vel(A)'). This suggests a focus on the 'Point' class and its 'vel' method in the 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py' file. Additionally, other relevant methods such as 'set_pos' and 'set_vel' within the same class might be relevant. Also, the 'ReferenceFrame' class in 'sympy/physics/vector/frame.py' could be a source for understanding the orientation and potentially the velocity calculation implementation.",

The main issue is that the `Point.vel()` method raises a ValueError when attempting to calculate the velocity, which should instead return the derivative of the position vector. I then examined the search results to identify relevant code spans. The key methods to focus on are `Point.vel()` and `Point.set_vel()`. The `Point.vel()` method currently raises an error if the velocity has not been explicitly defined in the given reference frame, which aligns with the reported issue. Additionally, the `Point.set_vel()` method is used to set the velocity, but there is no mechanism in place to automatically calculate the velocity based on position vectors if not explicitly set. Therefore, the identified spans include `Point.__init__`, `Point.vel`, and `Point.set_vel`. I also considered other methods such as `Point.pos_from` which is related to the position handling, but it doesn't directly address the current issue unless we decide to implement a velocity calculation based on position changes.",
