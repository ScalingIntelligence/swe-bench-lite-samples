This behavior causes a `ValueError` which the user would like to avoid by implementing the automatic calculation of velocities similar to how angular velocities are handled. The key methods involved in the context include the `vel()`, `pos_from()`, `set_vel()`, and other related theory methods (like `v1pt_theory`, `v2pt_theory`) which could potentially be modified or leveraged to address this. The `time_derivative` function in `functions.py` might also be relevant for computing time derivatives of vectors and possibly aiding in the implementation of automatic velocity calculations.\n\nThe examination of the provided code spans suggests that while the current implementation strictly checks for the presence of a velocity in `self._vel_dict` and raises an error if not found, there's an opportunity to update the `vel()` method to compute the velocity based on the position defined, if not already stored. This enhancement could reference similar methodologies employed in other methods like `acc()` which attempt to compute the acceleration based on existing velocity data. Coupling this with the `time_derivative` function from `functions.py` to differentiate the position vector may offer a straightforward approach to automatically calculate velocities.\n\nThe identified code spans within `point.py` (especially `Point.vel`, `Point.pos_from`, `Point.set_vel`) and the `time_derivative` function in `functions.py` are directly pertinent to addressing the reported issue and should suffice for planning the implementation or modification towards enabling automatic velocity calculation from defined positions.",

This could be done by taking the time derivative of the position vector (if defined) similar to how the acceleration 'acc' method works when velocity is not explicitly set. Additionally, the 'time_derivative' function in 'functions.py' could be utilized for this purpose, as it is already equipped to handle derivatives of Vector objects with respect to time.",

The expected behavior is to calculate the velocity by differentiating the position vector with respect to time, similar to how angular velocity is handled. The provided code spans include methods related to position, velocity, and acceleration settings and calculations in the `Point` class. There are also methods for calculating velocity based on the positions and orientations of other points and frames. The relevant spans include `Point.__init__`, `Point.vel`, `Point.set_vel`, `Point.pos_from`, and `Point.set_pos`.
