The expected functionality should mimic the orientation and angular velocity calculations that are already implemented. Given the provided context, the relevant files include `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` and `sympy/physics/vector/frame.py`, but the velocity calculation logic is not fully implemented or accessible within the provided methods in `point.py`. The proposed solution involves improving the `vel` method in the `Point` class within `point.py` to calculate the velocity if possible, analogous to the existing angular velocity functionality in `frame.py`. Thus, the search should focus on the `Point` class methods for potential improvements and the `ReferenceFrame` class methods for angular velocity as a model.",

The user expects that if the orientation between two reference frames is specified and the angular velocity can be calculated, then the same should be possible for linear velocities. However, the current implementation raises a ValueError if the velocity of the point has not been defined in the specified ReferenceFrame. This indicates that the functionality to automatically calculate the velocity based on the positional information is not present.\n\nUpon examining the search results, the relevant code spans are found within the file 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py'. Specifically, we need to focus on the spans that define the 'Point.vel' method and potentially the 'Point.pos_from' and 'Point.set_pos' methods, which handle the positional information.\n\nThe 'Point.vel' method currently checks if the velocity is defined in the '_vel_dict' of the Point object. If not, it raises a ValueError. This confirms the issue reported. Furthermore, the 'Point.pos_from' method is likely relevant as it calculates the positional vector between two points, which should logically be used to compute the velocity if the method is to be implemented.\n\nGiven the code spans identified, it is clear that the current implementation does not automatically compute the velocity based on the positional data. This matches the reported issue, and suggests that implementing the calculation of velocity based on positional data would require either modifying or extending the existing 'Point.vel' method, potentially utilizing the 'Point.pos_from' and other relevant methods.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the 'ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in' method in 'sympy/physics/vector/frame.py' correctly calculates angular velocities based on specified orientations, which demonstrates the expectation set by the reported issue.",
