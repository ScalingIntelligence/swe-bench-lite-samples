The provided code spans from `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` include the `Point` class and its methods, such as `vel()`, `set_vel()`, `pos_from()`, and others. These methods are relevant because they directly deal with the position and velocity computations that the issue is focused on. The `vel()` method currently raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been explicitly defined for a given frame, which aligns with the reported problem. The solution would likely involve modifying the `vel()` method to automatically compute the velocity based on the position and its derivatives if it hasn't been explicitly set, similar to the way angular velocity is handled. Additionally, the `set_pos()` and `pos_from()` methods are relevant for understanding how positions are managed and could be leveraged to compute velocities.

The expected behavior is for `Q.vel(A)` to compute the linear velocity based on the derivatives of the position vector 'r' with respect to the reference frame 'A'. The current implementation in the `Point.vel` method raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been previously defined in the specified reference frame. The solution would likely involve modifying the `Point.vel` method to automatically compute the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set, especially if the position has been defined. This aligns with the expected result shown, where the derivative of the position vector ('r.dt(A)') is used to compute the velocity.

For instance, the `acc` method computes acceleration from the velocity if it isn't explicitly set, which is similar to what we want to achieve with `vel`. Additionally, checking how `Frame` class handles automatic computation for angular velocities (`ang_vel_in`) could provide insights. This approach seems consistent given that both linear and angular motions are related through the rotation of frames.",

The provided file context and search results show that the `Point` class has methods for setting and getting position, velocity, and acceleration, but the `vel` method does not perform the calculation of velocity directly from the position vector. The `time_derivative` function in `functions.py` is relevant for performing time derivatives, which is necessary for calculating velocity. The `ReferenceFrame` class has methods for angular velocity, which are relevant for the related calculations of angular velocity between frames.

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
