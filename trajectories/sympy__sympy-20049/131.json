The issue specifically points out that the `vel` method in the `Point` class raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been explicitly set, even if positional data is available. We should ideally be able to compute the velocity based on the derivatives of positional data, similar to how angular velocities are handled in the `ReferenceFrame` class. The `Point` class defines various methods related to position, velocity, and acceleration, such as `set_pos`, `pos_from`, `set_vel`, and `vel`. The `ReferenceFrame` class has methods for angular velocities and accelerations like `ang_vel_in` and `ang_acc_in`. Relevant code spans involve the initialization and methods of the `Point` and `ReferenceFrame` classes, particularly where velocities are handled or could be derived from existing data. The analysis shows that no previous relevant code spans have been identified, so the focus should be on identifying all pertinent methods within both classes.",

Specifically, the `vel` method which raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been set in the specified reference frame, and the `set_vel` method which sets the velocity of the point. These parts of the code are crucial for addressing the issue by understanding the current behavior and potentially modifying it to automatically calculate the velocity if it hasn't been set, similar to how the angular velocity is handled.
