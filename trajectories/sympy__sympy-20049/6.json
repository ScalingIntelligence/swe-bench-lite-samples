The user expects that specifying the orientation of two reference frames should allow for the calculation of the velocity between the two points in those frames, similar to how angular velocity is calculated. However, the current implementation raises a ValueError if the velocity has not been previously defined in the specified ReferenceFrame. The search results include the 'vel' method and other related methods in the 'Point' class, such as 'set_vel', 'v1pt_theory', and 'v2pt_theory', which are used to set and calculate velocities in different scenarios. These methods are crucial for understanding how velocities are managed and could potentially be modified to address the reported issue. The 'vel' method directly addresses the reported issue by handling the retrieval of a point's velocity in a specific frame, but it currently lacks the capability to calculate the velocity if it has not been explicitly set. This functionality should be expanded to include automatic calculation based on the position and orientation information available.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
