The user expects the `vel` method of the `Point` class to calculate the velocity similarly to how the angular velocity is calculated in the `ReferenceFrame` class. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` because the velocity has not been defined. This suggests that either the method lacks the necessary logic to compute the velocity or the user needs to define the velocity manually before calling the method. To resolve this, we need to locate the `vel` method in the `Point` class and possibly the related methods that interact with it.",

The issue specifically mentions that the velocity calculation for a point in a given reference frame is not working as expected, and throws a ValueError. The relevant code spans in the search results include the `Point.vel` method, which is responsible for retrieving the velocity of a point in a specific frame. This method checks if the frame is in the `_vel_dict` (a dictionary storing velocity information) and raises a ValueError if not. Since the issue is about implementing or fixing the velocity calculation, the relevant code spans include `Point.vel`, `Point.set_vel`, and possibly `Point.pos_from` which is used in positioning the points and could be relevant in understanding or implementing velocity calculations. These spans will be used to try to understand why the velocity is not being calculated and to potentially implement a fix or new functionality.",
