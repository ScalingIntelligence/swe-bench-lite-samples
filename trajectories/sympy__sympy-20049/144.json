The provided code spans include methods associated with the Point class that manage positions, velocities, and accelerations. Specifically, the 'Point.vel' method raises a ValueError if the velocity has not been defined in the specified reference frame. This is clearly the method where the issue lies as per the error traceback in the reported issue. To address the issue, we need to extend the functionality of the 'Point.vel' method to compute the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set. The 'Point.pos_from' method could be used to get the relative position vector. By differentiating this position vector with respect to time (in the appropriate frame), we can compute the velocity. Thus, the 'Point.vel' method in the search results is highly relevant to solving this issue, and possibly integrating it with the 'Point.pos_from' method could implement the needed functionality.",
