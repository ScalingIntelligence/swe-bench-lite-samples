The current implementation raises a ValueError when trying to calculate the velocity of point Q in reference frame A. This suggests that the velocity has not been explicitly defined for the point in the frame. The goal is to implement or adjust the `vel` method in the `Point` class so that it can calculate the velocity if possible, similar to how angular velocity is handled in the `ReferenceFrame` class. The relevant methods to check and possibly modify would be `vel`, `set_vel`, and possibly `pos_from` and `set_pos` in the `Point` class.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
