The velocity calculation should behave similarly to the angular velocity calculation, which works as expected. The expected result of `Q.vel(A)` is the time derivative of the position vector `r` in frame `A`. The relevant file to investigate is `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` where the `Point` class is defined, particularly the `vel` method. From the provided context, it seems that the velocity has not been defined in the ReferenceFrame `A`, leading to the ValueError. Additionally, we should check the methods related to setting and calculating velocities in the `Point` class to ensure they are correctly implemented.",

I analyzed the search results to find the relevant code spans for `Point` class and its `vel` method. The first file `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` contains the `Point` class definition and the `vel` method is present there. This file also includes other methods related to velocity calculation and position setting which are likely relevant to the reported issue. The second file `sympy/vector/point.py` also contains a `Point` class but it does not include the `vel` method or any related functionality to calculate velocities as described in the issue. The third file `sympy/geometry/point.py` contains a `Point` class as well but it is not related to the physics or vector calculations described in the issue.

The current context already identifies relevant sections in the `point.py` file, including the `Point` class and its methods such as `__init__`, `vel`, `set_vel`, and others related to velocity and acceleration. The new search results from `frame.py` provide additional context, including the `ReferenceFrame` class and methods like `ang_vel_in` and `set_ang_vel`, which manage angular velocities between frames. The goal is to ensure that the velocity calculation logic in the `Point` class aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue, possibly by adapting or extending the current velocity methods.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
