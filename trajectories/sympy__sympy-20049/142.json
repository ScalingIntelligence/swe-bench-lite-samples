This method can be used to implement the desired functionality for `Point.vel()`. The `Dyadic.dt()` method in `dyadic.py` is also relevant because it calculates the time derivative of the dyadic in a specified frame, which might be applicable if the position vector were expressed in dyadic form.

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
