The method currently raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been explicitly set, which doesn't align with the intuitive behavior observed in `ang_vel_in`. The search results distinctly present the `Point` class and its methods along with the `time_derivative` function from `sympy.physics.vector.functions`, instrumental in calculating derivatives, possibly applicable to velocity. The `Point` class includes methods related to velocity (`vel`, `set_vel`, `v1pt_theory`, and `v2pt_theory`), position (`pos_from`, `set_pos`), and acceleration but lacks automatic calculation for velocity similar to angular velocity. Considering the issue, the key spans of code to review and potentially enhance include the `vel` method and the propagation of velocities through methods like `v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory`. The `time_derivative` function can offer insights into how derivatives are computed and apply these insights to calculate velocity. Thus, the identified spans are crucial for addressing the automated calculation of velocity in the `Point` class.",
