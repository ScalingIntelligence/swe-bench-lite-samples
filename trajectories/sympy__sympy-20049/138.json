This is in contrast to the angular velocity, which is calculated without issues. The expected behavior is for `Q.vel(A)` to calculate the velocity based on the defined position and the time derivative of the position vector. \n\nThe search results include the `Point` class definition from `sympy.physics.vector.point.py` and the `time_derivative` function from `sympy.physics.vector.functions.py`. The `Point.vel` method specifically checks if the velocity dictionary for the frame exists, and if not, it raises a `ValueError`. This matches the issue description. Additionally, the `time_derivative` function is relevant because it calculates the time derivative of a vector, which is essentially what is needed to calculate the velocity. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and should be considered for further analysis or modification to fix the issue.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified are:\n1. `Point.__init__`: Initializes the velocity dictionary.\n2. `Point.vel`: The method that raises the ValueError when the velocity is not defined.\n3. `time_derivative`: Function to calculate the time derivative of a vector expression, which can potentially be used to implement missing velocity calculations.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
