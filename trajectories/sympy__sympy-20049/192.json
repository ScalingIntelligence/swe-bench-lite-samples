These methods include `Point.set_vel()`, `Point.v1pt_theory()`, and `Point.v2pt_theory()`. The current implementation of `Point.vel()` specifically raises the error that was reported in the issue, indicating that either these internal data structures need to be updated or a new algorithm needs to be implemented to calculate the velocity on the fly when it has not been explicitly set.

The expected behavior is for the method to automatically calculate the velocity based on the position derivative if the velocity is not already set. The provided search results contain the `Point` class definition, including the problematic `vel` method and related methods like `set_vel`, `pos_from`, and `set_pos`. These methods are relevant because they deal with setting and retrieving velocities and positions of points. The task is to identify the relevant code spans that need to be modified or studied to implement the expected functionality where `vel` automatically calculates the velocity if not explicitly set. The identified relevant spans include the `Point.__init__`, `Point.vel`, `Point.set_vel`, `Point.pos_from`, and `Point.set_pos`. Additionally, the `Point.acc` method's calculation of acceleration based on velocity derivative provides a useful precedent for modifying `Point.vel`.",
