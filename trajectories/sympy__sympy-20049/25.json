The issue is that when trying to calculate the velocity of a point in a given reference frame, a `ValueError` is raised if the velocity has not been defined in that frame. The expected behavior is that the velocity should be calculated based on the position vector's time derivative. The relevant code spans can be found in the `Point` class within `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`. In particular, the `Point.vel()` method is the one responsible for calculating the velocity, and it currently raises a `ValueError` if the velocity is not defined for the requested frame. Additionally, the `time_derivative` function in `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` is relevant because it computes time derivatives of expressions, potentially including position vectors, which could be used to calculate velocity if the position is known. The identified code spans include the `Point.__init__`, `Point.vel`, `Point.set_vel`, and `Point.pos_from` methods in the `Point` class, as well as the `time_derivative` function in the `functions` module. These spans help understand the current state of velocity calculation and indicate potential areas for modification to implement the expected behavior.",
