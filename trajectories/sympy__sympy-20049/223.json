The current implementation raises a ValueError when trying to calculate the velocity of a point in a reference frame where it hasn't been explicitly defined. The expectation is that the velocity should be calculable, similar to how angular velocity is calculated between two reference frames. The key part of the reported issue seems to be centered around the Point.vel method in the point.py file. This method currently checks if the velocity has been defined in the given reference frame and raises an error if not. There is no fallback mechanism to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been set. This behavior is inconsistent with the functionality for angular velocities, where the calculation is possible even if not explicitly set. Upon examining the code segments, the Point class and its methods are of particular interest. Specifically, Point.vel is the method that needs to be modified to incorporate the desired functionality. Other related methods within the Point class, such as Point.set_vel, Point.v1pt_theory, and Point.v2pt_theory, also provide context for how velocities are typically handled or could potentially be used to implement the new functionality. No specific code in the frame.py file seems directly related to this issue, as it primarily deals with ReferenceFrames and their angular velocities, which are not the focus of this issue.",

The `acc` method calculates the acceleration if it hasn't been explicitly provided by taking the time derivative of the velocity. We need to adapt this approach for the `vel` method, where if the velocity is not set, it should calculate the velocity based on the position's time derivative. This involves leveraging the `pos_from` method to get the position vector and then taking its derivative with respect to time in the given frame.",
