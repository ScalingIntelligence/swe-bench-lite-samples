The current implementation of the `vel` method in the `Point` class raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been explicitly defined for the reference frame. The expected behavior is that the velocity should be calculated based on the position vector's derivative with respect to the reference frame, similar to how angular velocity is handled. This suggests that the relevant code spans should include the `vel` method and possibly the `set_vel` method, as well as any related methods or checks for defining velocities. By examining the `vel` method and its context, we can determine if the implementation can be adapted to automatically calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the velocity calculation aligns with the physics and mathematics of the system, particularly in relation to the reference frames and their orientations.",
