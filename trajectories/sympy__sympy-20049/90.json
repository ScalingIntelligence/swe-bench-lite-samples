The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when trying to calculate the velocity of a point in a reference frame if it has not been previously defined. The expected behavior is for the velocity to be automatically calculated (or derived) based on the position and orientation of points and frames, similar to how angular velocity is handled. The search should focus on the `Point` class methods, especially `vel` and any related methods that might be responsible for defining or calculating velocities.",

The expected behavior is to calculate the velocity based on the position vector's derivative. The search results primarily focus on two main files: 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py' and 'sympy/physics/vector/frame.py'. In 'point.py', the relevant code spans include the 'Point' class definition, particularly the 'vel' method which is currently raising the error. Additionally, the 'set_vel' method, which defines the velocity, and the 'pos_from' method, which calculates the position vector from another point, are also relevant. These methods are crucial for potentially implementing the desired velocity calculation. The 'frame.py' file also contains relevant code spans, particularly the 'ReferenceFrame' class and its methods dealing with angular velocity and orientation, which are indirectly related to the velocity calculation since the issue mentions comparing orientation and position calculations. Therefore, these code spans provide a foundational context for understanding the relevant parts of the codebase needed to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
