The search results focus on the Point class within the 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py' file. Here, we can see the methods related to points and their velocities and accelerations, including the current implementation of Point.vel(). This method checks if the velocity is already defined in the provided frame. If not, it raises a ValueError. The expected behavior mentioned in the issue is to calculate the velocity if possible, which suggests that the method should attempt to calculate the velocity even if it hasn't been explicitly defined for the given frame. This current implementation aligns with the issue described, making the identified spans relevant to address the bug or enhancement described.
