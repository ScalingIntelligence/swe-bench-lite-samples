According to the issue, when attempting to calculate the velocity of a point in a specific reference frame, a `ValueError` is raised stating that the velocity has not been defined in that reference frame. The expected behavior, as demonstrated by manually calculating the derivative of the position vector, suggests that the velocity should be calculable if the position is known and rotational dynamics are involved, akin to the functionality for angular velocity. The code spans provided in the search results include the `Point` class definition and its methods, particularly relevant is the `Point.vel()` method which directly relates to the issue. Additionally, methods like `Point.pos_from()` and `Point.set_pos()` are relevant as they deal with position vectors, which are prerequisites for calculating velocity. The `Point.v1pt_theory()` and `Point.v2pt_theory()` methods also pertain to velocity derivations based on points and frames, indicating that velocity calculations are indeed involved within the class but the specific issue needs to be addressed to ensure that velocities are correctly computed and do not result in errors. Thus, these spans cover the necessary components identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
