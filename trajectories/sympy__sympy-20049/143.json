The user expects that the method would automatically calculate the velocity similar to how angular velocity is handled in the ReferenceFrame class. The search results provide two main relevant files: 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py' and 'sympy/physics/vector/frame.py'. In 'point.py', the `vel` method is found (span_id='Point.vel'), which is the method in question. This method will need to be modified to automatically derive the velocity based on the positions set (like using `r.dt(A)` for the derivative). 'frame.py' provides a useful context for understanding how angular velocities are handled and how they might influence the velocity calculations in the Point class. Specifically, the `ang_vel_in` method (span_id='ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in') might serve as a model for the implementation logic needed in the Point class's `vel` method. Additionally, there is a `_w_diff_dcm` method (span_id='ReferenceFrame._w_diff_dcm'), which may be indirectly relevant for potential algorithms connected to derivative calculations needed in `vel`.",

  "initial_message": "Point.vel() should calculate the velocity if possible\nIf you specify the orientation of two reference frames and then ask for the angular velocity between the two reference frames the angular velocity will be calculated. But if you try to do the same thing with velocities, this doesn't work.

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
