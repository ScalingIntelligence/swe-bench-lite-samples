It seems that the Point class in sympy/physics/vector/point.py is the primary area of interest as it contains the 'vel' method mentioned in the error message. Additionally, the ReferenceFrame class in sympy/physics/vector/frame.py interacts closely with points and their velocities. Lastly, functions.py might also be relevant for the general kinematic equations and time derivatives related to velocities. Therefore, focusing on these classes and methods should help in identifying and potentially fixing the issue.",

The issue specifically points out a problem in calculating the velocity of a point when referenced in a certain frame. This suggests that the 'vel' method in the Point class, as well as any methods that interact directly with or depend on 'vel', are critical. Additionally, since the issue is about the behavior of velocity calculations vis-\u00e0-vis reference frames, methods in the ReferenceFrame class that deal with velocity or frame transformations should also be scrutinized, such as 'ang_vel_in' and 'set_ang_vel'. The search results provide a comprehensive view of these methods and their implementations. Notably, the 'vel' method handles the direct computation of velocity for a point in a specified frame, which directly aligns with the problem described in the issue. Furthermore, the 'set_vel' method manages the assignment of velocities, which could be involved if new functionality is needed to resolve the reported issue. These methods in the Point class are particularly relevant as they directly pertain to the core functionality that is deficient as described in the issue. Thus, they should be carefully reviewed to determine if they can be adapted or if new code needs to be introduced to resolve the issue.",
