This method currently raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been previously defined in the specified reference frame. The expected behavior is for the method to calculate the velocity if possible, similar to how angular velocity is calculated between reference frames. The relevant files to investigate are `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` and possibly `sympy/physics/vector/frame.py` for the `ReferenceFrame` class. The `vel` method in the `Point` class and its interaction with reference frames are of particular interest.",

The expected behavior is for the velocity to be calculated as the time derivative of the position vector. Given this, the relevant parts of the codebase to focus on are those related to the Point class and its methods for dealing with velocity. Specifically, the `Point.vel` method is of primary interest, as it currently checks if the velocity has been defined in the specified frame and raises an error if not. Additionally, the `Point.set_vel` and `Point.v1pt_theory` methods are relevant as they deal with setting and calculating velocity. The `ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in` method is also relevant as it calculates angular velocity and could be used as a model for calculating linear velocity. Based on these observations, the identified spans from `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` are: `Point.vel`, `Point.set_vel`, `Point.v1pt_theory`, and `Point.acc` (since it handles acceleration and could provide insights into how velocity might be handled).",

The user is expecting `Point.vel()` to calculate the velocity if possible, similar to how `ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in()` calculates angular velocity. Currently, `Point.vel()` raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been defined, which is the problem the user is encountering. The user wants to know why this isn't implemented and suggests that it should be because it's confusing why it works for orientations but not positions. The current file context shows the implementation of `Point.vel()` and related methods in `point.py`, which consistently checks if the velocity has been defined and raises a `ValueError` if not. The search results include additional context from `frame.py` related to `ReferenceFrame` operations, which are not directly relevant to the issue at hand since the problem is centered around the `Point` class and its methods, specifically `vel()`. Given the existing context and search results, the solution to the reported issue will likely involve modifying the `vel()` method in the `Point` class to calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly defined, mimicking the behavior of `ang_vel_in()` in the `ReferenceFrame` class. This requires identifying relevant code spans in `point.py` that manage velocity calculations and modifications necessary to include automatic velocity calculation. In the context of the provided files and spans, the relevant code spans are those directly involved in velocity handling in the `Point` class.",
