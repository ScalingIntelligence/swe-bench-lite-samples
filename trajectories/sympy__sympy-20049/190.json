The user expects the `vel` method to calculate and return the velocity of a point when given a reference frame, similar to how the angular velocity is calculated between reference frames. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been previously defined for the specified reference frame. The search results include the `Point` class and its methods, which are relevant to the issue. Specifically, the `vel` method, along with the `set_vel`, `pos_from`, and `set_pos` methods are key to addressing the user's request. These methods interact directly with the position and velocity calculations and definitions within the class. Additionally, the `v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory` methods provide theoretical frameworks for calculating velocities based on other points and frames, which could potentially be leveraged to implement the desired functionality. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue and could be the basis for implementing the desired velocity calculation functionality.",
