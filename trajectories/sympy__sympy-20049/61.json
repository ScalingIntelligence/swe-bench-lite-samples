The user expects that the velocity should be calculated based on the position and orientation of the reference frames, similar to how the angular velocity is calculated. The relevant code spans are identified in the `Point` class, specifically the `vel` method where the error is raised, the `set_vel` method for defining velocities, and potentially the `pos_from` method which deals with position calculations. Additionally, the `time_derivative` function in `functions.py` might be relevant for calculating derivatives which could be used to compute velocities. The search for relevant code spans appears to be complete as the identified spans address the core functionality mentioned in the issue.",

The expected result involves calculating the derivative of the position vector with respect to time. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been previously set. To address this, we need to enhance the `vel` method in the `Point` class to handle the case where the velocity is not set but can be derived from the position. The search results provide relevant code spans, especially in the `Point` class and the `time_derivative` function in `functions.py`, which seem to be directly related to the reported issue. Specifically, the `Point.vel` method in the `Point` class needs to be updated to compute the velocity from the position if it hasn't been set directly. This can be done by using the `time_derivative` function that exists in the `functions.py` file. The `Point.pos_from` method can provide the positional vector required for the derivative computation.",

Although the immediate issue of the missing velocity calculation directly in `Q.vel(A)` isn't directly solved in the current context, understanding how velocities are set using `set_vel` and how time derivatives are computed with `time_derivative` is evident.

The issue demonstrates that while angular velocity is correctly computed, calculating linear velocity for a point in a specified frame raises a ValueError. This suggests a need to improve or extend the functionality to handle velocity calculations for points in a way similar to angular velocity computations. The file 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py' contains the implementation of the Point class with methods related to position, velocity, and acceleration. The 'vel' method in this class is where the reported ValueError occurs. The 'time_derivative' function in 'sympy/physics/vector/functions.py' is also relevant as it computes time derivatives of expressions, which is directly related to computing velocities. The new search results confirm the presence of these methods and also introduce the 'dynamicsymbols' function which generates time-differentiable symbols, relevant because velocities are often expressed in terms of such time derivatives. Based on these findings, the existing code in 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py' and 'sympy/physics/vector/functions.py' should be sufficient to address the reported issue by enhancing the 'vel' method or adding new functionality for handling velocity calculations for points.",
