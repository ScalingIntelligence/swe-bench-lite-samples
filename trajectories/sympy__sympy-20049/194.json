The expected behavior is that if a point's position is defined with respect to another point and the relative position vector changes over time, the velocity should be derivable from this position vector. The search results contain several relevant code spans in the `Point` class within the `sympy/physics/vector/point.py` file, including the `Point.__init__`, `Point.vel`, `Point.set_vel`, and `Point.pos_from` methods. These spans are directly related to the initialization and management of positions, velocities, and accelerations of points, which are critical for implementing the desired functionality. The `Point.vel` method specifically raises a `ValueError` when the velocity has not been defined, which matches the problem described in the issue. Therefore, these spans are likely to be the starting points for addressing the issue by implementing a method to automatically calculate the velocity from the position if it has not been explicitly set.",

To address the issue of automatically calculating velocities based on known positions or dynamics equations, one might explore further into the `v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory` methods or look into how position derivatives are handled in the module.

This is evident from the error that occurs when trying to calculate the velocity of point `Q` in ReferenceFrame `A`, which results in a `ValueError` claiming the velocity has not been defined. This aligns with the current context provided, which includes the `Point` class definition in 'sympy/physics/vector/point.py', particularly the `vel` method within this class. The issue is also evident in the new search results, where the `vel` method raises the same ValueError when the velocity is not found in the `_vel_dict` dictionary. This confirms that the error is directly linked to how velocities are currently stored and retrieved in the `Point` class. Beyond this, there are no additional code spans in the search results that directly address the issue of velocity calculation. Therefore, implementing a solution to automatically set the velocity using positional data when it is not explicitly defined in the `_vel_dict` should resolve this issue.",

However, the actual calculation of velocity from a known position (using position derivatives) is not directly handled by these methods. The `vel` method, which is the subject of the issue, raises an error if the velocity has not been explicitly set for the given frame. To address this, one might consider extending the `vel` method to automatically calculate the velocity from the position vector for frames where the velocity hasn't been explicitly set. This could involve taking the time derivative of the position vector or using more sophisticated methods as implied by `v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory` if applicable. Additionally, exploring methods in related modules like `sympy.physics.mechanics` that deal with dynamics equations or automatic differentiation could reveal other potential solutions or patterns to incorporate.",

Key methods in the `Point` class like `a1pt_theory`, `a2pt_theory`, `v1pt_theory`, and `v2pt_theory` provide mechanisms for calculating accelerations and velocities based on various theories and relative frames. However, the actual calculation of velocity from a known position (using position derivatives) is not directly handled by these methods. The `vel` method, which is the subject of the issue, raises an error if the velocity has not been explicitly set for the given frame. To address this, one might consider extending the `vel` method to automatically calculate the velocity from the position vector for frames where the velocity hasn't been explicitly set. This could involve taking the time derivative of the position vector or using more sophisticated methods as implied by `v1pt_theory` and `v2pt_theory` if applicable. Additionally, exploring methods in related modules like `sympy.physics.mechanics` that deal with dynamics equations or automatic differentiation could reveal other potential solutions or patterns to incorporate.",
