The key elements from the issue include the methods `Point.vel()` and `Point.set_vel()`, which are responsible for calculating and setting the velocity of a point in a given reference frame. The issue suggests that the current implementation raises a `ValueError` if the velocity hasn't been explicitly set, which should be improved to automatically calculate the velocity if possible, similar to how angular velocities are handled. The `Point.vel()` method directly relates to the reported problem as it is where the 'Velocity of point ... has not been defined' error occurs. The logical next step would be to modify this method to include automatic velocity calculation logic. Additionally, the `time_derivative` function in `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` is relevant because it computes the time derivative of expressions, which is needed for the velocity calculation. This function could be utilized within the `Point.vel()` method to automatically calculate the velocity based on other kinematic parameters if it hasn't been explicitly set.",

Other relevant methods like set_vel(), v1pt_theory(), and v2pt_theory() are also found in the Point class, which suggests this class is the main area for modifications to implement the functionality described in the issue. Additionally, the time_derivative function in the sympy/physics/vector/functions.py file may assist in calculating velocities if used appropriately in the Point class methods.
