The specific problem is that the `vel` method of the Point class fails to compute the velocity when the point's position is set with respect to another point. The expected behavior should mimic the angular velocity calculation, where the derivative of the position vector with respect to time is computed. Since the error occurs within the `Point.vel` method, that should be the primary focus for investigation and potential modification. The relevant classes and methods include Point, ReferenceFrame, and the `vel` method within the Point class.",

The search results provide relevant code from the Point class in sympy/physics/vector/point.py, including methods like `vel`, `set_vel`, `pos_from`, and others that are crucial for understanding and potentially implementing the required functionality for calculating velocity. The `vel` method directly relates to the issue because it currently checks if the velocity is defined in the specified frame and raises a ValueError if not. The solution might involve modifying this method or adding a new method to calculate the velocity based on the position, similar to how angular velocity is calculated. Relevant code spans include the entire class definition (`Point`), the `vel` method (`Point.vel`), and the `set_vel` method (`Point.set_vel`), as well as the `pos_from` method (`Point.pos_from`), which is necessary for determining the position vector between two points.

The current context already identifies relevant code spans in `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`, particularly focusing on the `Point.vel` method and related functionalities. The new search results in `sympy/physics/vector/frame.py` provide additional context on the `ReferenceFrame` class and its methods, including `ang_vel_in` and `set_ang_vel`, which are relevant to understanding how velocities are currently handled. These results do not directly address the issue but deepen the understanding of related mechanics in the codebase.
