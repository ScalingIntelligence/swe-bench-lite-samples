The current implementation raises a ValueError if the velocity has not been explicitly defined. The goal is to enhance the method to automatically calculate the velocity based on the position and orientation of reference frames, similar to how angular velocities are handled. Given the existing context, the search should focus on the Point class within the sympy.physics.vector module, specifically the vel method. Additionally, the ReferenceFrame class and its related methods in the same module should be reviewed to understand how orientations are handled, potentially guiding the implementation of velocity calculations.",

Specifically, the user has demonstrated that the angular velocity calculation works between two reference frames, but the linear velocity does not, resulting in a ValueError. To address this, we need to look at the `Point` class in `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`, focusing on the `vel` method. This method currently raises a ValueError if the velocity has not been defined in the specified reference frame. The expected solution is to derive the velocity from the positional vector's derivative with respect to the reference frame. The provided search results include relevant code spans within the `Point` class, such as the `vel`, `pos_from`, and `set_vel` methods. Additionally, the `ReferenceFrame` class is included, which is relevant for understanding the orientation and angular velocity, but the main focus should be on the `Point` class and its methods for position and velocity calculations.",

Maybe there is a reason it isn't implemented. But we should try to implement it because it is confusing why this works for orientations and not positions.\r\n\r\n\n"
