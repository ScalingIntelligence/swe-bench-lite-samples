The provided search results contain the `Point` class definition from `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`. Specifically, the `vel` method in the `Point` class raises a `ValueError` if the velocity has not been defined for the specified reference frame. To address the issue, we need to implement a way to automatically calculate the velocity if it hasn't been explicitly set. This is evidenced by the need to compute velocity similar to how angular velocity is computed in the `ang_vel_in` method of the `ReferenceFrame` class. The relevant code spans include the `set_vel`, `vel`, and potentially the `pos_from` methods, as they deal with setting and getting velocities and positions respectively, which are crucial for calculating velocities. The `Point.vel` method's error handling is directly related to the issue, and modifications in this method could potentially resolve the reported problem.",
