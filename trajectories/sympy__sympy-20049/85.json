From the provided context in `Point` class, it is evident that the `vel` method raises an error if the velocity has not been explicitly set for the point in the given reference frame. This behavior is different from the calculation of angular velocities, which are automatically derived based on the orientation of the frames. In the search results, the `time_derivative` function in `sympy/physics/vector/functions.py` is likely relevant because it computes time derivatives of expressions, including vectors, which aligns with the need to calculate velocity from position. Additionally, the `express` function could be useful for expressing vectors (like position) in a different frame, potentially aiding in the computation of velocity in the desired reference frame.
