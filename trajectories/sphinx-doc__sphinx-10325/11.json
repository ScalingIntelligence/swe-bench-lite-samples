Analysis of the provided code reveals that the current implementation of the :inherited-members: option is handled in the 'inherited_members_option' function, which converts a single class name into a string if provided. However, it does not currently support lists of classes for filtering. Additionally, the 'Documenter.filter_members' method is responsible for filtering members based on various options, including 'inherited_members'. This method iterates through the members of a class and applies filters including checking if a member is from a specified inherited class. To support the new feature, modifications will be needed in the 'inherited_members_option' function to handle lists of classes and adjustments in the 'Documenter.filter_members' method to apply the filtering logic for multiple classes. Relevant spans include 'inherited_members_option', 'Documenter.filter_members', 'Documenter' class, and the utility functions 'bool_option' and 'exclude_members_option' which interact with member filtering options.",

Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
