The key methods to analyze are `get_object_members` in both classes. In `ModuleDocumenter`, the method currently processes lists of module members and determines which are to be documented or skipped. This is relevant as it shows how members are selectively documented based on options. In `ClassDocumenter`, the `get_object_members` method also processes members but focuses on class members, including inherited ones. This method is particularly relevant as it directly handles inherited members based on the `inherited_members` option. To support more than one class for this option, modifications would likely involve enhancing the handling of the `inherited_members` option in both `ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter` to accept a list of classes and selectively ignore those when documenting inherited members. Given the provided code, focusing on these classes and methods would be the starting point for implementing the requested feature.",

Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
