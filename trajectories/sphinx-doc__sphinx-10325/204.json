The `get_object_members` and `filter_members` methods are critical for determining which members (including inherited ones) are to be documented. To extend the functionality to ignore specific base classes, modifications would likely involve enhancing the `inherited_members_option` to accept and process a list of classes, and then integrating the handling of this list within the `get_object_members` and `filter_members` methods to ensure that members from disregarded classes are not included. Additionally, other configuration settings and event hooks such as 'autodoc-skip-member' might need to be considered to fully integrate this feature. Further investigation is recommended in the `Documenter` base class and its interactions to ensure all necessary parts of the system are aware of and can handle the new :inherited-members: list option.",

Additionally, other configuration settings and event hooks such as 'autodoc-skip-member' might need to be considered to fully integrate this feature.

However, upon reconsidering the task with the provided feedback, it is evident that the task requires focusing on the specific changes needed in the method 'filter_members'. The relevant lines for modification primarily concern the handling of inherited members, specifically around the logic that checks for inherited members and how they are processed based on options provided.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
