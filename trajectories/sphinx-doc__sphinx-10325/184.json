The current implementation of 'get_object_members' and 'filter_members' methods in the 'Documenter' class does not support specifying multiple classes for inheritance control. The code spans 'Documenter.get_object_members', 'Documenter.filter_members', 'ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members', and 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members' are relevant because they handle the retrieval and filtering of object members, which includes inherited members. These methods need to be updated to handle the new functionality of ignoring specified base classes.

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
