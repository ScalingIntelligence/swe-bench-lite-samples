The current implementation of `Documenter.filter_members` and related methods in `ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter` can be leveraged, but they need to be updated to handle a list of inherited members. Specifically, we need to modify the `is_filtered_inherited_member` function in `Documenter.filter_members` to iterate over a list of classes to determine if a member should be filtered out. We also need to update the `inherited_members_option` in `ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter` to accept and process a list of class names. The relevant spans to focus on are `Documenter.filter_members`, `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`, and `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` as they currently handle the logic for filtering and processing inherited members. Additionally, we should look into how options are specified and processed in these classes, focusing on `ModuleDocumenter.option_spec` and `ClassDocumenter.option_spec`.",

The logic within the `filter_members` method has been refined to ensure that members inherited from specified base classes are correctly identified and handled based on whether they should be ignored or included. The method now iterates over a list of inherited members if provided and applies the appropriate checks for each class in the list. Additionally, the logic in `Documenter.get_object_members` has been adjusted to ensure consistency in handling the `inherited_members` option across all relevant methods. Given that the changes have been applied correctly and the requirements are met, we can conclude that the issue has been fully addressed.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
