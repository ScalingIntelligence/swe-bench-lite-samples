There may be a need to adjust how inherited members are treated here as well.\n\nGiven that the current implementation is likely to change, the best course of action is to identify the key methods in the `Documenter` and `ClassDocumenter` classes related to inherited members and prepare for modifying or extending them to accommodate the new feature request.",

In the provided file context and search results from 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py', the relevant sections to be modified are related to the handling of inherited members and the option specifications for ClassDocumenter. Specifically, 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members' and the '__init__' method where options are set up. These methods control how inherited members are fetched and filtered. The current implementation evaluates inherited members, but it does not handle a list of classes for selective inheritance as the user requests. To implement the feature, I identified the parts of code where modifications would be needed to accept and process a list of classes as an argument under the :inherited-members: option, then apply this list to filter out unwanted base class members while retaining or documenting desired ones.",

I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
