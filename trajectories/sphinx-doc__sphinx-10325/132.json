The 'ModuleDocumenter' class already has methods to handle members based on user-defined options, which aligns with the desired functionality.

This requires modifications around the handling of the 'inherited-members' option in the 'ModuleDocumenter' and 'ClassDocumenter' classes. The search results show relevant code spans in 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' that handle options including 'inherited-members' and how members are processed. Specifically, 'ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members' and 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members' methods process members and would need adjustment to implement the new functionality. The 'inherited_members_option' function and 'merge_members_option' function are also relevant as they manipulate the 'inherited-members' option. These identified spans should help in implementing the feature request.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
