From the search results, several code spans are relevant to this issue.\n\n1. **Class Documenter and Module Documenter**: These classes handle the documentation of classes and modules respectively. The `document_members` method in both classes is crucial as it orchestrates the documentation of members, which is central to the issue.\n\n2. **Documenter.get_object_members**: This method fetches the members of the object being documented, which is directly related to the inherited members functionality. The method needs to be updated to handle the new behavior for multiple ignored classes.\n\n3. **Documenter.filter_members**: This method filters the members based on various criteria, including inherited members. The method contains logic to exclude members based on inheritance and will need to be modified to support ignoring multiple specified classes.\n\n4. **ClassDocumenter.__init__ and ModuleDocumenter.__init__**: These initialization methods set up the documenters for classes and modules. The `merge_members_option` function call might need to be adjusted to handle the new list-based :inherited-members: option.\n\nBy focusing on these key areas, we can address the requirement to support multiple classes in the :inherited-members: option.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
