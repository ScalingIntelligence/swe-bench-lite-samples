This feature would allow users to specify a list of classes to ignore, which is currently not supported. Relevant files include those within the sphinx/ext/autodoc directory, particularly those that handle class and module documentation, such as __init__.py, directive.py, and importer.py.

This enhancement would allow users to specify which base classes' members should be ignored when documenting derived classes. The search results provided contain several relevant code spans in 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py', particularly in the 'Documenter' class, 'ClassDocumenter' class, and 'ModuleDocumenter' class. These classes and methods handle various aspects of documenting Python objects, including inherited members. The 'Documenter.filter_members' method specifically deals with filtering members during documentation based on certain conditions, which includes handling inherited members. The 'ClassDocumenter' class also has methods that handle the import and documentation of class objects, including inherited members. These code spans provide a solid base for understanding how the current system handles inherited members and could be modified to support the new functionality requested in the issue. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant and should be considered for further development to implement the requested feature.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
