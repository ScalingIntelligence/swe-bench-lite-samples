This functionality is currently not available and requires modifications in the relevant parts of the autodoc extension to implement. Key files and functions to consider include `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, specifically class `ClassDocumenter` and its method `get_object_members`, and `sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py`, particularly `InheritanceGraph` and its method `_import_classes`. These parts of the code are central to how inherited members are managed and documented in Sphinx. To address the issue, it is essential to identify where the logic for inherited members is defined and manipulated and then extend this logic to accommodate the new feature of ignoring specific inherited classes.",

The identified code spans in the search results are relevant to this issue. Specifically, the 'ClassDocumenter' class is instrumental in how Sphinx documents classes. The 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members' method is particularly relevant because it currently filters inherited members based on the 'inherited_members' option. These findings suggest that modifying this method to accept and handle a list of classes for ignoring inherited members is a viable approach to address the issue. Therefore, these code spans are likely the best starting point for implementing the enhancements described in the feature request.",

Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
