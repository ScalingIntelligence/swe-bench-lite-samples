The current implementation in sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py suggests that the inherited_members_option function and related methods might need modification to handle multiple classes. Relevant classes that could be affected include ModuleDocumenter, ClassDocumenter, and potentially others within the Documenter hierarchy due to their involvement in member documentation. Moreover, the InheritanceGraph class in sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py might play a role in how class inheritance is currently handled, making it another potential candidate for updates. Unfortunately, specific code snippets detailing the current behavior weren't provided, so a more targeted search based on known patterns in Sphinx Autodoc would be necessary to pinpoint exact lines of code to update. Given the complexity of the feature request, additional searches around class inheritance behavior and member filtering, especially in contexts involving modules and classes, would be prudent.",

The search results reveal several relevant code spans within Sphinx's autodoc and inheritance_diagram extensions. The 'ClassDocumenter' class in 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' is particularly relevant as it directly handles the documentation of class members and already has an option for 'inherited-members'. The 'Documenter.filter_members' and 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members' methods are crucial for filtering and retrieving class members, and could be extended to handle multiple class specifications. Additionally, the 'InheritanceGraph' class in 'sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py' offers insights into handling class inheritance but is not directly related to the 'inherited-members' option. The identified spans provide a comprehensive starting point for implementing the requested feature, particularly in 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py'.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
