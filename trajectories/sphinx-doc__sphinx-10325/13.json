The search results provided contain several relevant code spans that could be extended or modified to implement this feature:\n\n1. The `inherited_members_option` function currently handles the :inherited-members: option, converting it into a recognizable format. This function would need to be updated to accept and process a list of classes.\n2. The `ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter` classes both use this option in their `option_spec`. These classes would need to be updated to handle the extended functionality of the option.\n3. The `merge_members_option` function is also relevant as it processes the members to be documented, which would include handling the ignored classes from the :inherited-members: option.\n\nThese code spans are found in the same file, suggesting that the implementation of this feature would likely require modifications within this file. Additional code may be needed to fully implement the feature, which could include adding new methods or updating existing ones to handle the list of ignored classes. The `ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter` classes are particularly important as they are directly involved in the documentation process and would need to be able to handle the new functionality.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
