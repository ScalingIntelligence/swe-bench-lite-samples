This involves understanding how classes are documented and how inherited members are processed in the Sphinx autodoc extension. The main focus should be on the `ClassDocumenter` and `Documenter` classes and their methods like `get_object_members` and `filter_members`, which are pivotal in determining which inherited members to document. Additionally, the `get_class_members` function in `importer.py` might also be relevant as it retrieves class members.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue suggests enhancing the `:inherited-members:` option to support a list of classes for selective inheritance documentation. This requires modifications in how members are filtered and documented, especially in the context of classes that inherit from multiple base classes. Analysis of the search results reveals key sections within the `Documenter` class, particularly `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, and `document_members`, which handle member fetching and filtering. These methods could be adapted to accept and handle a list of classes to exclude when documenting inherited members. Additionally, the `ClassDocumenter` class, with methods like `get_object_members` and `document_members`, is relevant for handling class-specific documentation, which may need to integrate the new functionality. Further, `get_object_members` in `ModuleDocumenter` is identified as a candidate for integration if the functionality is to be applied at the module level as per the second part of the issue description. The search results indicate potential areas for implementing the new feature, aligning closely with the requirements of the reported issue.",

The `get_object_members` method in `ClassDocumenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` is particularly relevant as it controls which members are considered for documentation. Additionally, the `filter_members` method in `Documenter` includes logic for excluding or including inherited members based on options like `inherited_members`.

Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
