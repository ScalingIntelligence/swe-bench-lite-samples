  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
