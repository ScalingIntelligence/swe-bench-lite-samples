This involves modifying the behavior of how base class members are handled during documentation generation. The relevant code is likely located in the autodoc extension where the logic for handling inherited members and documenting classes resides. Specific methods to focus on include `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, and possibly `document_members` in classes like `Documenter`, `ClassDocumenter`, and `ModuleDocumenter`. Additionally, the parsing and handling of options in directives like `automodule` should be examined.",

This involves updating the way inherited members are handled, allowing specified base classes to be ignored during documentation generation. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans that deal with the handling of inherited members and the configuration of autodoc options. These include functions like inherited_members_option and the Documenter class, which is central to autodoc's functionality for documenting various types of Python objects. The Documenter class methods, such as get_object_members and filter_members, are particularly relevant as they are responsible for managing and filtering members of documented objects. Additionally, the ClassDocumenter and ModuleDocumenter classes extend Documenter and provide specific handling for class and module documentation, respectively. The setup function is also important as it initializes and configures various autodoc features within Sphinx. These code spans should be examined in detail to understand how they currently handle inherited member documentation and to identify potential modifications or additions needed to support the requested feature.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
