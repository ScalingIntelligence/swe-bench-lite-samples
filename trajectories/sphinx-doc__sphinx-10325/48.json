The main files to focus on are those related to the autodoc extension. The relevant classes and functions to look for include those that handle the inherited members option, class documentation, and any methods related to filtering or managing inherited members. Specifically, functions like 'get_object_members', 'filter_members', and classes like 'ClassDocumenter' and 'ModuleDocumenter' are likely to have code impacting this feature. Additionally, relevant methods within these classes, such as 'document_members', 'add_content', and 'generate', should be examined.",

The issue specifically mentions two scenarios: allowing inherited members from specific base classes while ignoring others, and ignoring inherited members from specific base classes across a module. The search results show several key methods and classes in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module that are likely relevant: `Documenter`, `ClassDocumenter`, `ModuleDocumenter`, and their respective methods for handling inherited members, such as `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, and `document_members`. These methods currently handle the `inherited_members` option, but they do not support specifying multiple classes or ignoring specific base classes. Therefore, modifications to these methods and potentially new helper methods will be needed to implement the desired functionality.",

Additionally, the ModuleDocumenter and ClassDocumenter classes are also relevant as they handle module and class-level documentation, respectively. These classes and their methods suggest that they manage options like 'inherited-members' and 'exclude-members', which are central to the feature request.

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
