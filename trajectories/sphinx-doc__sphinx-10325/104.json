The search results reveal relevant code spans within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file, particularly in the `Documenter` class. The methods `get_object_members` and `filter_members` are highly relevant as they handle the retrieval and filtering of members, including inherited members. These methods currently support filtering based on single inherited classes but do not support lists, which aligns with the feature request. The `ClassDocumenter` class is also relevant as it subclasses `Documenter` and specializes in documenting classes, necessitating adjustments to handle the new functionality. The code spans identified provide a solid foundation for implementing the requested feature. Therefore, the search is determined to be complete based on the identified relevant code spans.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
