This would handle scenarios where multiple inheritance is used and some base classes should be excluded from documentation. The search results reveal the current implementation of the inherited_members_option function, which currently handles only a single class or a boolean value. This function would likely need to be adjusted to accept and process a list of classes. Additionally, the ClassDocumenter class sets up the option_spec, which includes the 'inherited-members' option handled by the inherited_members_option function. This integration point will be crucial for implementing the new functionality. The setup function configures various aspects of autodoc, and changes here might also be required to support the new feature request. Given the context and the search results, the identified code spans include the current handling of the 'inherited-members' option and the central ClassDocumenter class, which will be the main entry point for implementing the new functionality.",

Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
