The key function to focus on is `get_object_members`, as it determines which members of a class are documented based on whether the base classes are inherited members. The search results show that the current implementation checks for `self.options.inherited_members`, but it doesn't handle multiple classes or an exclude list. This suggests that modifications are needed here to implement the feature request. Additionally, the `__init__` method of `ClassDocumenter` might need adjustments if configuration options need to support new functionality. Thus, the identified spans are relevant to the issue because they set the foundation for what needs to be modified or extended to support the new feature of handling more than one class in the `:inherited-members:` option.",

The analysis of the provided file context and search results shows that the `ClassDocumenter` class already handles options related to members and inherited members. However, the current implementation does not support ignoring specific classes from the inherited members list. The `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members` method is particularly relevant as it determines which members to document based on the inherited_members option. To address the issue, we need to update this method to account for a list of classes to ignore, which is not currently handled. The search result only provides a partial view of the `ClassDocumenter` class, missing some key parts referenced in the file context, such as the option_spec definition. However, based on the identified spans in the search results, the areas to focus on for implementing the new functionality are ClassDocumenter's __init__ method for handling options and the get_object_members method for filtering members based on the new 'ignore-inherited-members' list option. This implementation should ensure that when processing inherited members, any members from classes specified in the 'ignore-inherited-members' list are excluded.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
