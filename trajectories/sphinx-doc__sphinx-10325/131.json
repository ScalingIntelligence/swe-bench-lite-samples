The search results include the ClassDocumenter class, which is relevant as it involves the handling of class documentation and inherited members. Specifically, the 'get_object_members' method in ClassDocumenter seems to control the inclusion of members from base classes. This method could be modified to accept a list of classes to ignore, aligning with the proposed solution. This is a relevant code span as it directly relates to the handling of inherited members in class documentation. The other methods in ClassDocumenter, such as '__init__', while relevant, do not directly address the inherited-members functionality. Therefore, the primary focus is on the 'get_object_members' method for implementing the requested feature.",

Specifically, it should be able to ignore certain base classes while documenting others. The current implementation in the provided search results shows that the `:inherited-members:` option currently only supports a single class name or 'object'. The main relevant code spans are found in the `ClassDocumenter` class, particularly the `get_object_members` method, which handles the filtering of members based on the `inherited_members` option. Additionally, the `inherited_members_option` function defines how this option is parsed. To address the issue, modifications will be needed in these areas to allow for multiple class names to be specified and processed.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
