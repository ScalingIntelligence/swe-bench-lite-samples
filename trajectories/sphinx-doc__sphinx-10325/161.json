The relevant spans of code are likely in the ModuleDocumenter and ClassDocumenter classes since these are responsible for documenting modules and classes respectively. The __init__ and get_object_members methods within these classes seem to be handling options and determining which members to document or skip, which is directly related to the issue at hand. These methods will need to be extended to support a list of classes to be ignored, as specified in the request. The get_object_members methods in both ModuleDocumenter and ClassDocumenter seem crucial as they currently handle the logic of deciding which members to include or exclude based on the options provided. Therefore, modifications or additions to how these methods process the inherited_members option will be necessary to implement the desired functionality.",

I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
