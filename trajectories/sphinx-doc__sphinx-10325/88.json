This would require modifications to the Documenter class and its methods, particularly those dealing with member filtering and documentation. In the search results, several relevant code spans were found in sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py. These spans include the Documenter class definition, its `__init__` method, the `get_object_members` method, and the `filter_members` method. These are critical as they involve the handling of inherited members and the logic for which members to include or exclude from documentation. Additionally, the `ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter` classes and their methods were identified as relevant, especially their implementations of `get_object_members`, which are crucial for understanding how module- and class-level members are processed. The `get_object_members` function in sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py is also relevant as it defines how object members are retrieved, which is a foundational part of the inherited members feature request. These findings indicate that the identified code spans are likely to be key in addressing the issue, although further analysis may be needed to fully understand the impact and necessary changes.",

The issue specifically mentions enhancing the :inherited-members: option to support a list of classes, which aligns with the filtering logic present in the filter_members method of the Documenter class. Additionally, the ClassDocumenter and ModuleDocumenter classes explicitly handle the 'inherited-members' option, which indicates that the necessary code to modify or extend this behavior for list support is already present or at least partially addressed in the provided context.

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
