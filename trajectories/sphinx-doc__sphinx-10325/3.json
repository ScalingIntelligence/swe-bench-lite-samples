There are two specific use cases: one where a class inherits from multiple other classes, and another where specific base classes (like list, set, tuple) should be ignored in the documentation. The main functionality to focus on is the 'inherited-members' option in automodule, which currently seems to handle inherited members but doesn't support specifying a list of classes to ignore or include selectively. The relevant code appears to be in the 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' file, particularly the 'ClassDocumenter' class, which deals with documenting classes, including their inherited members. Additionally, other utility functions and classes like 'get_object_members', 'filter_members', and 'document_members' might also be relevant. The 'inheritance_diagram.py' file also seems relevant for understanding how inheritance is currently handled and possibly extended for this feature. No files have been identified yet, so the initial focus should be on the 'ClassDocumenter' class and related functions in the 'autodoc' module to identify where and how the inherited members functionality can be enhanced to support a list of classes.",

This task involves analyzing the existing codebase within Sphinx's autodoc extension to identify where this enhancement could be implemented. From the provided search results, the `Documenter` class and its subclasses (`ModuleDocumenter`, `ClassDocumenter`) stand out as the primary candidates for this enhancement, as they handle the documentation of various objects, including modules and classes, and their members. Specific methods like `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, and `document_members` in the `Documenter` class, as well as similar methods in `ClassDocumenter`, deal with the retrieval and filtering of members, which suggests they might be the best entry points for modifying how inherited members are handled. These methods currently consider the `inherited-members` option but do not support a list of classes for exclusion or inclusion. Extending these methods to accept and process a list of classes aligns directly with the described feature request. Therefore, these identified code spans are highly relevant to the task.",

Specifically, it seeks to address two scenarios: 1) Documenting members from some base classes while ignoring others when a class inherits from multiple classes. 2) Documenting all other inherited members in a module while ignoring members from specified base classes (like list, set, tuple). The provided file context and search results from 'sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py' notably involve the Documenter, ModuleDocumenter, and ClassDocumenter classes, which are central to how Sphinx handles documentation auto-generation. These classes contain methods like get_object_members, filter_members, and document_members, which are critical for determining which members are documented and how they are filtered. The current implementation of the :inherited-members: option uses a straightforward approach that likely applies to all inherited members unless explicitly excluded. Enhancing this functionality to accept a list of classes would require modifications to these methods, particularly in how they filter and process inherited members during the documentation generation process.",

The 'get_object_members' method in 'ClassDocumenter' retrieves members of a class, and 'document_members' processes them for documentation. The 'filter_members' method in 'Documenter' appears to be used for filtering members based on various criteria such as privacy, documentation status, and inherited members. The 'inherited-members' option is currently supported but appears to handle only a single class, not a list. This suggests that enhancements may be needed in these methods to support documenting inherited members from multiple classes selectively.

Currently, the codebase within `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` shows that the `inherited_members` option is already integrated with the `Documenter` class and its subclasses like `ClassDocumenter` and `ModuleDocumenter`. However, it appears that the option currently only supports a single class, not a list. The relevant code spans identified include methods and attributes related to member filtering and documentation within these classes (e.g., `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, `document_members`). These parts of the code handle the logic for deciding which members to include in documentation based on inheritance. To address the issue, modifications would likely be needed to accept and process a list of classes in the `inherited_members` option and adjust the member filtering logic accordingly.",

This suggests that the functionality to handle inherited members selectively \u2013 as described in the issue \u2013 is not yet implemented in the provided code.

I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
