This should address cases where classes inherit from multiple classes, and there's a need to selectively ignore certain base classes. Relevant code is likely to be found in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file, focusing on the `ClassDocumenter` class and its methods, especially `get_object_members` and `filter_members`, as these involve the documentation of inherited members. Also, the `inherited_members_option` function might be relevant for parsing the new option format.",

The provided search results contain several relevant code spans that can be analyzed to determine their relevance to the issue. Notably, the `Documenter` class and its methods `get_object_members` and `filter_members` are significant as they currently handle the logic for inherited members. The `ClassDocumenter` class also contains key methods and initialization logic that could be affected by the proposed enhancement. Further, the `inherited_members_option` function processes the `inherited-members` option. These code spans are likely where enhancements would be made to support the new functionality of accepting a list of classes for the `:inherited-members:` option.",

Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
