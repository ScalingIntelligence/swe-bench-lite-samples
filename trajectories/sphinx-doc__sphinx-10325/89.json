This would address two scenarios: 1) A class inheriting from multiple classes, where documentation of some base classes is desired while others are ignored. 2) A module containing multiple classes inheriting from various classes, where inheritance from specific classes like list, set, and tuple should be ignored. The search results focus on the ModuleDocumenter and ClassDocumenter classes, which handle the documentation of modules and classes, respectively. Key methods include get_object_members and __init__, which manage the retrieval of members and initial setup of options such as 'inherited-members'. The current implementation primarily addresses the member options but lacks specific handling for lists of inherited classes. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant as they contribute to the management of class and module documentation, including inherited members, which is directly related to the feature request. Expanding on these will likely be necessary to implement the desired functionality.",

I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
