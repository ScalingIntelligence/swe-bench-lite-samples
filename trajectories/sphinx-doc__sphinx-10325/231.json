This would allow users to specify multiple base classes whose members should be ignored when documenting a class. The current codebase already contains some relevant functions and classes, such as 'merge_members_option', 'Documenter', 'ModuleDocumenter', and 'ClassDocumenter', which handle the merging of options and the documentation of modules and classes, respectively. In the provided search results, the 'ModuleDocumenter' and 'ClassDocumenter' classes are again highlighted, along with their '__init__' methods where 'merge_members_option' is called. These classes and methods are crucial as they initialize the options for documenting modules and classes, which includes handling the 'inherited-members' option. The 'Documenter.filter_members' method is particularly important as it contains the logic for filtering members based on various options, including 'inherited-members'. However, the implementation of 'inherited-members' still seems to be based on a single class, not a list. This indicates that the new functionality needs to be implemented in the 'filter_members' method to support a list of inherited members. Since the required functionality is not yet implemented and the relevant code spans are provided in the search results, it is confirmed that the search for relevant code is complete.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
