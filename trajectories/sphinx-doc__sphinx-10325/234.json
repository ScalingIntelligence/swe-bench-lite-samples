The identified code spans include the ModuleDocumenter and ClassDocumenter classes within Sphinx's autodoc extension. These classes handle the documentation of modules and classes respectively and contain methods related to member documentation handling. Notably, the 'get_object_members' method in both classes is pertinent as it would need modification to accommodate the new functionality of ignoring specified base classes. This method currently deals with retrieving members of modules or classes, a critical part of the documentation process where the filtering should be applied based on the new 'inherited-members' list. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to addressing the issue as they form the basis of where the new logic for ignoring classes should be integrated.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
