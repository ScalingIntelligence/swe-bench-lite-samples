The search results provide several relevant code spans in the `Documenter` class and its subclasses (`ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter`), particularly focusing on methods like `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, and `document_members`. These methods handle the retrieval, filtering, and documentation of members, including inherited members, which aligns with the request to enhance the handling of inherited members. The `Documenter.get_object_members` method is central as it currently processes inherited members based on options, suggesting a potential entry point for implementing the new functionality. The `Documenter.filter_members` method also plays a crucial role in deciding which members to include, making it a key area for modification to handle the new list-based filtering approach. These code spans provide a comprehensive context for understanding how inherited members are currently managed and how they could be enhanced to support more granular control through a list of classes.",

Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
