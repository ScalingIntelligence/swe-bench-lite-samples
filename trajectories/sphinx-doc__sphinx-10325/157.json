The issue requests that this option be extended to accept a list of classes to be ignored when documenting inherited members. From the provided search results, we can see the `ModuleDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter` classes, which handle the documentation of modules and classes respectively. Both classes have a method `get_object_members` that deals with determining which members to document. Additionally, there's a method `get_class_members` which seems to fetch members of a class and could be relevant to how inherited members are handled. These code spans are likely candidates for implementing the new functionality as they deal directly with the members of modules and classes.",

Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
