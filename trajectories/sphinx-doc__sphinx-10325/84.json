This involves modifying how members are documented, especially focusing on inherited members. The provided code context in sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py contains several key spans that are relevant: 1. 'Documenter.get_object_members': This method retrieves members of an object, and it has a conditional for inherited_members that might need modification to handle a list of ignored classes. 2. 'Documenter.filter_members': This method filters and processes members, including checking for inherited members and applying filters based on options. The method could be updated to add handling for a list of ignored classes. 3. 'ClassDocumenter.get_object_members': This is a specific implementation for class members that also needs to respect the new feature of ignoring specified inherited classes. The broader context suggests that changes across Documenter, ClassDocumenter, and possibly other components like ModuleDocumenter need to be implemented to fully support the feature.",

  "initial_message": "inherited-members should support more than one class\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI have two situations:\r\n- A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes\r\n- A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n"
