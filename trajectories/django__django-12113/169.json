Given this context, I analyzed the provided search results and the current file context. The code spans provided in the file context (django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py and django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py) are already relevant as they deal with database creation and SQLite database handling. The search results, especially the 'DatabaseWrapper' class in django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py, also directly relate to SQLite database operations and management, which is critical for understanding and addressing the 'database is locked' issue. Therefore, I identified the relevant code spans in the provided search results, focusing on those that are related to database management and operations in SQLite.
