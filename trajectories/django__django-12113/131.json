The identified files and spans seem to be related to the SQLite database backend implementation in Django. The new search results expand on this, providing additional spans related to database connection management, cursor operations, and various SQL functions executed on the SQLite database. These new spans are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue because they directly involve the SQLite database operations and handling, which are likely to be impacted by the persistence and potential locking issues. However, further inspection of these spans is required to pinpoint the exact cause of the locked database error and to understand if any additional spans might be needed.

This class is central to managing the lifecycle of database connections and executing SQL operations, which could directly relate to the 'database is locked' issue during tests. The `get_new_connection` method, for example, shows how new database connections are established and configured, which is crucial for understanding how SQLite handles concurrent connections and potential locking issues. Additionally, the `SQLiteCursorWrapper` class handles the execution of SQL queries, which could also be relevant to the issue if query execution contributes to locking. The detailed configuration of database functions and handling of date-time operations also indicates that the file context covers a significant portion of SQLite-specific functionality in Django. Thus, while the file context does not directly point out solutions to SQLite locking issues, it provides a substantial foundation for further investigation into SQLite's handling of concurrent operations and error management within Django's test environment.",
