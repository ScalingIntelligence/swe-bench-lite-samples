This seems to be related to how the database connections are handled during tests, especially when using persistent test databases and parallel execution. I need to identify the parts of the code dealing with SQLite database creation and management during tests to understand how to mitigate this error. The goal is to ensure that database locking issues are properly handled to allow for smooth testing, even with persistent and parallelized test patterns.",

The search results provide significant context related to SQLite database creation, management, and potential issues with locking and cloning. Specifically, the Django code spans from django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py and django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py are highly relevant as they directly deal with SQLite database handling, including the creation of test databases, management of in-memory databases, and the handling of database connections and cursors. These code spans offer insights into how SQLite databases are managed within Django's test environment, which is crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the 'database is locked' issue reported.

The DatabaseWrapper class in django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py manages connections to the SQLite database, including creating cursors and managing connection states. Notably, the close method appears to handle closing an SQLite connection and checks if the database is not in-memory before proceeding with the closure. Though specific methods to resolve the 'database is locked' issue are not explicitly provided, these classes and methods are likely where changes would be made to mitigate the error. Thus, it seems likely that modifying these classes to better manage database connections, particularly under the conditions specified in the issue (persistent databases and parallel execution), could resolve the issue.
