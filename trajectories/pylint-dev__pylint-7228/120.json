This information is crucial as it shows the entire process from command invocation to configuration loading and execution, which helps in identifying where the error might be originating from. Given the specific error related to the regular expression and the context provided in the `_ArgumentsManager` and `Option` classes, the spans identified in the `config` directory are directly relevant.
