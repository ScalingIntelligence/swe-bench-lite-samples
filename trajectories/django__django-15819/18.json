To address this, we need to focus on the logic within the inspectdb command, specifically how it handles the generation of model fields and their relations. Additionally, we should look into the related.py file where the RelatedField class and its subclasses are defined, as this is where the related_name logic is likely implemented. Furthermore, examining the base.py file could provide insights into how model fields are checked for clashes, which is directly related to the issue at hand.",

This results in clashes that require manual intervention. The solution requires modifications to the way related_name arguments are handled during the inspectdb process, potentially by autogenerating related_name attributes if they are not already provided. The search results provided include several relevant code spans: 1. 'RelatedField' class and its '__init__' method, which handles the related_name parameter. This is directly related to the field in question. 2. 'ForeignKey' and 'ManyToManyField' classes, both of which inherit from 'RelatedField' and handle specific types of relationships that commonly require related_name. 3. 'RelatedField.contribute_to_class' method, which is used to add the field to the class and handle the related name assignment. These sections of code are directly involved in the creation and management of related names for fields in Django models, making them highly relevant to the reported issue. By examining and potentially modifying these code spans, we can address the issue of related_name generation during the inspectdb process. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant and should help in addressing the reported issue.",
