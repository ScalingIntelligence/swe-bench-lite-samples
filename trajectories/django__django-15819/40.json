This issue can be resolved by generating a custom 'related_name' argument for each field during the model generation process. The relevant sections of code from the search results that could be modified to implement this solution are located in the 'inspectdb.py' and 'related.py' files. The 'Command.handle_inspection' function in 'inspectdb.py' is directly responsible for generating the model output, and the 'RelatedField.contribute_to_class' function in 'related.py' is involved in the process of contributing fields to a model class.

The context provided includes the methods handle_inspection and normalize_col_name from the Command class in the inspectdb file, which are relevant for identifying and normalizing column names and handling table inspections. Additionally, the related.py file contains the RelatedField class with methods _check_clashes and contribute_to_class, which are crucial for checking and contributing related fields during class preparation. The base.py file also includes the Model class with methods _prepare_related_fields_for_save and _check_field_name_clashes, which prepare related fields for save operations and check for field name clashes, respectively. Analyzing the new search results, I observe continuity in the specificity and relevance of the code spans provided. The search results primarily focus on the Command class's method handle_inspection and the RelatedField class's method _check_clashes, confirming the intended functionality related to inspecting database tables and checking for field clashes, which are key to addressing the issue reported.
