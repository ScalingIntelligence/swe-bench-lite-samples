This is a common issue when using `inspectdb` to automatically create models from an existing database schema. The issue suggests autogenerating `related_name` attributes to avoid clashes. From the search results, we need to identify code spans that handle model field relationships and potential clashes, especially those related to checking for field name clashes and handling related fields. The `Model._check_field_name_clashes` method in `django/db/models/base.py` is particularly relevant as it checks for field name clashes and could be extended or modified to address the issue. Additionally, the `ProjectState` class in `django/db/migrations/state.py` deals with resolving model field relations, which could be relevant for implementing a solution that involves autogenerating `related_name` attributes.",
