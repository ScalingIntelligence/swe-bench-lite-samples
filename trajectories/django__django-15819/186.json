We need to investigate the inspectdb command logic to identify where related_name attributes can be added during model generation. The target files include django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py, django/db/models/fields/related.py, and possibly others where model field definitions and their relation handling are managed. We should look for places where relations are defined and checked for clashes, focusing on methods related to field contribution to classes, especially ForeignKey and ManyToManyField definitions.",

This requires modifying the `inspectdb` command's logic for generating model fields to include `related_name` where necessary. The relevant code spans are found in `inspectdb.py` under `django/core/management/commands/` where the command class and methods related to field normalization and generation are located. Particularly, the `normalize_col_name` and `handle_inspection` methods should be inspected and possibly modified to include auto-generation of `related_name` if a reverse accessor clash is detected. Additionally, understanding how Django models handle field parameters in `base.py` and the specifics of related fields in `related.py` is crucial for implementing this change correctly.",

The current file context includes parts of the `inspectdb` command and related field definitions from `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. Upon examining the new search results, particularly the `inspectdb` command's `handle_inspection` method and the related field initialization methods in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, there are clear references to handling related fields and generating model code. However, the code currently does not explicitly demonstrate the automatic generation of `related_name` for fields that are relations to the same model. This suggests that the modification to support this feature would likely involve enhancing the `normalize_col_name` or `get_field_type` methods in the `inspectdb` command or adjusting the field initialization logic to automatically infer `related_name` when appropriate.",
