The error indicates that reverse accessors for fields in the same model are clashing, suggesting that related_name arguments should be added or changed. To address this, we need to identify the part of the code where inspectdb generates model fields and ensure that related_name arguments are automatically generated when the same model is used for the table. We should search the inspectdb command, related fields handling, and model generation logic to find the relevant parts of code.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the inspectdb command not generating related_name attributes for fields that reference the same model, leading to clashes. This is a common issue when a model has multiple foreign keys to the same model, and Django's inspectdb command does not automatically generate unique related_name attributes. The primary places to address this issue are in the inspectdb command itself, which is responsible for generating model code from database tables, and in the related field classes where these attributes are managed.\n\nFrom the search results, we can pinpoint the following relevant areas:\n\n1. **django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py**: This file contains the logic for the inspectdb command. It includes the `Command` class with methods like `handle` and `handle_inspection`, which are directly responsible for generating model code based on database inspection. The code provided does not show specific handling for related_name conflicts, suggesting this might be an area of focus.\n\n2. **django/db/models/fields/related.py**: This file houses the `RelatedField` class, which is a base class for fields that have relationships to other models, such as `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField`. The `RelatedField` class contains methods like `_check_related_name_is_valid`, `_check_related_query_name_is_valid`, and `_check_clashes`, which are related to validating related names.\n\n3. **django/db/models/base.py**: This file includes the `Model` class, which is a base class for all Django models. It contains various checks that are run on the model to ensure its validity, including checks for field name clashes and single primary keys. Methods such as `_check_m2m_through_same_relationship` and `_check_field_name_clashes` are relevant as they check for potential issues related to field names and relationships.\n\nGiven these findings, the areas identified are crucial for addressing the issue of related_name collisions when using inspectdb. The code spans from these files can be targeted to develop a solution that automatically generates unique related_name attributes or warns about the need for manual assignment.\n\nBy focusing on these code spans, we can develop a solution that either modifies the inspectdb command to auto-generate related_name attributes or improve the error handling around related_name clashes to make them easier to spot and resolve during model generation.",
