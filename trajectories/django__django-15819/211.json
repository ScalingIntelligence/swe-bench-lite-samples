This happens because the related_name arguments are not being properly generated for fields in models when the related Model is used for the same table. The solution might involve modifying the 'inspectdb' command and related modules like 'django.db.models.fields.related' and 'django.db.models.base' to ensure related_name is autogenerated to avoid clashes. Relevant functions to look into include 'handle_inspection' in 'inspectdb.py', '_check_clashes' and 'contribute_to_class' in 'related.py', and '_check_field_name_clashes' in 'base.py'.",

The reported issue suggests that the `related_name` argument for related fields should be generated automatically to avoid clashes. The analysis of the search results reveals several key sections of code which are potentially relevant to addressing this issue:\n\n1. **django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py**\n- This file contains the implementation of the `inspectdb` command. The `Command` class in this file is responsible for introspecting the database tables and generating Django model code. Specific spans such as `Command.handle_inspection`, `Command.normalize_col_name`, and `Command.get_field_type` contain logic that is fundamental to understanding how model fields, including related fields, are generated.\n- Span `Command.handle_inspection` specifically deals with generating model code and could be the point where improvements or modifications can be made to include automatic generation of `related_name`.\n- Spans `Command.normalize_col_name` and `Command.get_field_type` are related to understanding the type and characteristics of fields being processed.\n\n2. **django/db/models/fields/related.py**\n- This file contains the definitions for related fields such as `RelatedField`, `ManyToManyField`, etc. The spans like `RelatedField.contribute_to_class` and `ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class` are crucial as they involve the process of adding these fields to the model class.\n- Span `RelatedField.contribute_to_class` handles how related fields contribute to the model class definition, and modifying this could influence how `related_name` is handled during this process.\n\nIt is clear from the search results that these spans are relevant to the reported issue as they either directly or indirectly influence the generation and handling of related fields in the Django ORM and model definitions.",

This issue is specifically related to the handling of `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` in Django's ORM, and how the `related_name` attribute is managed to avoid clashes. The provided search results include both the `inspectdb` command and the `related.py` file which defines `ForeignKey`, `OneToOneField`, and their underlying mechanisms. The `Command.handle_inspection` method in `inspectdb` seems crucial for the reported issue as it is responsible for generating Django model modules based on database introspection. However, it currently lacks the ability to automatically generate `related_name` attributes to avoid clashes. On the other hand, `ForeignKey.__init__` and `RelatedField.contribute_to_class` in `related.py` show how `related_name` is initialized and contributed to the class, which is essential knowledge for implementing the autogeneration of `related_name`. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
