The focus should be on locating where the inspectdb command handles the generation of these related_name attributes, and possibly extending or modifying this logic to automatically generate unique related_name attributes when a relation to the same entity is detected.\n\nRelevant files and methods to investigate include:\n- The Command class in django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py for the main logic of the inspectdb command.\n- RelatedField and its subclasses like ForeignKey and ManyToManyField in django/db/models/fields/related.py, which should be checked for how related_name is handled.\n- The Model class in django/db/models/base.py, where field name clashes are checked.\n- Methods in django/db/migrations/state.py dealing with model state and relations.",

The search results include several relevant files and spans of code that deal with the inspection and generation of model fields, especially regarding related fields. The following spans are particularly relevant:\n\n1. **django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py**: This file contains the Command class which is responsible for the inspectdb command functionality. Specifically, the 'Command.handle_inspection' and 'Command.normalize_col_name' spans are relevant as they handle the inspection process and normalization of column names, which could be extended to include the generation of related_name attributes.\n\n2. **django/db/models/fields/related.py**: This file contains the RelatedField class and its subclasses such as ManyToManyField, which deal with related fields in Django models. The '_check_related_name_is_valid' and 'contribute_to_class' spans are relevant as they check the validity of related_name attributes and contribute fields to model classes, providing hooks to modify or generate related_name attributes.\n\n3. **django/db/models/base.py**: This file contains the Model class, which is the base class for all Django models. The '_check_field_name_clashes' span is relevant as it checks for field name clashes that could lead to issues similar to those described in the reported issue.\n\n4. **django/db/migrations/state.py**: This file deals with the state of models during migrations. The 'resolve_model_field_relations' span is relevant as it resolves relations between model fields, indicating where related_name attributes could be managed or modified during the migration process.\n\nConsidering these spans, it is possible to identify areas where the generation of related_name attributes could be integrated or modified to address the reported issue.",

The Model class in base.py includes checks for field name clashes, which is a potential point to integrate the auto-generation logic for related_name to avoid such clashes.
