This leads to clashes in reverse accessor names. The search results include multiple files related to Django's model field definitions and migrations. I will analyze if these files and code spans are relevant to the issue or not. First, I look at 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'. This file contains definitions for 'RelatedField' and 'ForeignKey', which are crucial for handling relations between models. Specifically, by focusing on the '_check_related_name_is_valid' and '__init__' methods within 'RelatedField', I can assess their relevance. These methods handle the validation of 'related_name' and its initialization. Further, 'ForeignKey' inherits from 'RelatedField', making it also relevant. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'Model' class contains the '__init__' method, which is responsible for initializing model instances and could potentially interact with related fields, although it appears to be less directly related to the issue at hand. Lastly, in 'django/db/migrations/state.py', the '_find_reload_model' method is used during migrations and checks for related models, which is indirectly related to the issue but might impact how models are reloaded and relations are handled. Thus, the most relevant spans are those related to 'related_name' initialization, validation, and the handling of related fields in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'. I will now identify these relevant spans to determine if the search task is complete.",
