The search results include relevant code spans within the 'inspectdb.py' and 'related.py' files. Specifically, in 'inspectdb.py', the 'Command.handle_inspection' method yields model generation comments and handles table inspection, but it does not currently handle the generation of 'related_name' arguments. The 'Command.normalize_col_name' method processes column names but does not address 'related_name'. In 'related.py', the 'RelatedField.__init__' method and 'RelatedField.contribute_to_class' method deal with initializing and contributing related fields, including handling 'related_name'. These methods could be extended to address the issue, particularly in the 'contribute_to_class' method where 'related_name' is set. The 'RelatedField._check_related_name_is_valid' method checks the validity of 'related_name' and could be leveraged to ensure auto-generated names do not clash. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant for addressing the reported issue by extending the functionality to autogenerate 'related_name' where necessary.",

The issue reported involves the generation of 'related_name' attributes to avoid clashes during reverse accessors in the inspectdb command. The code provided includes methods to handle the normalization of column names, relationship definitions, and the contribution of fields to class definitions, which are crucial for addressing the reported issue. The handling of related_name and related_query_name during class contribution can be directly related to the solution. Despite not directly seeing the part of the code that writes the 'related_name' attribute in the output during the inspectdb operation, the context suggests that this functionality lies within or directly references these provided sections. Therefore, these file contexts are likely to be sufficient to address the issue, considering the depth of Django's introspection mechanics documented in the provided code.",
