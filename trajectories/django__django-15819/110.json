This is to prevent clashes between reverse accessors and to ensure that the models generated by inspectdb are functional and clean.\n\nStarting with the analysis of the search results:\n1. The inspectdb command code in 'django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py' is highly relevant as it directly deals with the generation of Django models from database introspection. Specifically, the 'handle_inspection' method is responsible for the actual model generation, including the creation of fields. It does not currently handle the automatic generation of related_name arguments, which is the focus of the issue.\n2. The 'RelatedField' and 'ManyToManyField' classes in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' are also relevant as they define how related fields are handled in models. The 'contribute_to_class' method in these classes is where the related_name argument can be set, but it currently does not automatically generate one based on the table and field names.\n3. The 'Model' class in 'django/db/models/base.py' contains methods for checking field name clashes, which are related to the issue, but the main functionality for addressing the problem lies in the inspectdb command and the related field classes.\n\nFrom these analyses, the most relevant code spans are those from the inspectdb command that deals with model generation and the related field classes that handle setting of related_name arguments. No other parts of the codebase directly handle the generation of related_name arguments based on table and field names as suggested by the issue.",

Ensuring that `related_name` is set appropriately and uniquely can prevent clashes.

This requires understanding how `related_name` is handled within Django's model field definitions and how `inspectdb` processes these fields during model generation. Analyzing the code in `RelatedField.__init__` and `RelatedField.contribute_to_class` shows that `related_name` can be set during field initialization and class contribution. The `handle_inspection` method in `inspectdb` command is central to how models are generated from database tables, and it needs to handle generation of `related_name` appropriately for self-referential relations. Additionally, the checks in `Model._check_field_name_clashes` ensure there are no naming clashes which could be relevant to how `related_name` is uniquely generated or checked for correctness. A potential enhancement would be to modify `handle_inspection` to automatically append or modify `related_name` for fields with the same relation to avoid clashes. Since the current code provided handles some aspects of this, but doesn't explicitly address auto-generation of `related_name` for self-referential relations based on attribute names, a further modification in `inspectdb` might be needed based on the exact requirements.",
