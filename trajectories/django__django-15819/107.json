To address this, we need to investigate the `inspectdb` command's logic and how it handles related fields. We should also check how the related fields are managed in the Django models and how they interact with the database schema. The relevant files and classes to look into are the `inspectdb` command implementation in `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`, the `RelatedField` and `ForeignKey` classes in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, and the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py`. Additionally, we should examine how model fields and their relations are resolved in the migration state and schema definition files.",

This issue is particularly relevant in Django's codebase, specifically within the models and management commands. I have analyzed the provided search results and identified key sections of code that are relevant to this issue. First, in 'django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py', the 'Command' class contains methods such as 'handle_inspection' and 'normalize_col_name' which are critical for the introspection of database tables and the naming of fields. These methods could potentially be modified to include logic for auto-generating 'related_name' attributes. Secondly, in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', the 'RelatedField' class and its subclasses such as 'ManyToManyField' contain methods like '_check_related_name_is_valid' and 'contribute_to_class', which handle the validation and assignment of 'related_name' attributes. These sections of code are directly implicated in the management of related names and thus are central to the resolution of the reported issue. Finally, in 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'Model' class contains methods such as '_check_m2m_through_same_relationship' and '_check_field_name_clashes', whichcheck for potential issues related to reverse accessors and field name clashes. These checks are crucial for identifying where auto-generation of 'related_name' might be necessary. Having reviewed these sections, I am confident that these spans of code are relevant to the reported issue and should be considered for any modifications aimed at implementing the auto-generation of 'related_name' attributes.",
