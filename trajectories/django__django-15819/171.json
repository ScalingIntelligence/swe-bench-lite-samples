Here is a detailed analysis of the provided search results:\n\n1. **django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py**:\n   - This file contains the `Command` class that handles the `inspectdb` command. The `handle_inspection` method and `normalize_col_name` methods are crucial as they are involved in generating model fields and normalizing column names, which could potentially be extended to handle the generation of `related_name` attributes.\n\n2. **django/db/models/fields/related.py**:\n   - This file contains the `RelatedField` class and its subclasses, such as `ManyToManyField`, which manage related fields. The `contribute_to_class` method in `RelatedField` is particularly important as it contributes fields to the model class and handles the `related_name` attribute.\n\n3. **django/db/models/base.py**:\n   - This file contains the `Model` class, which is the base class for all Django models. The `_check_field_name_clashes` method is relevant as it checks for field name clashes, which could be related to the issues reported with reverse accessor clashes.\n\n4. **django/db/migrations/state.py**:\n   - This file contains the `ProjectState` class, which is used during migrations. The `resolve_fields_and_relations` method is relevant as it resolves field and relation references, which could be useful in understanding how relations are managed during migrations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans will focus on the methods mentioned above. These methods are critical in understanding the generation of model fields, handling of related fields, and the resolution of field and relation references. By focusing on these areas, I can better understand how to address the reported issue regarding the generation of `related_name` attributes on same relation links.",
