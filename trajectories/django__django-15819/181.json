The issue specifically mentions the need to autogenerate 'related_name' for fields in a model if the related Model is used for the table. The search results provide several relevant code spans, particularly in the 'inspectdb' command and related field handling classes. The 'inspectdb' command file contains methods like 'handle_inspection' and 'normalize_col_name' which are involved in introspection and normalization of table names and field names. Additionally, the 'RelatedField' class in the 'related.py' file has methods '_check_related_name_is_valid' and '_check_clashes' which are critical for checking and validating related names, ensuring they do not clash with other fields. These methods can be potential entry points for adding the functionality to autogenerate 'related_name' based on attributes or field names, as suggested in the issue.

This functionality would prevent reverse accessor clashes in models generated by inspectdb.\n\nI have reviewed the provided code spans in the search results to identify relevant sections of the codebase that handle the generation of model classes from database tables. The 'handle_inspection' method in the 'Command' class of 'inspectdb.py' is responsible for generating model definitions based on database introspection. This method deals with identifying relationships and generating field definitions, but it does not currently handle the 'related_name' attribute systematically.\n\nAdditionally, I examined the 'RelatedField' class and its methods in 'related.py', specifically '_check_related_name_is_valid' and '_check_clashes', which are relevant for checking the validity of related_name attributes and detecting clashes, respectively. These methods would need to be integrated into the inspectdb logic to determine where and how to add 'related_name' attributes based on the detected relationships.\n\nGiven the current context, the identified code spans are relevant for understanding the existing implementation of model generation and related field validation. However, to fully resolve the reported issue, further modifications would be needed in the 'handle_inspection' method to dynamically add 'related_name' attributes based on the detected relationships between models.",
