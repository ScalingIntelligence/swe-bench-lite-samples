This feature addresses the clash of reverse accessors mentioned in the error message. The search results provided in <search_results> are crucial because they contain the `inspectdb` command's implementation in `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py` where the model generation logic is defined. Several relevant code spans, including `Command.handle_inspection` and `Command.normalize_col_name`, are part of the `inspectdb` command, which handles the introspection and model generation process. These spans are relevant because they contain the main logic that needs to potentially be adjusted to include automatic generation of `related_name`. Additionally, the spans in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` related to `RelatedField._check_related_name_is_valid`, `RelatedField._check_clashes`, `ForeignKey.__init__`, and `ManyToManyField.__init__` are relevant because they handle the validation, initialization, and clash checks for related fields, which is directly related to the issue. Thus, integrating the logic from these spans into the model generation process of the `inspectdb` command is essential for implementing the required feature. Given the complexity of handling the generation of unique `related_name` attributes and avoiding clashes, detailed review and potential modification of these spans will be necessary to ensure the implementation is robust and error-free.",
