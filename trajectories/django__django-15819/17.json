To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the inspectdb command and related field handling in the Django codebase. The search results provide several key sections in the inspectdb command (django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py) and related field handling (django/db/models/fields/related.py). Specifically, the sections related to field normalization, relation handling, and metadata generation are critical. In the inspectdb command, the 'Command.handle_inspection', 'Command.normalize_col_name', 'Command.get_field_type', and 'Command.get_meta' spans are relevant for understanding how fields and relations are processed. For the related field handling, the 'RelatedField.contribute_to_class', 'RelatedField._check_related_name_is_valid', and 'RelatedField._check_clashes' spans are crucial as they deal with attribute contribution and validation, which is directly linked to the related_name attribute generation and collision avoidance.
