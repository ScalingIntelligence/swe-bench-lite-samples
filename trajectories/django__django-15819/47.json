This problem arises when the same model is referenced multiple times in a relationship. To resolve this, we can start by investigating the `inspectdb` command implementation within `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`. Additionally, we should look into the `RelatedField` class and `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` to determine how `related_name` is handled and check for auto-generation possibilities. Further investigation in `django/db/models/base.py` might also be necessary to understand the model field clash checks and their resolutions.",

Specifically, it mentions clashing reverse accessors and suggests auto-generating `related_name` to prevent these clashes.\n\nIn the provided context, the `inspectdb` command's `handle_inspection` method processes table descriptions and generates model classes. It checks relations and generates field descriptions, but it does not currently handle auto-generating `related_name` arguments. The `RelatedField` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` has an `__init__` method that accepts `related_name` as an argument, but it doesn't handle auto-generation.\n\nFrom the search results, the `inspectdb` command's `handle_inspection` method remains the central focus for addressing this issue. Although additional methods like `normalize_col_name` and `get_meta` are present, they don't directly address the generation of `related_name` arguments. Therefore, the main task is to modify the `handle_inspection` method to include logic for auto-generating `related_name` based on the field's attribute name when related models are used.\n\nThe relevant code spans are those that process field descriptions and set up relations in the `handle_inspection` method.",

I reviewed the search results and found code spans that are relevant to this issue. Specifically, I identified the 'handle_inspection' method in 'inspectdb.py' where the model generation logic resides, and the '__init__' method for 'RelatedField' in 'related.py', which handles the initialization of fields with 'related_name'. These code spans directly handle the creation and configuration of 'related_name' attributes, which is crucial for resolving the reported issue. Additionally, the '_check_clashes' method in 'RelatedField' is also relevant as it checks for reverse accessor clashes and would need to be considered when implementing a solution.",
