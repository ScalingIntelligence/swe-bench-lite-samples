This requirement involves modifications in the `inspectdb` command's handling of model generation, specifically focusing on the management of relations between models. The provided search results include several relevant code spans from `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`, `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, and `django/db/models/base.py`. These files are crucial as they handle the core functionality of model introspection (`inspectdb`), definition of related fields, and model base class behavior, respectively. The spans in `inspectdb.py` show where the command is defined and how it processes database tables to generate Django models. This processing includes methods like `handle_inspection` and `normalize_col_name`, which are directly involved in the normalization and inspection of column names, potentially where related_name attributes should be considered. In `related.py`, classes like `ManyToManyField` and its methods (`get_path_info`, `get_reverse_path_info`, `_get_m2m_db_table`) relate to handling many-to-many relationships, where related_name arguments are also essential. `base.py` contains the definition of the `Model` class and its related methods, which are fundamental to understanding how model instances and their fields are managed in Django. These spans provide a basis for identifying potential areas for modification or addition of related_name handling in the model generation process during introspection. However, the specific spans that directly interact with the related_name attribute or manage reverse accessors are not fully covered in the provided spans. This suggests a need for further inspection or inclusion of additional code spans that deal explicitly with related_name handling in Django's model field definitions and introspection processes.",

This feature would help avoid reverse accessor clashes for fields in models. I've identified relevant code spans in the search results that deal with the inspectdb command and related fields. In `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`, the `handle_inspection` method deals with generating model fields based on database introspection. This method iterates over table columns and determines whether a column is a relation to another table. If it is, it decides whether to use a ForeignKey or OneToOneField based on the presence of a unique constraint. Relevant code spans in this file include those that handle the creation of field descriptions and the decision-making process for choosing the appropriate relation type.\n\nIn `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, there are classes for ForeignKey, OneToOneField, and ManyToManyField, all of which accept a related_name parameter. The `__init__` methods for these classes handle the initialization of the related_name attribute. These code spans are relevant because they show how the related_name parameter is used and can be modified to support automatic generation.\n\nGiven the context and the reported issue, the relevant code spans are identified, focusing on the areas that handle the introspection and creation of model fields, as well as the initialization of related fields with the related_name parameter.",
