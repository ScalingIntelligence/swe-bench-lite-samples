The search should focus on the inspectdb command's logic for generating models, specifically where it handles the generation of related_name arguments. Additionally, exploration into the RelatedField class, ForeignKey, and ManyToManyField classes in django.db.models.fields.related is warranted, as these handle related fields and might include methods or checks related to related_name clashes. Finally, the Model class in django.db.models.base also contains methods for checking field name clashes, which is directly related to the issue.",
