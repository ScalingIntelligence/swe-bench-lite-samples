The problem described is that the generated models do not include 'related_name' arguments for fields that reference the same model. This causes a 'fields.E304' error due to reverse accessor clashes. The task is to identify the code in Django responsible for generating these models and potentially related logic in handling related fields. Given the context, the primary focus should be on 'inspectdb.py', 'related.py', 'base.py', and potentially 'options.py' and 'fields/__init__.py' as they contain relevant methods for model generation, related field management, and options handling.",

The `Command` class and its methods like `add_arguments`, `handle`, and `normalize_col_name` are pertinent as they deal with the introspection of database tables and generation of model code.\n\n2. `django/db/models/fields/related.py`: This file contains the implementation of fields related to relationships between models, including `RelatedField`, `ManyToManyField`, and methods like `_check_related_name_is_valid` and `related_query_name`. These are crucial for understanding and manipulating `related_name` attributes.\n\n3. `django/db/models/base.py`: This file includes the base `Model` class and methods like `_check_field_name_clashes`, which check for name clashes, including clashes with `related_name` attributes.\n\n4. `django/db/models/options.py`: This file contains the `Options` class, which manages metadata for models, including relationships and related names. The `_prepare` method is of interest as it sets up related objects.\n\n5. `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`: This file contains various field definitions but does not directly address `related_name` issues. However, it provides context on other field types that might be related in complex model relationships.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans are crucial for handling the generation of `related_name` attributes and resolving clashes with the `inspectdb` command.",
