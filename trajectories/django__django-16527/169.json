This is crucial because 'save_as_new' essentially duplicates an existing object, which should be treated as an 'add' operation in terms of permissions. The issue specifically mentions adding 'and has_add_permission' to the condition that determines whether 'show_save_as_new' should be displayed. \n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant code spans are found in 'django/contrib/admin/options.py':\n\n1. The 'has_add_permission' method is present in the 'BaseModelAdmin' class, which checks if the user has the permission to add a new instance of the model.\n2. The 'ModelAdmin' class, which inherits from 'BaseModelAdmin', contains several methods related to handling responses for adding and changing objects, including 'response_add', 'response_change', and '_changeform_view'.\n3. The '_changeform_view' method is particularly relevant as it handles the logic for displaying the change form, including the 'save_as_new' option. Analyzing this method will help determine where the 'has_add_permission' check should be added.\n4. Additionally, the 'InlineModelAdmin' class and its 'has_add_permission' method are found, although they are not directly related to the issue at hand.\n\nFrom the analysis, it is clear that the 'has_add_permission' method exists and needs to be integrated into the 'show_save_as_new' condition within the '_changeform_view' method of the 'ModelAdmin' class.",
