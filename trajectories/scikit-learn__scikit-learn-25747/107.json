The goal is to identify where FeatureUnion handles pandas DataFrame outputs and where it integrates with custom transformers like MyTransformer. The error indicates a mismatch in expected and actual DataFrame lengths during the transformation process. Thus, it is crucial to narrow down the search to files that deal with FeatureUnion, transformer handling, and specifically, the integration of pandas-based transformations.",

When the transform output is set to 'pandas', an error occurs. This issue can be directly related to the implementation and handling of `FeatureUnion` when dealing with different types of data outputs, specifically focusing on the transition between pandas DataFrame outputs and their aggregation. The detailed error message indicates a problem with handling and merging dataframes in FeatureUnion when one expects a pandas DataFrame but gets a mismatch in indices, leading to a 'Length mismatch' error. This suggests that the relevant code spans would likely involve the methods of the `FeatureUnion` class, particularly those related to transformation handling and merging ('fit_transform', 'transform', '_hstack'). Additionally, the way `FeatureUnion` checks and validates its transformers ('_validate_transformers', '_iter') and merges feature arrays ('_hstack') would be crucial to understanding and resolving this issue. Therefore, the search task should focus on these methods to gather more context about how `FeatureUnion` deals with different output types from its transformers during the fit and transform stages.",

Additionally, the _wrap_in_pandas_container function is critical as it is responsible for wrapping data into a pandas DataFrame.
