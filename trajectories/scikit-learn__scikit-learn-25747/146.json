This suggests that the problem might be in how the FeatureUnion handles the transformation output when it's expected to be a pandas DataFrame.\n\nThe provided file context includes several spans that are relevant to understanding how FeatureUnion operates. The span 'FeatureUnion._hstack' is particularly important as it shows how the FeatureUnion class attempts to concatenate its outputs into a single array or DataFrame based on the configuration. It checks if the output should be dense ('pandas') and then uses pandas.concat if all elements are pandas DataFrames.\n\nThe new search results include the same critical span, 'FeatureUnion._hstack', which confirms that this section of code is directly related to the operation of concatenating the outputs. This method is essential for understanding how the FeatureUnion class encodes its transformation strategy and how it fails when the 'pandas' output is specified, leading to the length mismatch error.\n\nBased on the analysis, I will extract the relevant code spans from the new search results, focusing on the parts that are directly involved in the transformation and concatenation process, which seems central to the reported issue.",
