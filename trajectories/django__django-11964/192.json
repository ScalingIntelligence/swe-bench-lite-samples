The main concern is that the value returned by the getter of the field differs in type from the value initially set. Given the provided context, it's clear that the problem lies in how the value is handled in the getter method or how the choices are processed in the CharField. Therefore, we need to focus our search on the 'CharField' class in the 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' file and the 'ChoicesMeta' class in 'django/db/models/enums.py'. Additionally, we should also look into the 'ModelChoiceField' class in 'django/forms/models.py' to understand how choices are processed in forms.",

The expectation is that the value returned by the getter of the field should be of the same type as the one defined in the enum, but this is not always the case. The issue is evident in the provided test case where the string representation of the field value does not match the expected string value. To address this, we need to examine the code responsible for handling the values of these choice fields. In the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `django/db/models/enums.py` file, specifically in the `ChoicesMeta` class and its methods. These methods handle the creation and management of choices, including the mapping of values to labels, which is likely where the issue arises. The `ChoicesMeta.__new__` method is crucial as it constructs the enum class and sets the properties for each member. Additionally, the `ChoicesMeta.choices` method generates the choice tuples that are used in the model field's choices parameter, which is directly related to the reported issue. Therefore, these spans are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the type discrepancy.",
