Specifically, ManagementUtility initially determines the program name from the provided argv or sys.argv, but then uses the program name from sys.argv when parsing --pythonpath and --settings. The solution proposed in the issue is to pass self.prog_name instead of using sys.argv[0]. Analyzing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are located within the ManagementUtility class where the __init__ and execute methods are defined. The __init__ method correctly sets self.prog_name based on self.argv, however, in the execute method, CommandParser is instantiated without passing the prog argument. This aligns with the issue and suggests that the identified span in execute method (span_id='ManagementUtility.execute') is relevant for addressing the reported issue, as it shows where the self.prog_name should be passed to the CommandParser.",
