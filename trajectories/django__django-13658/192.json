The issue highlights that ManagementUtility correctly computes the prog_name from its argv, but incorrectly uses sys.argv[0] when creating a CommandParser instance. The solution involves passing self.prog_name to the CommandParser instead of relying on sys.argv[0]. Upon reviewing the search results, I found three relevant code spans:\n1. <span id='ManagementUtility'> which contains the class definition.\n2. <span id='ManagementUtility.__init__'> within the class, the __init__ method where prog_name is computed.\n3. <span id='imports'> which imports various necessary modules, including CommandParser.\nThe specific line of code within the ManagementUtility class that needs to be modified to pass self.prog_name to the CommandParser could not be located within the provided spans. However, based on the instructions to fix the issue, it is clear that modifications are needed in the ManagementUtility class, particularly in the way the CommandParser is instantiated. This should include the step to add 'prog=self.prog_name' in the CommandParser initialization parameters.",
