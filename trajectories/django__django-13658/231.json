This discrepancy needs to be resolved by ensuring that the CommandParser is instantiated with the prog parameter set to self.prog_name, thereby maintaining consistency and avoiding reliance on potentially incorrect sys.argv[0]. The provided file context and search results show the relevant parts of the code, including the ManagementUtility class definition and the __init__ method where self.prog_name is determined. To address the issue, the code that initializes CommandParser needs to be modified to use self.prog_name rather than relying on the default sys.argv[0]. This modification should take place within the ManagementUtility class, likely within a method that currently instantiates the CommandParser. However, as the actual instantiation of CommandParser is not directly provided in the context, it is recommended to search for the method or code span where CommandParser is created and adjust it according to the proposed fix.",

Instead, it should refer to self.prog_name. This can fixed as follows:\n\t\tparser = CommandParser(\n\t\t\tprog=self.prog_name,\n\t\t\tusage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',\n\t\t\tadd_help=False,\n\t\t\tallow_abbrev=False)\nI'm aware that execute_from_command_line is a private API, but it'd be really convenient for me if it worked properly in my weird embedded environment where sys.argv[0] is \u200bincorrectly None. If passing my own argv to execute_from_command_line avoided all the ensuing exceptions, I wouldn't have to modify sys.argv[0] globally as I'm doing in the meantime.\n"
