However, in subsequent method calls like `execute()`, it passes `prog='%(prog)s'` which in reality refers to `sys.argv[0]` rather than `self.prog_name`. This discrepancy can be fixed by explicitly passing the `self.prog_name` to the `CommandParser`. Given the context of already identified files and code spans, the relevant file is `django/core/management/__init__.py`. I can identify the specific area in the code where the `CommandParser` is instantiated and the need to update the instantiation parameters to use `self.prog_name` instead of defaulting to `sys.argv[0]`.",
