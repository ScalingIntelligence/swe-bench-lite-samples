Specifically, the issue points out that `ManagementUtility` correctly computes the `prog_name` from the argv it receives upon initialization but subsequently fails to use this computed `prog_name` when instantiating `CommandParser`. The current setup inadvertently uses the program name from `sys.argv` instead, which can lead to inaccuracies under certain conditions, like when `sys.argv[0]` is incorrectly set to None. The suggested fix involves passing `self.prog_name` rather than relying on `sys.argv[0]` when creating an instance of `CommandParser`.\n\nReviewing the context provided, it's clear that the relevant code spans include the `ManagementUtility` class definition and its `__init__` method, as well as the top imports where `CommandParser` is imported from `django.core.management.base`. Curiously, the part of the code where `CommandParser` is actually instantiated in reference to the issue is not shown in the provided search results, indicating perhaps a deeper dive into the `ManagementUtility` class and its methods might be required, but for now, the necessary identifying parts are present in the results.",

However, when it comes to parsing additional arguments such as --pythonpath and --settings, the class uses the program name from sys.argv rather than the self.prog_name that was previously computed. This difference can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in environments where sys.argv might be incorrect. The issue suggests that the CommandParser should be instantiated with the self.prog_name rather than relying on sys.argv[0]. I've reviewed the current file context and the new search results to identify the relevant code spans. The relevant code spans include the initialization of the ManagementUtility class and the execute method, particularly where the CommandParser is instantiated.

Instead, it should refer to self.prog_name. This can fixed as follows:\n\t\tparser = CommandParser(\n\t\t\tprog=self.prog_name,\n\t\t\tusage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',\n\t\t\tadd_help=False,\n\t\t\tallow_abbrev=False)\nI'm aware that execute_from_command_line is a private API, but it'd be really convenient for me if it worked properly in my weird embedded environment where sys.argv[0] is \u200bincorrectly None. If passing my own argv to execute_from_command_line avoided all the ensuing exceptions, I wouldn't have to modify sys.argv[0] globally as I'm doing in the meantime.\n"
