This issue is particularly relevant in embedded environments where sys.argv[0] might be incorrectly set to None. The search results provide the necessary context to address this issue. The ManagementUtility class is found within the django/core/management/__init__.py file, and it contains the __init__ method where self.prog_name is set. Additionally, the execute_from_command_line function instantiates ManagementUtility and calls its execute method. The relevant code spans include the imports section for context, the definition of the ManagementUtility class, the __init__ method where self.prog_name is defined, and the execute_from_command_line function. These code spans collectively illustrate where the adjustment needs to be made to ensure that self.prog_name is used instead of sys.argv[0] in the CommandParser instantiation.",
