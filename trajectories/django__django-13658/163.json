Instead, it should refer to self.prog_name. This can fixed as follows:\n\t\tparser = CommandParser(\n\t\t\tprog=self.prog_name,\n\t\t\tusage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',\n\t\t\tadd_help=False,\n\t\t\tallow_abbrev=False)\nI'm aware that execute_from_command_line is a private API, but it'd be really convenient for me if it worked properly in my weird embedded environment where sys.argv[0] is \u200bincorrectly None. If passing my own argv to execute_from_command_line avoided all the ensuing exceptions, I wouldn't have to modify sys.argv[0] globally as I'm doing in the meantime.\n"
