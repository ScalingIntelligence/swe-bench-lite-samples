The current implementation of `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value` does not take into account the user's email, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if tokens are validated against outdated user data. Therefore, the immediate requirement is to modify this method to include the user's email address within the hash value calculation. This would ensure that any change in email triggers an invalidation of existing tokens. The provided code segment from `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py` contains the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class, particularly the `_make_hash_value` method which currently only includes user primary key, password, last login timestamp, and current timestamp. This method is highly relevant for a fix since altering it to incorporate the 'email' attribute will resolve the issue. Consequently, the identified span of code is pertinent to the issue and should be modified to integrate the email attribute into the hash value generation process.",
