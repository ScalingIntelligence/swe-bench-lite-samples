This points to a critical flaw in the token generation and validation logic, specifically in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value()` method. The solution involves including the user's email address in the hash value computation to ensure that tokens are invalidated upon email change.\n\nGiven the context provided, the focus should be on the `_make_hash_value` method within the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class. We should also ensure that any modifications to the user model, particularly related to the email field, and the token generation process are properly handled.\n\nTo address this, we need to: \n1. Identify where the `_make_hash_value` method is defined. \n2. Evaluate the potential impact on other parts of the system that generate or use password reset tokens.\n3. Ensure that any related methods, such as token checking and generating methods, are also examined or updated as necessary.",

Given the vulnerability detailed in the issue, the email address should be included in `_make_hash_value` to ensure tokens are invalidated upon email change. Therefore, the relevant code for addressing the issue is present, but it requires an additional modification.
