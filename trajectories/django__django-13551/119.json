This will ensure that if a user changes their email, any pending password reset tokens will be rendered invalid. Keeping the token generation logic within the model, similar to `get_session_auth_hash()`, could also be beneficial for future extensibility.",

The core logic for token generation and validation lies in the PasswordResetTokenGenerator class in the django/contrib/auth/tokens.py file. Specifically, the method _make_hash_value() is responsible for creating the hash value used in token generation, which currently does not incorporate the user's email address. Including the email address in this method would likely address the issue by making tokens tied to the current email address of the user. Additionally, the AbstractBaseUser class in django/contrib/auth/base_user.py provides the base functionality for user models but does not currently enforce email handling within token generation. Enhancing the PasswordResetTokenGenerator to include email could align with the method get_session_auth_hash() which uses the user's password to generate a hash, suggesting a similar approach for email might be appropriate. Therefore, the relevant code spans to focus on are within the PasswordResetTokenGenerator class, particularly the _make_hash_value() method, to modify it to include the email address.",
