Specifically, the challenge lies in ensuring that the PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value method includes the user's email address in its hash calculation. This approach will help in making sure that any change in the user's email address is reflected in the token's hash value, thus preventing the token from being used after the email address has been changed. To implement this fix, the relevant method to focus on is PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value. This method should be modified to include the user's email address in the hash calculation. Additionally, the approach to solve this problem could be extended to other parts of the authentication system where the user's email address plays a critical role in validation or token generation. By factoring out token generation methods or leveraging model-specific functions like get_session_auth_hash(), we can ensure that all tokens and sessions are appropriately invalidated upon critical changes like email address updates.",
