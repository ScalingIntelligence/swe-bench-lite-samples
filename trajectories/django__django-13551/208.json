If not, this method needs to be modified to include the email address to ensure tokens are invalidated upon email change. Additionally, the `AbstractBaseUser` class should be examined to ensure it doesn't inherently forbid having an email address, which could affect how tokens are managed for such users. The `_make_hash_value` method currently includes the user's primary key, password, last login time, and timestamp, which are relevant elements for token generation. However, it does not currently include the email address.

These spans are directly related to the functionality of password reset, which could be indirectly affected if the token generation logic changes.\n\nTwo primary spans relate directly to implementing the fix: the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value` method and possibly adjusting references within forms such as `PasswordResetForm` if token generation logic is moved or modified.
