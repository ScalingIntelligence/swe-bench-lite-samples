Additionally, in `matrices.py`, the `MatrixBase._handle_creation_inputs` method also appears relevant because it handles the creation of matrices including those from `BlockDiagMatrix`. I am choosing the code spans from these files: `BlockDiagMatrix._entry` in `matrix/expressions/blockmatrix.py` and `MatrixBase._handle_creation_inputs` in `matrices.py` as they directly relate to the issue and could be where the conversion problem originates or is handled.",
