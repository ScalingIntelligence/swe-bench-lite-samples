The error traceback indicates that the problem arises when trying to access an entry in the BlockDiagMatrix. Specifically, the error 'One' object is not subscriptable suggests that there might be an issue with how the matrix entry is being accessed or handled when there is only one block in the BlockDiagMatrix. The search results provide the relevant code for the BlockMatrix class, particularly the _entry method, which is central to accessing entries in the matrix. This method is crucial for understanding how the matrix elements are being accessed and where the conversion process might be failing. Based on the issue description and the code analysis, it is evident that the _entry method is directly involved in the error, making it a highly relevant piece of code for addressing the problem.
