In particular, the '__new__' method of BlockDiagMatrix suggests how instances of this class are created, which is directly relevant to the issue. The 'shape', 'rowblocksizes', and '_eval_transpose' methods provide insights into how the properties of these matrices are determined, which could be related to the conversion error. The '_blockadd' method, though not directly causing the issue, gives context on how block matrices are manipulated, offering a fuller understanding of the class's functionalities.

The issue does not occur when the BlockDiagMatrix has two elements, indicating a potential edge case or bug in the handling of single-element BlockDiagMatrices.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified in the current file context and the new search results primarily focus on the BlockDiagMatrix class, particularly the '_entry' method in the BlockMatrix class which is likely where the error is occurring when trying to access an element from a BlockDiagMatrix. The '_entry' method is responsible for fetching entries from the block matrix, and the error indicates that at some point, an attempt is made to subscript a 'One' object, which is not allowed.\n\nThe search results confirmed the presence of the '_entry' method in the BlockMatrix class, which is crucial for understanding how elements are accessed within a block matrix. Additionally, the search results include the 'as_explicit' method in the OneMatrix class, which could be relevant if the 'One' object is involved in the conversion process.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant files and code spans are 'sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py' for BlockMatrix and BlockDiagMatrix classes, particularly the '_entry' method, and 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' for the MatrixExpr class and its 'as_explicit' method, especially as it relates to the OneMatrix class.",
