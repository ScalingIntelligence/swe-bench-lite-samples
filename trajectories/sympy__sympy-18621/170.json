The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the BlockDiagMatrix class, specifically in the _entry method where it tries to access an element using self.blocks. This suggests that the behavior of BlockDiagMatrix when it has only one element is not correctly handled in this method. The search results provide several relevant spans of code in the `blockmatrix.py` file, particularly the `BlockMatrix._entry` and `BlockDiagMatrix` class methods. These are directly related to the issue as they involve the handling and structure of BlockDiagMatrix objects. Notably, the `BlockMatrix._entry` method is the one that contains the logic for accessing elements in the matrix, which is where the error occurs as per the traceback. Additionally, the `BlockDiagMatrix.__new__` method and others like `_eval_inverse`, `_eval_transpose`, `_blockmul`, and `_blockadd` are also relevant as they pertain to the creation and manipulation of BlockDiagMatrix objects, which could be reached by following the possible neds to modify _entry. These methods might need to be adjusted or further examined in relation to the single-element scenario to resolve the issue.",
