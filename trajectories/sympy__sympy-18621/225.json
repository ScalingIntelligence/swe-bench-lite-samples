This issue does not occur when the BlockDiagMatrix contains more than one element. I have examined the provided search results in the context of the BlockDiagMatrix class in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py'. The main relevance here is how the BlockDiagMatrix class handles single and multiple block elements. Specifically, the '__new__' method, the 'shape' property, and '_blockadd' method are likely points of interest. The '__new__' method initializes the BlockDiagMatrix object, the 'shape' property computes the shape of the matrix, and '_blockadd' handles the addition of block matrices. These methods and properties should be reviewed to identify if they correctly handle single-block scenarios. Given the nature of the reported issue, focusing on these areas should help in diagnosing why a single-element BlockDiagMatrix cannot be converted to a regular Matrix.",
