This issue does not occur when there are two elements in the BlockDiagMatrix. The traceback points to the '_entry' method in the 'blockmatrix.py' file and the '__getitem__' method in the 'matexpr.py' file, where the error might be occurring. In the search results, we have several relevant spans:\n\n1. 'BlockMatrix._entry' in 'blockmatrix.py': This method is responsible for retrieving entries from the BlockMatrix, which is likely where the TypeError occurs.\n2. 'MatrixExpr.__getitem__' in 'matexpr.py': This method handles indexing, and it calls '_entry' on the MatrixExpr instance.\n3. 'BlockDiagMatrix' in 'blockmatrix.py': This class is central to the issue as it is the one that fails to convert correctly when it has only one element.\n\nThe identified spans seem relevant to the reported issue. However, I did not find any specific check or handling for BlockDiagMatrix instances with only one element in the results, which might explain the error. Further investigation or a similar search in other parts of the codebase might be needed to identify how `Instances with only one element in the results, I have selected the spans that directly relate to the reported issue.
