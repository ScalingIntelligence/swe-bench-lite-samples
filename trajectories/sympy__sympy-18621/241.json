The provided traceback indicates an error related to the 'One' object not being subscriptable in the BlockMatrix class. To address this, we need to identify sections of code within the BlockMatrix and BlockDiagMatrix classes that handle this conversion and potentially manage 'One' objects. Looking at the search results, several spans within sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py appear relevant as they deal with BlockDiagMatrix instantiation, properties, and methods involved in matrix operations. Notably, the spans dealing with BlockDiagMatrix's blocks, shape, and inverse properties, as well as the evaluation of inverse and transpose methods, could be relevant. However, the specific issue of a 'One' object not being subscriptable suggests further that we need to inspect where 'One' objects are handled or returned in the BlockMatrix class",
