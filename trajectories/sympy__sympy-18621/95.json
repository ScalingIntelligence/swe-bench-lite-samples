The provided search results focus on the sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py file, which contains the BlockDiagMatrix class. This class is critical for understanding how block diagonal matrices are created and managed within SymPy. Specifically, reviewing the `shape` property reveals how the overall dimensions of the BlockDiagMatrix are calculated by summing the rows and columns of individual blocks. Given the error traceback in the issue description, the `TypeError: 'One' object is not subscriptable` suggests there's a problem when accessing elements of the BlockDiagMatrix if it contains only one block. Therefore, the `shape` property and the `BlockDiagMatrix` class are likely central to the issue. Additionally, the error is encountered when using the `as_explicit` method from matexpr.py, which is not directly included in the provided search results but should be noted for a comprehensive review if more results are needed. For now, focusing on the `shape` property and the initialization of `BlockDiagMatrix` in the blockmatrix.py file seems most relevant.",
