The error occurs specifically when trying to access elements of the BlockDiagMatrix, indicating a problem with how single-element BlockDiagMatrices are handled. Since the error traces back to an operation in BlockDiagMatrix, investigating the BlockDiagMatrix class and its methods, particularly those related to element access and conversion, should be the focus. Given the file context, the BlockDiagMatrix class is defined in sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py, and the error involves accessing elements, so searching within this file for the BlockDiagMatrix class and its methods is a logical initial step. Further, the error message suggests an issue with 'One' objects not being subscriptable, so checking for the interaction between BlockDiagMatrix and OneMatrix might provide more insights. Since the functionality works with multiple elements, examining the differences in behavior between single and multiple element setups would be beneficial.",
