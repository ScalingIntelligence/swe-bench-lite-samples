From the search results, we have identified two relevant code spans. In `django/utils/text.py`, the `slugify` function is defined, which is likely the primary target for modification to address the issue. The current implementation of the `slugify` function uses regular expressions to replace non-word characters and multiple spaces with a single dash. However, it does not specifically handle leading or trailing dashes and underscores, which is the core requirement of the issue. The second code span in `django/template/defaultfilters.py` references the `slugify` function but does not directly contribute to the solution of the issue since it is a template filter that internally calls the main `slugify` function in `text.py`. Based on this analysis, the main focus should be on modifying the `slugify` function in `django/utils/text.py` to address the leading and trailing dash and underscore issue.",

Currently, the function converts a string to a slug by removing special characters and replacing spaces and hyphens with a single hyphen. However, it does not remove leading or trailing hyphens or underscores. The existing implementation can be found in the 'slugify' span within the 'django/utils/text.py' file. To address the issue, modifications will be needed in this function to ensure that leading and trailing hyphens and underscores are removed.
