The specific concern is with a section of code in `fitsrec.py` where it is suspected that an in-place replacement is incorrectly attempted, which could be incorrect since `replace` does not modify the `chararray` in place. This problem involves understanding the behavior of the `replace` method in the context of `chararray` and ensuring that any modifications are properly applied. The provided search results include a section of code within the `FITS_rec` class, specifically in the `_scale_back_ascii` method. This method contains the exact snippet of code that the issue refers to, which suggests there is a potential bug in how 'D' exponents are handled. The presence of this code in the search results directly aligns with the reported issue. Additionally, the absence of tests failing when this code is commented out indicates that there might not be adequate test coverage for this specific functionality, as noted in the issue. Therefore, the search results are relevant to the reported issue, confirming the location of the potential bug.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
