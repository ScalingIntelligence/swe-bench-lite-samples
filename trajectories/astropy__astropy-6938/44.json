The issue also states that commenting out the code doesn't cause any tests to fail, implying that this functionality might not be adequately tested. To investigate this further, focus on searching for related functionality or similar patterns in the `fitsrec.py` file and other relevant files that handle data conversions or ASCII scaling. Additionally, look for tests or usage examples that might illuminate how this code is intended to work or should be corrected.",

Specifically, the issue involves a code snippet in 'fitsrec.py' where the 'replace' method is used on a 'chararray', and it is suspected that this operation might not be in-place as intended. The commenter also mentions that removing this code does not cause any tests to fail, suggesting that it may not be adequately tested.\n\nThe task is to identify relevant code spans within the provided search results that address this issue. The initial focus is on 'astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py', where the code snippet provided in the issue is located. The spans of code in this file include various methods and classes related to handling FITS records and ASCII conversion. The 'FITS_rec._convert_ascii' method seems particularly relevant, as it directly deals with converting ASCII fields and includes the line modifying the 'D' exponent.\n\nBased on the context provided and the relevance to the issue, the 'FITS_rec._convert_ascii' section is identified as relevant. This section includes the code that modifies the 'D' exponent, which is the focus of the reported issue.",
