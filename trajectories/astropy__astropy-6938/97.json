Hence, the focus should be on finding any code related to floating point number formatting and the handling of 'D' exponents in the context of `fitsrec.py`.",

Specifically, the code snippet mentioned in the issue is within the `_scale_back_ascii` method of the `FITS_rec` class. This method appears to be responsible for transforming input fields into ASCII-formatted output fields, which is relevant to the issue of handling 'D' exponents correctly. The key code block in question is:\n\n```python\nif 'D' in format:\n    output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\n```\n\nThe issue raises concerns about the method `replace` not being an in-place operation, which implies that it returns a copy rather than modifying `output_field` directly.

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
