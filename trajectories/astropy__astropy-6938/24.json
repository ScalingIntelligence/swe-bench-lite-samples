The specific code in question is `output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))` in `fitsrec.py`. This code may not work as intended because `replace` is not an in-place operation for `chararray`. Additionally, commenting out this code does not cause any tests to fail, indicating that this code may not be adequately tested. To confirm this, we should focus our search on `fitsrec.py` specifically around the `_convert_ascii` method as it is likely related to handling ASCII fields and potentially floating point numbers with 'D' exponent. It's also worth checking other relevant files such as `column.py`, `card.py`, and `table.py`, which might contain related code or tests.",
