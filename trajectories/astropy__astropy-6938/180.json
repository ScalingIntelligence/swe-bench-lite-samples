The provided search results include a segment of code from `fitsrec.py`, which precisely contains the identified problematic line. This line is within the method `_scale_back_ascii`, which processes ASCII fields and includes the handling of formats containing 'D'. The presence of this segment in the search results strongly suggests that it is relevant to the reported issue, especially since it encompasses the code in question and its surrounding context. The surrounding code ensures a comprehensive view, confirming that this segment is indeed relevant to the issue. Thus, I will mark this segment as relevant to the reported issue.

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
