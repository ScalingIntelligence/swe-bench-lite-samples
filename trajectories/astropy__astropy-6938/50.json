The fix suggested is to ensure that the `replace` operation is correctly applied without causing an in-place mutation. Additionally, the issue implies that this code might not be adequately tested, suggesting a need to investigate test coverage. The files provided in the context suggest related code spans in `fitsrec.py`, `card.py`, `table.py`, and others. These files deal with various aspects of FITS file handling and data formatting, which could be relevant to the issue. Given the code snippet, it's crucial to focus on the `_scale_back_ascii` method in `fitsrec.py` and ensure that similar operations are correctly handled in related files. Test files are outside the scope, aligning with the need to focus on operational code.",

This is further supported by the fact that commenting out the code doesn't cause any tests to fail, suggesting it may not be properly tested.\n\nGiven the context provided and the specific issue mentioned, the relevant code span to be examined is the function `_scale_back_ascii` in the `fitsrec.py` file of the `astropy/io/fits` module. This function contains the code that checks for the presence of 'D' in the format and attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' using the `replace` method on `output_field`. This exact line of code is the focus of the reported issue, making the identified span directly relevant to the problem described.\n\nTherefore, based on the reported issue and the provided search results, the relevant code span is the function `_scale_back_ascii` which includes the specific line of code that needs to be corrected or reviewed.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
