Since commenting out this code does not cause any tests to fail, this issue likely falls under the integration or system testing category and can be considered a call for more comprehensive tests. Given these observations, I'll start by searching for the exact code snippet in the relevant Python files to pinpoint the presence of this bug.",

Specifically, the concern is with the code snippet where the `replace` method is used on a `chararray`. The issue states that `replace` is not an in-place operation for `chararray`, suggesting that it returns a copy rather than modifying the original array. This could lead to the original array not being updated as intended. Additionally, the code appears to be untested as no tests fail when it is commented out. The provided search results include the `fitsrec.py` file, and within this file, the relevant code span is identified as the `_scale_back_ascii` method where the problematic line is located. Thus, this search result directly relates to the reported issue, confirming the presence of the code in question and allowing for an assessment of its correctness or potential bugs.",
