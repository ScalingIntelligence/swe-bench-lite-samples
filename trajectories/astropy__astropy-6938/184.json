The issue identified is that the 'replace' method used on the 'output_field' might not be in-place, which could lead to the incorrect replacement of 'E' with 'D'. Furthermore, the lack of failing tests upon commenting out this code suggests that there might not be adequate testing around this functionality.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, the relevant code span includes the specific section of the _scale_back_ascii method where the concern about 'D' exponents is addressed. This section contains the code that attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in the 'output_field'. Therefore, this code span is directly relevant to the reported issue as it deals with the exact problem and its potential incorrect implementation.\n\nGiven the relevance of this code span to the reported issue and the immediate context provided, this seems to be the only part of the codebase that deals directly with this specific functionality.
