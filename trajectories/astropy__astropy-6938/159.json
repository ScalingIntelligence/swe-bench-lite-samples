The code is located in `fitsrec.py`, specifically in the `_scale_back_ascii` method. Although the code context shows that the method is defined, it does not show the exact line where the problematic code resides. To verify and possibly fix the issue, it's crucial to locate the exact code snippet that needs to be corrected or tested. Additionally, since commenting out the code didn't cause any tests to fail, it suggests that there might be a lack of adequate test coverage for this part of the code. Therefore, it would be helpful to also find any test files related to this functionality.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
