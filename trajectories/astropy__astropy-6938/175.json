The code snippet provided in the issue matches exactly with the code span identified in the search results under the 'FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii' span. This code span contains the specific line of code: 'if 'D' in format: output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))', which is the focus of the reported issue. This line appears to incorrectly use the `.replace()` method on a `chararray`, which does not modify the array in place but returns a copy. Given the direct alignment of the identified code span with the issue, this span is judged to be highly relevant. Additionally, as the issue indicates that no tests fail when this code is commented out, it suggests that this part of the code may not be adequately tested, which further supports the relevance of this finding to the reported issue.",

The specific concern is with the following code snippet:\n\n```python\nif 'D' in format:\n    output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\n```\n\nThe issue identified is that `replace` is not an in-place operation for `chararray`, meaning it returns a copy rather than modifying the original array. This could lead to the original array not being updated as expected. Additionally, there are no tests that fail upon commenting out this code, suggesting that the code may not be adequately tested.\n\nThe initial file context provided includes `fitsrec.py` with a specific method, `_scale_back_ascii`, which contains the problematic code. The search results yield a more comprehensive view of the `FITS_rec` class, its methods, and properties. Notably, several spans mention 'format', which is relevant to the issue, as well as spans specifically dealing with 'D' in the context of formats (e.g., `_convert_ascii`). These spans could contain additional insights into how formats, including those with 'D', are handled.\n\nGiven this context, the identified spans from the search results are relevant as they pertain to the handling of formats and conversions, which are directly related to the reported issue. Evaluating these spans carefully can help in diagnosing the problem and identifying potential fixes or tests that need to be implemented.\n",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
