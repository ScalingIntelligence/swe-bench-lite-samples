The specific code in question involves a `replace` operation on a `chararray`, which is likely not being executed as intended due to the non-in-place nature of the `replace` method. This function is located within the `_scale_back_ascii` method of the `FITS_rec` class. Given that this method directly deals with formatting and scaling of ASCII fields, including the handling of different formats such as 'D', it is crucial to ensure that any mutation operations are correctly applied. Since the code snippet provided matches the description in the issue, it is identified as highly relevant. The presence of this code in the search results implies that further review or modification might be necessary to ensure the intended functionality.

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
