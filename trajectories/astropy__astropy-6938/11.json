The search results provided contain the `_scale_back_ascii` method within the `FITS_rec` class in the `fitsrec.py` file, which includes the exact code snippet in question. This part of the code checks if the format contains 'D' and attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in the `output_field`. Given that this is the exact segment of code identified as potentially buggy in the reported issue and is found in the file `fitsrec.py`, it is highly relevant and should be addressed.
