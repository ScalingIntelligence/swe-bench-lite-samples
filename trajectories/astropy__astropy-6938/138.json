The specific concern is that the `replace` method is not being used correctly, as it returns a copy rather than modifying the array in place. This is evidenced in the code snippet provided where `output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))` is likely not having the intended effect. Given the context and the reference to the `fitsrec.py` file, the key area to examine is the `_scale_back_ascii` method which contains this line of code. The method deals with scaling back ASCII fields and formats, which directly relates to the formatting of floating point numbers. Therefore, the relevant code span is the one containing this method, specifically where the 'D' format character is checked. This aligns with the reported issue, making this section of the code highly relevant.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
