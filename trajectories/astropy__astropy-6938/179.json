The code snippet provided indicates an issue with how the `replace` method is being used, as it appears to be treating it as an in-place operation rather than using the returned copy. The code should be checked to ensure it correctly handles the replacement and that it is actually doing what it intends to do. Since commenting out the code doesn't cause any tests to fail, it also suggests that proper testing for this feature may be lacking. Given the nature of the issue, focusing the search on the `fitsrec.py` file and specifically on instances where the `replace` method is used on a `chararray`, as well as looking for any related test cases that may not be robust enough, would be a good starting point.",

The specific concern is that the `replace` method used in the code snippet does not perform an in-place operation and thus may not actually modify the `output_field` as intended. This issue is located within the `_scale_back_ascii` method of the `FITS_rec` class. Upon reviewing the provided `search_results`, the relevant code spans include the entire `_scale_back_ascii` method which contains the problematic line of code. Additional parts of the code that initialize columns and handle formats within the `FITS_rec` class may be indirectly relevant for understanding the context in which this bug occurs.\n\nThe analysis shows that the identified code span in `FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii` directly addresses the reported issue by containing the code that needs to be fixed. Additionally, the context provided by the other methods in the `FITS_rec` class, such as `__init__` and `from_columns`, gives insight into the overall structure and behavior of the class, which may be helpful in understanding and addressing the bug.
