The issue highlights that the `replace` method may not be functioning as intended due to not being in-place, potentially due to the use of `chararray`. I analyzed the provided code spans in `fitsrec.py` and identified two relevant spans: 'FITS_rec._convert_ascii' and 'FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii'. Both of these spans deal with the conversion of ASCII fields, which aligns with the reported issue concerning 'D' exponents. Additionally, the function `encode_ascii` in `util.py` is relevant as it is used to handle ASCII encoding, which might be required to fix the reported issue. However, the initial code snippet provided in the issue specifically points to `fitsrec.py`, so 'util.py' is considered secondary context. The 'FITS_rec._convert_ascii' span is most directly related to the reported issue, as it contains the specific code where the 'D' exponent is being replaced. The 'FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii' span provides additional context for handling ASCII fields.",
