The specific code snippet provided indicates that the replacement operation might not be in-place as intended, which could be a source of the issue. The analysis also points out that there are no tests failing when this code is commented out, suggesting that this functionality might not be adequately covered by tests. Given the complexity and interdependence of different components like `chararray`, it's crucial to verify if other parts of the code might be inadvertently handling this in a manner that compensates for this issue. As a first step, we can search for the specific function or method where this replacement operation is used.",

The issue mentions that commenting out the code does not cause any tests to fail, suggesting that this code might not be tested. The search results provided include the relevant section of the `fitsrec.py` file where the problematic code is found, specifically within the `_scale_back_ascii` method of the `FITS_rec` class. This method is responsible for handling the scaling back of ASCII fields, and the problematic line is where 'D' in format triggers a replacement of 'E' with 'D'. The provided snippet is relevant to the issue as it directly addresses the area of concern.
