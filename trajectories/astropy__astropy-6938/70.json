The issue highlights that the 'replace' method used on 'output_field' does not modify the array in place and returns a copy instead. This could lead to the code not functioning as intended. Upon reviewing the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are all located within the 'fitsrec.py' file, specifically within the 'FITS_record' and 'FITS_rec' classes. The crucial span is 'FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii', which contains the exact code snippet reported to be potentially incorrect. This span should be the main focus of any corrections or further investigation. The other spans within 'FITS_rec' provide more context about the class and its functionalities, but the immediate issue pertains solely to the 'FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii' method.

The search results provided additional context on how other parts of the codebase handle float formatting and exponents which could be relevant for understanding the broader context or potential fixes. The relevant span 'FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii' in 'astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py' aligns with the issue as it deals with format handling and replacement of exponential characters. Additionally, exploring other files like 'astropy/units/format/cds.py' and 'astropy/io/votable/converters.py' provides insight into how exponents are handled in different contexts, possibly guiding a fix or enhancement for the issue in 'fitsrec.py'.
