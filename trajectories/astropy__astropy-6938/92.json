The reported code snippet suggests that the `replace` method is being used incorrectly on a `chararray`, as it returns a copy rather than performing an in-place operation. This might explain why commenting out this code doesn't affect any tests. The search results provide the full context of the FITS_rec class, which includes methods like `_convert_ascii` that handle the conversion of ASCII columns, particularly focusing on handling the 'D' exponent. Here, the code uses `np.char.replace` which correctly returns a modified copy rather than an in-place operation, aligning with the expected behavior noted in the issue. The relevant code span is therefore the `_convert_ascii` method within the FITS_rec class.",
