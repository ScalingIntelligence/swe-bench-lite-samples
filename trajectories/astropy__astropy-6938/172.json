To address this, we should find all occurrences of such 'D' exponent handling in the `fitsrec.py` file and potentially other related files.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue in `io.fits` concerns a potential bug related to the handling of 'D' exponents in floating-point numbers within the `fitsrec.py` module. Specifically, the code in question involves a `replace` method that might not be working as expected due to returning a copy instead of modifying the array in place. Since the reported code is in `fitsrec.py`, it is essential to first confirm the existence of this code segment in the provided search results and then check the surrounding code for any additional relevant logic pertaining to floating-point number formatting or exponent handling.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, the relevant code snippet from `fitsrec.py` is located in the `FITS_rec` class method `_convert_ascii`, where the `replace` operation is performed. Additionally, related functions such as `_format_float` in `card.py` and other parts of the codebase that deal with float formatting, specifically exponents, should be reviewed. The `_format_float` function in `card.py` specifically formats floating-point numbers and handles the exponent part, which makes it directly relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nOther potentially relevant sections include `CompImageHDU` in `compressed.py`, which deals with compressed image data and might handle floating-point data similarly. It is also worth noting the `table_to_hdu` function in `convenience.py`, which converts tables to HDUs and could indirectly relate to floating-point data handling if tables contain such data types.\n\nConsidering the initial file and the specific issue reported, the search task is focused on identifying and extracting code spans from the search results that either directly pertain to the `replace` method issue or relate to floating-point format handling, especially concerning the formatting of 'E' and 'D' exponents. Thus, priority is given to code spans such as `FITS_rec._convert_ascii` in `fitsrec.py` and `_format_float` in `card.py`.",
