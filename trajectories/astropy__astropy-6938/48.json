The specific line of concern is `output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))`, which may not be correctly modifying `output_field` due to the nature of `chararray`'s `replace` method, which returns a copy of the array rather than modifying it in place. Given this context, the immediate focus should be on the `_scale_back` function in `fitsrec.py`, which might contain the relevant code for handling exponent replacement. Additionally, considering that the `fitsrec.py` file contains several related functions, it would be prudent to ensure all functions involved in data scaling and type conversion are examined.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
