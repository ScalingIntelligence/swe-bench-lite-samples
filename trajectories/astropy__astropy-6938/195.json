            "scratch_pad": "1. The reported issue is related to the handling of 'D' exponents in floating-point numbers in the `fitsrec.py` file. The specific code snippet provided indicates a potential bug where the `replace` method is used on a `chararray`, which returns a copy rather than modifying the array in place. This needs to be verified and possibly corrected.\n\n2. The current file context shows the `fitsrec.py` file and includes the `FITS_rec` class with the `_scale_back_ascii` method where the problematic code resides. This method is directly related to ASCII table scaling back operations, which may involve handling of floating-point formats like 'D'.\n\n3. Reviewing the new search results, several files and code spans are provided:\n   - `table.py` with `BinTableHDU` class: Relevant for binary table operations but doesn't directly address the exponent issue.\n   - `card.py`, `compressed.py`, `util.py`, `image.py`, and `column.py`: These files include utility functions and classes related to various aspects of FITS operations but are not immediately relevant to the 'D' exponent handling bug.\n   - `fitsrec.py` with additional spans: This file contains more of the `FITS_rec` class methods, including `_convert_ascii`, `_convert_other`, `_get_scale_factors`, `_scale_back`, and the continuation of `_scale_back_ascii`.\n\n4. Analyzing the `fitsrec.py` file further, particularly the `_scale_back_ascii` and `_scale_back` methods, reveals more context about how the format and scaling operations are handled. The `_scale_back_ascii` method is crucial as it directly manipulates the output field based on the format, including the handling of 'D' exponents. The `_scale_back` method also provides insight into overall scaling operations, potentially affecting how 'D' exponent values are treated.\n\n5. Based on the analysis, the identified code spans in the `fitsrec.py` file are most relevant to the reported issue. These spans encompass the areas where the 'D' exponent substitution occurs and where the overall scaling operations are defined. They provide the necessary context to understand and potentially fix the identified bug.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
