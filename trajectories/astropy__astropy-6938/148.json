The specific concern is with the use of the 'replace' method in the 'fitsrec.py' file, where it's suspected that the method is not being used correctly because it returns a copy rather than performing an in-place operation. The code provided in the search results contains relevant sections from 'fitsrec.py', including a method '_convert_ascii' that uses 'np.char.replace' to change 'D' to 'E'. This method is crucial for understanding how ASCII data is converted, especially since it directly addresses the 'D' exponent issue. Additionally, the '_scale_back_ascii' method, which contains the suspected problematic line, is also found in the search results. Both methods are relevant to the issue as they handle ASCII conversions and scaling back operations, key processes when dealing with floating-point numbers and their formatting. Therefore, these methods and the lines within them are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
