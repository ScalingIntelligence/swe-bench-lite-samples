The relevant code is present in the file context, specifically in the `_scale_back_ascii` function of `FITS_rec` class, where `output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))` is used. The presence of this code snippet confirms that the problematic usage of `chararray.replace` is indeed present in the file context. To complete the assessment, reviewing NumPy's `chararray` class for insights into the `replace` method's functionality would be beneficial.
