Specifically, the code in question is in `fitsrec.py` and includes a piece of code that attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in a floating-point number representation. The issue is that the `replace` method on `chararray` is not in-place, meaning it returns a copy rather than modifying the original array. This could lead to the modification not taking effect as intended. The provided search results contain the relevant code in the `_scale_back_ascii` method of the `FITS_rec` class. The method handles formatting and scaling of ASCII fields, which includes the problematic line of code. This section of the code is directly related to the reported issue as it contains the code that attempts to handle 'D' exponents using the `replace` method, which is suspected to be incorrect. Therefore, the identified code span includes the entire method to ensure a complete context around the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Possible bug in io.fits related to D exponents\nI came across the following code in ``fitsrec.py``:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers\r\n        if 'D' in format:\r\n            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this may be incorrect because as far as I can tell ``replace`` is not an in-place operation for ``chararray`` (it returns a copy). Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
