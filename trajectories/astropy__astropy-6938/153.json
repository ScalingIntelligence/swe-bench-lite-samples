The snippet of code provided in the issue is the suspected buggy part within the file `fitsrec.py`. Upon reviewing the search results, I find a similar block of code within the same file and class `FITS_rec`, specifically in the method `_scale_back_ascii`. The key part of the code in question, which attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in the format, is also present in the search results. This confirms that the search result is relevant to the reported issue since it contains the exact code span where the potential bug exists. Commenting out or fixing this part could be the solution to the described issue. It's also noted that no tests seem to cover this section, which aligns with the reporter's observation that removing this code does not affect any tests.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the identified span of code in `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` that matches the reported issue is inside the class `FITS_rec` and specifically within the method `_scale_back_ascii` where the line attempting to replace 'E' with 'D' is located.",
