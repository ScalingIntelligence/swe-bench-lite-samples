Additionally, there are concerns that this code might not be adequately tested, as commenting it out does not cause any tests to fail. Upon examining the search results, it is clear that the identified code span in `fitsrec.py` directly corresponds to the mentioned bug. The method `_scale_back_ascii` contains the problematic line of code where the `replace` operation is used improperly.
