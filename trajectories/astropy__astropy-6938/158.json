The code snippet provided in the issue matches a specific method in the `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` file within the `_scale_back_ascii` method of the `FITS_rec` class. This method includes a section of code where the exponent separator 'E' is attempted to be replaced with 'D'. The issue suggests that this operation might be incorrect because the `replace` method for `chararray` does not perform an in-place operation, and the method returns a copy. Additionally, commenting out this code did not affect any tests, indicating that this part of the code might not be adequately tested. Given this context, the relevant code spans seem to be centered around the section where the exponent replacement logic is implemented within the `_scale_back_ascii` method. Therefore, focusing on this method in the `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` file is essential for addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Possible bug in io.fits related to D exponents\nI came across the following code in ``fitsrec.py``:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers\r\n        if 'D' in format:\r\n            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this may be incorrect because as far as I can tell ``replace`` is not an in-place operation for ``chararray`` (it returns a copy). Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
