The specific line of concern is:\n\n```python\nif 'D' in format:\n    output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\n```\n\nThis line is indeed within the '_scale_back_ascii' method and is directly related to handling 'D' exponents.

Additionally, since commenting out this code does not affect any tests, this also aligns with the issue's concern about untested functionality.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns a potential bug in the `fitsrec.py` file related to the handling of 'D' exponents in floating point numbers. Specifically, the issue points out that the `replace` method is not an in-place operation for `chararray`, thus suggesting that the current implementation might not be functioning as intended. The provided code in the `fitsrec.py` file includes a method `_scale_back_ascii` where the problematic code block is located. This method deals with formatting and scaling of ASCII fields in FITS records. The key part of the code to focus on is the section where the 'D' exponent is replaced with 'E'. The context provided in the `file_context` confirms the presence of this code block within the `FITS_rec` class, specifically in the `_scale_back_ascii` method. The analysis of the new search results reveals that while there is a relevant method `_scale_back_ascii` with the problematic code, there are other methods in the `FITS_rec` class that handle various aspects of data formatting and scaling. These could potentially be affected by or relevant to the issue due to their involvement with data handling and scaling in the context of FITS records. The methods `_scale_back`, `_convert_other`, and others related to column definitions and data conversions are also relevant as they might interact with or be affected by the issue in question. By examining these additional methods, we can ensure a comprehensive understanding of the codebase's handling of data related to the reported issue.",
