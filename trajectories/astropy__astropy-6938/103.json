The specific snippet of code in question is located in the `fitsrec.py` file within the `_scale_back_ascii` method of the `FITS_rec` class. The issue points out that the `output_field.replace()` method call might be incorrect because `replace` for `chararray` does not perform an in-place operation; it returns a copy instead. Additionally, the code does not appear to be covered by any tests. Upon reviewing the provided search results, the exact code snippet identified in the issue is found within the `_scale_back_ascii` method. This confirms that the search results contain the relevant code span that needs to be addressed to fix the possible bug.

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
