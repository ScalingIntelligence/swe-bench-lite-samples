The problematic code snippet suggests that a chararray's `replace` method is used, which, as noted, returns a copy rather than performing an in-place operation. To address this issue, it's necessary to find all occurrences of this pattern and ensure they are corrected. Given the potential impact on data handling, especially in file formats like FITS, it's crucial to verify the handling of floating-point values across the module. Additionally, the absence of failing tests for this code suggests that testing might be insufficient, warranting a review of existing tests or the addition of new ones.",

The code under scrutiny is part of the '_scale_back_ascii' method within the 'FITS_rec' class. Given this context, the relevant code spans would be the 'FITS_rec' class definition and the '_scale_back_ascii' method where the problematic code snippet is located.

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
