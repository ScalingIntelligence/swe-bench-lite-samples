The specific code in question is in `fitsrec.py` where a replacement of 'E' with 'D' is attempted, but it seems it may not be working as intended because the `replace` method is not operating in-place. Since this code is part of the scaling back process, it's crucial to ensure that floating-point representations are accurately converted. Additionally, the fact that removing the code doesn't cause any tests to fail suggests a lack of adequate testing in this area. I will focus the search on the `fitsrec.py` file to specifically look for any uses of `_scale_back_ascii` and related methods, as well as the use of `replace` on floating point fields.",
