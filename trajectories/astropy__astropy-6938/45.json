Since commenting out the code does not cause any tests to fail, it suggests inadequate test coverage. The primary focus should be on the `fitsrec.py` file, specifically the `_scale_back_ascii` method. Additionally, exploring the surrounding methods and functions related to scaling and conversion is pertinent.",

The concern is that `replace` is not an in-place operation for `chararray` (it returns a copy) and that the code might not be tested. The search results include the relevant file `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` and a function `_scale_back_ascii` which contains the exact code snippet mentioned in the issue. This function is part of the `FITS_rec` class. Analyzing the function, it indeed contains the problematic line where it attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in `output_field`, which is a `chararray`.
