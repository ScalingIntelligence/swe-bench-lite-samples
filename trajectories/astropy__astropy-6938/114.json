Additionally, there seems to be concern that this code may not be adequately tested. Upon reviewing the provided file context and search results, the relevant part of the code can be found in the '_scale_back_ascii' method within the 'FITS_rec' class, specifically where it checks if 'D' is in the format and attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in the 'output_field'. Given that the search results exactly match the file context, it confirms the presence of the potentially problematic code snippet. This analysis indicates that the issue is squarely focused on this specific code span, which needs to be corrected to ensure proper handling of 'D' exponent separators.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
