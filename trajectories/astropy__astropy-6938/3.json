The focus should be on the methods and classes involved in handling formatting and conversions within the `fitsrec.py` file.\n\nSteps to address the issue could include: updating the `replace` method call to properly handle the modification, ensuring the modifications are correctly integrated with the rest of the data handling, and writing new tests to prevent future regressions.",
