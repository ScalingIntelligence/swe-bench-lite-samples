The specific code snippet identified is in `fitsrec.py`: `output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))`. The issue suggests that this was intended to be an in-place replacement, but it is not, as the `replace` method for `chararray` returns a copy, not modifying the original array in place.\n\nReviewing the search results, especially `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py`, the focus should be on any code related to floating-point number formatting and character array manipulations.\n\n- `FITS_rec._scale_back` and `FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii` methods are found in `fitsrec.py`. These functions are likely responsible for scaling back data after some modifications, possibly involving floating-point numbers.\n- `_format_float` in `astropy/io/fits/card.py` is also relevant, as it directly formats floating-point values, potentially including checking and formatting exponents.\n- Methods like `BinTableHDU._dump_data` and `BinTableHDU._load_data` in `astropy/io/fits/hdu/table.py` deal with reading and formatting tabular data, which might include floating-point numbers and thus could be affected by the same issue.\n\nGiven these findings, it's clear that the relevant spans can include operations on floating-point numbers and possibly methods that transform or convert these numbers, notably those in `fitsrec.py` and `card.py`.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
