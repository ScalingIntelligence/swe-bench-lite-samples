The code snippet provided in the issue indicates that there's a section of code dealing with the replacement of 'E' with 'D' in floating point numbers. This exactly matches the functionality described in the search results within the `FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii` method. The method is responsible for scaling back ASCII values and includes the code that handles the replacement of 'E' with 'D' for floating point numbers. It's notable that the method does not test the affected code directly, which aligns with the issue's claim that commenting out the code doesn't affect any tests. Based on this alignment, I identify the relevant code span in the `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` file, specifically within the `FITS_rec._scale_back_ascii` method.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
