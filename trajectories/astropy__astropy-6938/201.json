The provided search results contain the `_scale_back_ascii` method within the `FITS_rec` class, which includes a section of code that aligns with the reported issue. This section checks if 'D' is in the format and then attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in the `output_field`. However, as per the issue description, this code might be incorrect because `replace` does not modify `output_field` in place. Therefore, the relevant code span to address this issue is the specific line within the `_scale_back_ascii` method.",

Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
