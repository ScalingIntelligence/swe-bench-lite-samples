The problem is with a code snippet that attempts to replace the exponent separator in floating-point numbers, but it seems to incorrectly handle the `replace` method for `chararray`, which does not perform an in-place operation but returns a copy instead. This error may not have been caught by tests, suggesting that further investigation is needed in the same file or possibly related utility functions. Since the problem is specifically in the context of floating-point numbers and the manipulation of their representation in string format, focus should be on the `fitsrec.py` file and related utilities that handle FITS data formatting and conversion.",

Specifically, it points out a code segment that attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in a floating point number but suggests that the replace method is not in-place, which means it might not work as intended. The provided search results contain the relevant code within the `_scale_back_ascii` method of the FITS_rec class. The code in question closely matches the description in the issue, involving the replacement of 'E' with 'D' in the output_field. This code block appears to be related to formatting floating point numbers in a specific format within an ASCII table in a FITS file. Since this directly addresses the issue and is located in the expected file, it is relevant to the reported problem. Additionally, the issue notes that commenting out this code does not cause any tests to fail, implying that this functionality might not be adequately tested. The provided code spans indeed cover the critical part of the bug report.",
