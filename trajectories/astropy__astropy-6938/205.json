  "initial_message": "Possible bug in io.fits related to D exponents\nI came across the following code in ``fitsrec.py``:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers\r\n        if 'D' in format:\r\n            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this may be incorrect because as far as I can tell ``replace`` is not an in-place operation for ``chararray`` (it returns a copy). Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.\n"
