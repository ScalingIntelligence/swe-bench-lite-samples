The error occurs in the Pathlib module, specifically in the resolve method within the iter_modules_and_files function in django/utils/autoreload.py. This could be due to a null byte in a file path or a race condition where a file is being accessed while it's being modified. Given the sporadic nature of the error and its connection to Pathlib, focusing on the autoreload logic in django/utils/autoreload.py is crucial. Additionally, considering the stack trace, examining the runserver command in django/core/management/commands/runserver.py might provide more context. Investigating how file paths are handled and resolved in these files could lead to identifying the root cause.",

The issue specifically points to the use of Pathlib, which might not handle certain path-related operations correctly, leading to the embedded null byte error. Given this context, the task is to identify relevant code spans in the provided search results that handle file paths or are involved in the autoreloading process. The initial context shows that both 'django/utils/autoreload.py' and 'django/core/management/commands/runserver.py' are relevant because they import Pathlib and use it in functions like iter_modules_and_files. In this case, the search results offer additional insights. For example, the 'iter_modules_and_files' function in 'django/utils/autoreload.py' explicitly deals with file paths and uses Pathlib to resolve paths, which matches the reported issue. The Command class in 'django/core/management/commands/runserver.py' is also relevant as it handles the running of the server and ties in with auto-reloading functionalities. This provides a clear linkage from the issue to specific parts of the codebase via the stack trace provided.",

  "initial_message": "Auto-reloading with StatReloader very intermittently throws \"ValueError: embedded null byte\".\nDescription\n\t\nRaising this mainly so that it's tracked, as I have no idea how to reproduce it, nor why it's happening. It ultimately looks like a problem with Pathlib, which wasn't used prior to 2.2.\nStacktrace:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"manage.py\" ...\n\texecute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 381, in execute_from_command_line\n\tutility.execute()\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 375, in execute\n\tself.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 323, in run_from_argv\n\tself.execute(*args, **cmd_options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 60, in execute\n\tsuper().execute(*args, **options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 364, in execute\n\toutput = self.handle(*args, **options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 95, in handle\n\tself.run(**options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 102, in run\n\tautoreload.run_with_reloader(self.inner_run, **options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 577, in run_with_reloader\n\tstart_django(reloader, main_func, *args, **kwargs)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 562, in start_django\n\treloader.run(django_main_thread)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 280, in run\n\tself.run_loop()\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 286, in run_loop\n\tnext(ticker)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 326, in tick\n\tfor filepath, mtime in self.snapshot_files():\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 342, in snapshot_files\n\tfor file in self.watched_files():\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 241, in watched_files\n\tyield from iter_all_python_module_files()\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 103, in iter_all_python_module_files\n\treturn iter_modules_and_files(modules, frozenset(_error_files))\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 132, in iter_modules_and_files\n\tresults.add(path.resolve().absolute())\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 1120, in resolve\n\ts = self._flavour.resolve(self, strict=strict)\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 346, in resolve\n\treturn _resolve(base, str(path)) or sep\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 330, in _resolve\n\ttarget = accessor.readlink(newpath)\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 441, in readlink\n\treturn os.readlink(path)\nValueError: embedded null byte\nI did print(path) before os.readlink(path) in pathlib and ended up with:\n/Users/kez\n/Users/kez/.pyenv\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/asyncio\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/asyncio/selector_events.py\n/Users\nIt always seems to be /Users which is last\nIt may have already printed /Users as part of another .resolve() multiple times (that is, the order is not deterministic, and it may have traversed beyond /Users successfully many times during startup.\nI don't know where to begin looking for the rogue null byte, nor why it only exists sometimes.\nBest guess I have is that there's a mountpoint in /Users to a samba share which may not have been connected to yet? I dunno.\nI have no idea if it's fixable without removing the use of pathlib (which tbh I think should happen anyway, because it's slow) and reverting to using os.path.join and friends. \nI have no idea if it's fixed in a later Python version, but with no easy way to reproduce ... dunno how I'd check.\nI have no idea if it's something specific to my system (pyenv, OSX 10.11, etc)\n"
