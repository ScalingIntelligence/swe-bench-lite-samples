Given the stack trace, the error occurs within Django's autoreload utility when trying to resolve file paths. The error suggests that a file path with an embedded null byte is causing the issue. Since Pathlib was introduced in Django 2.2, reverting to using os.path functions might be a workaround. Additionally, the issue might be specific to the system environment, including pyenv and OSX 10.11. To debug further, we should focus on the autoreload.py file where the error occurs and potentially related files handling file paths and system operations.",

The error is triggered by a path containing an embedded null byte, which is leading to the ValueError. To further investigate, we need to focus on the exact lines within `autoreload.py` where `Pathlib`'s `resolve` method is employed, as this is where the error occurs. Additionally, we should explore the broader context of how file paths are being processed and managed within the autoreload operation. Examining the environmental factors such as interactions with specific filesystems or mounted shares might also provide insights into the root cause. Given the context provided, it is clear that the error originates from the `autoreload.py` module, specifically in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where paths are being resolved. Thus, the search should primarily focus on refining our understanding and context within `autoreload.py`.",

The relevant code snippet is found in iter_modules_and_files function of autoreload.py, which handles the path resolution for module files. The specific line causing the issue is 'resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()'. This line attempts to resolve the path and convert it to an absolute path, which likely triggers the ValueError due to the presence of an embedded null byte. Since the exact code causing the issue is identified within the provided file context, it's considered relevant and sufficient to conclude that all relevant code for addressing this issue is present.",
