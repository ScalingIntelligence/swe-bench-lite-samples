The stacktrace points to pathlib's resolve method, specifically the point where it attempts to read a symlink using os.readlink(path), which is causing the ValueError. The issue suggests a potential problem with a mountpoint to a samba share or general issues with using pathlib, indicating a need to look into the autoreload mechanism more deeply. The current file context provides functions related to safe joining of file paths and checking if symlinks are supported, which are relevant to path handling but don't directly address the null byte issue. The new search results confirm the use of pathlib in the autoreload module, specifically in functions iter_all_python_module_files and iter_modules_and_files, where pathlib's Path and resolve methods are used. These functions are critical in identifying and resolving file paths during the autoreloading process, making them highly relevant to the reported issue. Therefore, the focus should be on these code spans within django/utils/autoreload.py to further investigate and potentially modify the handling of file paths to avoid the null byte error.",
