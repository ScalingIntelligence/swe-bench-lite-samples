This error occurs within the context of Pathlib, which is a part of the autoreload mechanism in Django. The stack trace indicates that the error originates from the Pathlib module, suggesting a need to investigate the handling of file paths within the autoreload functionality. Given the intermittent nature and lack of reproducibility, it would be beneficial to focus on the autoreload module and related functions that deal with file paths and module loading. Additionally, the report mentions that Pathlib was not used prior to version 2.2, implying that the issue might be related to changes in file handling introduced with the new version.",
