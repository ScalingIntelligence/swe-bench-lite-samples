The stack trace indicates the error occurs in the auto-reloading mechanism of Django's `runserver` command, specifically within the `autoreload.py` file. To diagnose and potentially resolve the issue, we should focus on the logic within the `autoreload.py` file where Pathlib is used for file path manipulations. Given the intermittent nature and the complexity of Pathlib in handling certain system paths, a detailed review of how file paths are resolved and manipulated is necessary. Additionally, since the error might be related to specific system configurations (like samba shares or pyenv setups), we should also consider the broader context in which the application is running.",
