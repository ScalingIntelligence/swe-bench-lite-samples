The stack trace indicates that the error occurs during the process of resolving paths in the `django/utils/autoreload.py` module, specifically in the `iter_modules_and_files` function where `Path.resolve()` is called. It seems that there might be an issue with resolving certain paths that contain null bytes. The provided search results include several key spans in the `autoreload.py` module that are directly related to the path resolution and file watching mechanisms. `iter_all_python_module_files` and `iter_modules_and_files` both play crucial roles in identifying files to watch and resolve their paths. By analyzing these sections of the code, we can better understand how path resolution is performed and potentially identify where and why a null byte might be introduced. The relevant spans include the initialization of the Path object (`path = Path(filename)`) and the subsequent resolution of this path (`resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()`). These spans are critical for understanding the path resolution process and its potential failure points.",

The stack trace indicates this issue occurs in Django's autoreload utility, specifically in the context of resolving files using pathlib. The traces point to the `iter_modules_and_files` function, which iterates over modules and files and tries to resolve their paths. This function uses pathlib to resolve absolute paths of the files. The search results present code spans primarily from the 'django/utils/autoreload.py' file, which aligns with the context provided by the stack trace. The relevant spans include the module imports, which import pathlib, indicating that the problem may involve interoperation between Django's autoreload mechanism and Python's pathlib functions. Other relevant spans are the definitions of functions `iter_all_python_module_files` and `iter_modules_and_files`, which directly involve iterating over and resolving module and file paths. These functions are critical as they assemble the paths and then attempt to resolve them strictly, which is where the exception appears to occur. Based on the analysis of the issue and reviewing the enclosed code sections, the identified spans seem to be directly related to the problem reported with resolving paths during the Django auto-reloading process, specifically involving the use of pathlib that might encounter a rogue null byte.

The stack trace indicates that the error occurs when 'Pathlib' is used to resolve paths, suggesting a potential issue with the handling of paths or file systems. The current file context shows relevant code in 'django/utils/autoreload.py' that involves the import of 'Pathlib' and the function 'iter_all_python_module_files', which is crucial as it iterates through all Python module files and resolves their paths. The new search results reaffirm this context, revealing additional related functions and classes in the same file, such as 'BaseReloader' and its methods '__init__' and 'watched_files'. The 'watched_files' method is particularly relevant as it yields from 'iter_all_python_module_files', indicating it is part of the chain where the error might be triggered.
