The error seems to be related to the Pathlib module, which wasn't used prior to version 2.2. The stack trace points to the autoreload functionality in Django's utils module. Given the nature of the error, it might be tied to file path handling, possibly due to an anomaly in the file system or a specific directory like '/Users'. The issue might be system-specific, involving environments like pyenv on OSX 10.11. To address this, it's recommended to focus on the `django/utils/autoreload.py` file, specifically the `iter_modules_and_files` and `iter_all_python_module_files` functions, as these are central to path resolution during auto-reloading. Additionally, checking the `pathlib` usage in these functions might provide insights into where and how the null byte is introduced.",

  "initial_message": "Auto-reloading with StatReloader very intermittently throws \"ValueError: embedded null byte\".\nDescription\n\t\nRaising this mainly so that it's tracked, as I have no idea how to reproduce it, nor why it's happening. It ultimately looks like a problem with Pathlib, which wasn't used prior to 2.2.\nStacktrace:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"manage.py\" ...\n\texecute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 381, in execute_from_command_line\n\tutility.execute()\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 375, in execute\n\tself.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 323, in run_from_argv\n\tself.execute(*args, **cmd_options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 60, in execute\n\tsuper().execute(*args, **options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 364, in execute\n\toutput = self.handle(*args, **options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 95, in handle\n\tself.run(**options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 102, in run\n\tautoreload.run_with_reloader(self.inner_run, **options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 577, in run_with_reloader\n\tstart_django(reloader, main_func, *args, **kwargs)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 562, in start_django\n\treloader.run(django_main_thread)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 280, in run\n\tself.run_loop()\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 286, in run_loop\n\tnext(ticker)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 326, in tick\n\tfor filepath, mtime in self.snapshot_files():\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 342, in snapshot_files\n\tfor file in self.watched_files():\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 241, in watched_files\n\tyield from iter_all_python_module_files()\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 103, in iter_all_python_module_files\n\treturn iter_modules_and_files(modules, frozenset(_error_files))\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 132, in iter_modules_and_files\n\tresults.add(path.resolve().absolute())\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 1120, in resolve\n\ts = self._flavour.resolve(self, strict=strict)\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 346, in resolve\n\treturn _resolve(base, str(path)) or sep\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 330, in _resolve\n\ttarget = accessor.readlink(newpath)\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 441, in readlink\n\treturn os.readlink(path)\nValueError: embedded null byte\nI did print(path) before os.readlink(path) in pathlib and ended up with:\n/Users/kez\n/Users/kez/.pyenv\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/asyncio\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/asyncio/selector_events.py\n/Users\nIt always seems to be /Users which is last\nIt may have already printed /Users as part of another .resolve() multiple times (that is, the order is not deterministic, and it may have traversed beyond /Users successfully many times during startup.\nI don't know where to begin looking for the rogue null byte, nor why it only exists sometimes.\nBest guess I have is that there's a mountpoint in /Users to a samba share which may not have been connected to yet? I dunno.\nI have no idea if it's fixable without removing the use of pathlib (which tbh I think should happen anyway, because it's slow) and reverting to using os.path.join and friends. \nI have no idea if it's fixed in a later Python version, but with no easy way to reproduce ... dunno how I'd check.\nI have no idea if it's something specific to my system (pyenv, OSX 10.11, etc)\n"
