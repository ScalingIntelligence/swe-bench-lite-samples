This error appears to be related to the use of Pathlib, which wasn't used prior to Django 2.2. The error occurs when handling paths, possibly due to a null byte being present in a path string. Given the stack trace and the nature of the error, focusing on the autoreload module in Django where Pathlib is used seems appropriate. Additionally, understanding how paths are being handled and resolved in the autoreload module and its dependencies is crucial. Since the error might be specific to the system environment (involving pyenv on OSX), it's also important to consider system-specific path handling.",

The functions 'iter_modules_and_files', 'watch_file', and 'snapshot_files' are particularly noteworthy as they handle paths directly. Additionally, the initial error trace indicated that the issue arises during the 'readlink' operation within Pathlib, suggesting that the problem could be related to the way file paths are resolved or handled before being passed to Pathlib. Given that the error occurs in 'pathlib.py' from the standard library, understanding how paths are processed within 'autoreload.py' is crucial. Furthermore, searching for custom modules that might manipulate paths using Pathlib could uncover potential sources of the null byte error, particularly focusing on string handling before paths are converted to Pathlib objects. This comprehensive approach ensures that all potential avenues involving Pathlib and file path handling are thoroughly investigated.",
