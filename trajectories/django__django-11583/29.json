This error specifically points to the use of Pathlib in the autoreload.py module. The stack trace provided clearly indicates that the error originates from the `pathlib.py` module when resolving paths. The relevant sections of code in the search results are primarily from `django/utils/autoreload.py`, specifically the `iter_all_python_module_files` and `iter_modules_and_files` functions, where `pathlib.Path` is used to resolve paths. Additionally, the `django/utils/_os.py` file contains functions related to safe path joining and checking if symlinks are supported, which might indirectly be related to the path handling issues. These functions (`safe_join` and `symlinks_supported`) could also be relevant if the issue extends to how Django handles files and directories, including symlinks. Therefore, these sections are identified as relevant based on the issue description and the stack trace provided.",

This directly aligns with the stack trace provided in the issue, indicating that the error occurs within the path resolution logic. The issue suggests that the error might be related to how Pathlib handles certain paths, such as those involving potential null bytes. The presence of Pathlib in the autoreload module and the specific methods used (like Path.resolve()) strongly suggests that this file context is relevant to the reported issue. Also, the file django/utils/_os.py, which provides utilities for safe file joining and symlink support, while not directly causing the issue, provides context on how Django handles file paths and links, which could be relevant for a deeper understanding of path-related issues in Django.
