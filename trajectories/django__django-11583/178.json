The issue seems to be related to the Pathlib module, which wasn't used prior to Django 2.2. The stack trace provided leads us directly to the 'autoreload.py' file, specifically the 'iter_all_python_module_files' and 'iter_modules_and_files' functions, where the Pathlib's 'resolve' method is utilized. This method is crucial for resolving the file paths, and it's likely where the null byte error is being triggered. Given the issue's link to Pathlib and the specific functions in 'autoreload.py', these are clearly relevant to investigate further. The 'runserver.py' file is also relevant as it directly interacts with the autoreload utility. The 'safe_join' function in 'django/utils/_os.py' might be indirectly related to the issue if it handles problematic path joins that could lead to null bytes.",
