The error occurs specifically with Pathlib and seems related to filesystem operations, potentially involving symlinks or certain file paths on the system. Given the intermittent nature and the complexity of the error, it's crucial to focus on the areas where Pathlib or filesystem handling is used within Django's autoreload mechanism. These areas include the handling of modules and files, particularly the iter_all_python_module_files and iter_modules_and_files functions, which process paths and might interact with symlinks or readlink methods.
