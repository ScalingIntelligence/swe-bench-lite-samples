Given the stack trace, the error originates from the `pathlib.py` file, indicating a potential problem with how Pathlib handles certain paths, possibly due to an embedded null byte. Since the issue seems to be sporadic and potentially related to specific system configurations (like mountpoints to samba shares that might not be connected yet), we need to focus the search on code related to path resolution and file watching within Django's autoreload mechanism. Specifically, we should look into the `iter_modules_and_files` and `watched_files` methods in `django/utils/autoreload.py` as these methods might be encountering files with embedded null bytes.",

The stack trace points to a problem within the pathlib module. Analyzing the provided search results, four key code spans are identified as relevant: 1. 'imports' span, which imports pathlib and other necessary modules for file handling. 2. 'iter_all_python_module_files' span, which iterates through all Python module files, including handling weak references. 3. 'iter_modules_and_files' span, which uses functools.lru_cache for caching and resolves file paths using Path.resolve(). This is where the potential issue could arise with the null byte, as per the error description. 4. 'BaseReloader.watched_files' span, which yields files from various sources, including the results of iter_all_python_module_files. All these spans are crucial as they involve file path resolution and module file handling, directly related to the reported issue. I have also noted that the stack trace indicates the error occurs during the resolution of paths within iter_modules_and_files, strengthening the relevance of this span. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans cover the relevant parts of the auto-reloading mechanism that could be causing the 'embedded null byte' error.",

  "initial_message": "Auto-reloading with StatReloader very intermittently throws \"ValueError: embedded null byte\".\nDescription\n\t\nRaising this mainly so that it's tracked, as I have no idea how to reproduce it, nor why it's happening. It ultimately looks like a problem with Pathlib, which wasn't used prior to 2.2.\nStacktrace:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"manage.py\" ...\n\texecute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 381, in execute_from_command_line\n\tutility.execute()\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 375, in execute\n\tself.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 323, in run_from_argv\n\tself.execute(*args, **cmd_options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 60, in execute\n\tsuper().execute(*args, **options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 364, in execute\n\toutput = self.handle(*args, **options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 95, in handle\n\tself.run(**options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py\", line 102, in run\n\tautoreload.run_with_reloader(self.inner_run, **options)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 577, in run_with_reloader\n\tstart_django(reloader, main_func, *args, **kwargs)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 562, in start_django\n\treloader.run(django_main_thread)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 280, in run\n\tself.run_loop()\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 286, in run_loop\n\tnext(ticker)\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 326, in tick\n\tfor filepath, mtime in self.snapshot_files():\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 342, in snapshot_files\n\tfor file in self.watched_files():\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 241, in watched_files\n\tyield from iter_all_python_module_files()\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 103, in iter_all_python_module_files\n\treturn iter_modules_and_files(modules, frozenset(_error_files))\n File \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\", line 132, in iter_modules_and_files\n\tresults.add(path.resolve().absolute())\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 1120, in resolve\n\ts = self._flavour.resolve(self, strict=strict)\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 346, in resolve\n\treturn _resolve(base, str(path)) or sep\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 330, in _resolve\n\ttarget = accessor.readlink(newpath)\n File \"/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/pathlib.py\", line 441, in readlink\n\treturn os.readlink(path)\nValueError: embedded null byte\nI did print(path) before os.readlink(path) in pathlib and ended up with:\n/Users/kez\n/Users/kez/.pyenv\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/asyncio\n/Users/kez/.pyenv/versions/3.6.2/lib/python3.6/asyncio/selector_events.py\n/Users\nIt always seems to be /Users which is last\nIt may have already printed /Users as part of another .resolve() multiple times (that is, the order is not deterministic, and it may have traversed beyond /Users successfully many times during startup.\nI don't know where to begin looking for the rogue null byte, nor why it only exists sometimes.\nBest guess I have is that there's a mountpoint in /Users to a samba share which may not have been connected to yet? I dunno.\nI have no idea if it's fixable without removing the use of pathlib (which tbh I think should happen anyway, because it's slow) and reverting to using os.path.join and friends. \nI have no idea if it's fixed in a later Python version, but with no easy way to reproduce ... dunno how I'd check.\nI have no idea if it's something specific to my system (pyenv, OSX 10.11, etc)\n"
