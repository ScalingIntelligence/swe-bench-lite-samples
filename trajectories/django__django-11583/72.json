Specifically, the functions 'iter_all_python_module_files' and 'iter_modules_and_files' along with the 'StatReloader' class are directly involved in the file watching mechanism, where the problematic 'Path.resolve()' method is used. These functionalities are central to the auto-reloading process as described in the stack trace, explaining why this code is relevant to the issue at hand. Furthermore, understanding the broader context in 'django/utils/autoreload.py' is crucial, as it holistically addresses auto-reloading mechanisms in Django, encompassing not just the specific error encountered but also how different parts of the system interact during this process.

This function is responsible for iterating over module files and resolving their paths. The specific line `resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()` indicates that the function is using `Path.resolve()` from the `pathlib` module, which is where the `ValueError: embedded null byte` issue is suspected to originate. Since the investigation revolves around pathlib's handling of paths and the potential introduction of null bytes, the file context provided includes the necessary code to assess this issue. Given this information, it seems that the relevant code has been identified.",
