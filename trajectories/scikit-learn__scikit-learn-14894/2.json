To address this, it's crucial to identify the section of the code where this division takes place and understand how to handle the empty support_vectors_ scenario. From the search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the 'BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit' and 'BaseLibSVM.fit' spans. These sections contain the logic for fitting the SVM model with sparse data and handling the support vectors. Specifically, the 'BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit' span includes the division that leads to the ZeroDivisionError.
