The `_sparse_fit` method is responsible for training the SVM model with sparse data. The error occurs in the division operation where `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class` is calculated. Analyzing the `_sparse_fit` method, it's evident that when `support_vectors_` is empty, the calculation of `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class` will result in zero division as `dual_coef_indices` will be empty and `n_class` will not be zero in typical cases. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those that involve the calculation and setting of `dual_coef_` in the `_sparse_fit` method. These spans include the specific lines where `dual_coef_indices` and `dual_coef_indptr` are calculated and used to create the `dual_coef_` sparse matrix. Additionally, the method that sets up the data for the SVM training using `libsvm_sparse.libsvm_sparse_train` is relevant.",
