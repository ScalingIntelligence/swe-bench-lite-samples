This suggests that the necessary context to address the issue is present, as modifications to this method would be needed to handle the case where `support_vectors_` is empty. However, while the relevant method is identified, the specific check against an empty `support_vectors_` or equivalent condition to prevent the division by zero is not explicitly implemented. Further, if `support_vectors_` being empty leads to `n_class` being zero, which may not be immediately visible within this method due to potential external dependencies or conditions, additional investigation around the class instantiation or handling of `support_vectors_` might be required. Therefore, while I have identified the relevant method, more context might be needed to fully resolve the issue without suggesting changes to the code or understanding more deeply the external factors influencing `support_vectors_` and `n_class`.",
