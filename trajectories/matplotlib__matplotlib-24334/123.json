The issue points out that the `**kwargs` passed to these methods are only validated if `ticklabels` are set, which might lead to silent failures if incorrect `kwargs` are provided. The proposed solution suggests that `kwargs` should be validated in all cases, or an error should be raised if `labels` are not set. The search results provide the definitions of the `Axis` class, including its `__init__` method, `set_ticklabels`, and `set_ticks`. These methods are directly related to the issue, as they handle the setting of ticks and tick labels on an axis. However, the current implementations do not include any validation or error handling for `kwargs` if `labels` are not provided. Therefore, identifying the code spans containing `set_ticklabels` and `set_ticks` is crucial for addressing the issue.",

  "initial_message": "[ENH]: Axes.set_xticks/Axis.set_ticks only validates kwargs if ticklabels are set, but they should\n### Problem\n\nPer the doc of `Axis.set_ticks`:\r\n```\r\n        **kwargs\r\n            `.Text` properties for the labels. These take effect only if you\r\n            pass *labels*. In other cases, please use `~.Axes.tick_params`.\r\n```\r\nThis means that in e.g. `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=[\"a\", \"b\"])`, the incorrect `xticklabels` silently do nothing; they are not even validated (because `labels` has not been passed).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe should at least check that `kwargs` are valid Text properties in all cases; we could even consider making any kwargs an error if `labels` is not set.\n"
