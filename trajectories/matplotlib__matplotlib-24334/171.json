It is mentioned that currently, `kwargs` are only validated if `ticklabels` are set, but this should be enforced in all cases. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans within the `Axis` class. The search results provide three key spans: 'Axis.set_ticklabels', 'Axis._set_ticklabels', and 'Axis.set_ticks'. These spans correspond directly to the functions mentioned in the issue, making them highly relevant. 'Axis.set_ticklabels' is particularly important as it handles the setting of tick labels and the application of `kwargs`. Additionally, 'Axis.set_ticks' is relevant because it calls 'Axis.set_ticklabels' when labels are provided, integrating the functionality discussed in the issue. By examining these spans, we can start implementing the proposed solution which includes validating `kwargs` in all cases, not just when `labels` are set.",

These take effect only if you\r\n            pass *labels*. In other cases, please use `~.Axes.tick_params`.\r\n```\r\nThis means that in e.g. `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=[\"a\", \"b\"])`, the incorrect `xticklabels` silently do nothing; they are not even validated (because `labels` has not been passed).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe should at least check that `kwargs` are valid Text properties in all cases; we could even consider making any kwargs an error if `labels` is not set.\n"
