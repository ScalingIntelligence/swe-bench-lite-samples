Given the detailed context on related files, the search should target methods like set_ticks and set_ticklabels in the Axis and Axes classes. A multi-param search will be conducted to focus on code snippets involving these methods and the validation of kwargs.",

The search results include relevant code spans from `lib/matplotlib/axis.py` and `lib/matplotlib/axes/_secondary_axes.py`. In `axis.py`, the `Axis` class and its `set_ticks` method are directly related to the issue, providing the context for how ticks and labels are set. Additionally, in `axes/_secondary_axes.py`, the `SecondaryAxis` class has its own `set_ticks` method, which is a direct adaptation of `Axis.set_ticks` and should also be considered in the solution. Both `set_ticks` methods currently only check `kwargs` if `labels` are provided, which aligns with the described issue.
