  "initial_message": "[ENH]: Axes.set_xticks/Axis.set_ticks only validates kwargs if ticklabels are set, but they should\n### Problem\n\nPer the doc of `Axis.set_ticks`:\r\n```\r\n        **kwargs\r\n            `.Text` properties for the labels. These take effect only if you\r\n            pass *labels*. In other cases, please use `~.Axes.tick_params`.\r\n```\r\nThis means that in e.g. `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=[\"a\", \"b\"])`, the incorrect `xticklabels` silently do nothing; they are not even validated (because `labels` has not been passed).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe should at least check that `kwargs` are valid Text properties in all cases; we could even consider making any kwargs an error if `labels` is not set.\n"
