The current implementation only validates the kwargs if ticklabels are explicitly passed, which can lead to potential silent failures if incorrect kwargs are provided. The proposed solution suggests that we should validate the kwargs every time these methods are called, and potentially raise an error if kwargs are provided without setting ticklabels. Given the detailed context provided, I will focus the search on relevant methods within the `axis.py` file to ensure comprehensive code coverage.",

These take effect only if you\r\n            pass *labels*. In other cases, please use `~.Axes.tick_params`.\r\n```\r\nThis means that in e.g. `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=[\"a\", \"b\"])`, the incorrect `xticklabels` silently do nothing; they are not even validated (because `labels` has not been passed).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe should at least check that `kwargs` are valid Text properties in all cases; we could even consider making any kwargs an error if `labels` is not set.\n"
