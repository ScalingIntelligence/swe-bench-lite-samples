The code analysis should focus on functions related to pretty printing MatAdd operations and handling MatrixSymbols. From the provided search results, '_print_MatAdd' methods in both 'PrettyPrinter' (in pretty.py) and 'LatexPrinter' (in latex.py) classes seem relevant. These methods are responsible for pretty-printing matrix additions and might contain the logic that is causing the issue due to the handling of string arguments possibly derived from MatrixSymbols. Additionally, understanding the overall structure and logic in these methods will be crucial to identify if they correctly handle or bypass the problematic input. Notably, the 'PrettyPrinter._print_MatAdd' method in pretty.py appears to assume certain forms of inputs (like checking if the first argument is negative), which might be leading to the issue when encountering strings like 'y*'. This method and its assumption should be carefully reviewed. The 'LatexPrinter._print_MatAdd' method also appears relevant due to its similar responsibility of handling matrix additions for LaTeX printing. Both methods will be extracted for further analysis to determine if they correctly or incorrectly handle the specific error case reported.",
