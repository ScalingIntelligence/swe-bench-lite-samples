The traceback indicates that the error is triggered by the sympify function trying to handle a string argument from MatrixSymbol, which seems to be inappropriate. Additionally, there's a mention of a SyntaxError related to an unexpected EOF while parsing. The question also points out that the code assumes certain forms for the arguments of MatAdd, especially concerning how negative arguments are handled. To address this, it's necessary to focus on the MatAdd handling functions in the pretty printing module and the general management of expressions in sympy.",
