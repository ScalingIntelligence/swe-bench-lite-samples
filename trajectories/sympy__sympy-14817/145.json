The error traceback points to the '_print_MatAdd' method in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' as the source of the issue. This method is responsible for rendering a matrix addition in a human-readable format. The key investigation points should focus on how string arguments are handled within this method and how 'sympify' is being utilized. Furthermore, the method's handling of negative arguments, as noted in the issue description, should also be reviewed to ensure that it doesn't make assumptions about the form of the arguments that might lead to unexpected behavior. Given these points, the relevant code spans to investigate are those within the '_print_MatAdd' method across the different printer classes ('PrettyPrinter', 'StrPrinter', and 'LatexPrinter'), along with any associated helper methods that might contribute to the rendering logic of matrix addition.",
