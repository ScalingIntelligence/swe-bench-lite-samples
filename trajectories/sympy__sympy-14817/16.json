The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the MatAdd class during the handling of negative matrix elements. The key points to note are that sympify is being used unnecessarily and a SyntaxError is being raised due to improper handling of the string 'y*'. The code analysis reveals that the MatAdd class indeed uses sympify in its __new__ method to process the arguments before creating a new instance. This aligns with the reported issue of sympify being used to handle MatrixSymbol arguments. The presence of sympify in MatAdd.__new__ suggests that this is the part of the code that needs to be adjusted to avoid direct sympification of MatrixSymbol arguments. Understanding the MatAdd class's handling of arguments and its relationship with sympify is crucial for addressing the issue directly in the relevant file, 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py'.",

The file context provided includes both 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py' and 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py'. In 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', the _print_MatAdd method is identified, which is crucial as it directly handles the pretty printing of MatAdd expressions. The method iterates over the arguments of the MatAdd expression, checking if the first argument of each item is negative to decide whether to print a '+' or a space. This aligns with the issue's description of problematic handling of negative expressions. The provided file context appears to cover the relevant code needed to understand and potentially address the issue.",
