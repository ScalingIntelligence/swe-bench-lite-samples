The error traceback suggests an unexpected EOF while parsing a string ('y*') and a subsequent SympifyError indicating that the string could not be parsed. This points to the necessity of a method to handle MatrixSymbol inputs without relying on 'sympify'. The search results provide snippets from relevant files: 'matadd.py' and 'pretty.py', which contain the class definitions for MatAdd and its pretty printing respectively. The task involves identifying the parts of the code within the search results that handle the pretty printing and construction of MatAdd, and determining if they are relevant to addressing the reported issue.\n\nIn 'pretty.py', the '_print_MatAdd' method is responsible for pretty printing of MatAdd expressions. The method iterates over the arguments of MatAdd and constructs the pretty representation. The condition 'if S(item.args[0]).is_negative:' implies a check against negative items, which aligns with the issue of improperly handling the addition of matrices with negative elements.\n\nIn 'matadd.py', the 'MatAdd' class definition and its methods such as 'doit' and 'merge_explicit' are relevant as they deal with the addition and simplification of matrix expressions. The 'merge_explicit' function specifically handles the merging of MatrixBase objects, an essential part of matrix addition operations.\n\nGiven the identified code spans, the search results are relevant to the reported issue and provide insights into how MatAdd objects are handled in the codebase. Further, analysis of the '_print_MatAdd' method in 'pretty.py' is crucial to understand the direct interaction with the reported issue.",

Additionally, the PrettyPrinter class contains methods like _print_MatAdd that directly address the printing of MatAdd expressions, including the problematic handling of negative values.

The error occurs due to the use of sympify on string arguments from MatrixSymbol, which is not appropriate. Additionally, there seems to be a concern about the handling of the '+' operator when the first argument is negative.\n\n2. Reviewing the current context: The provided file context already points to relevant files and spans within sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py and sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py. These files are crucial as they deal with matrix addition and pretty printing of matrix expressions.\n\n3. Processing new search results:\n   - sympy_core_sympify.py: This file contains the sympify function, which is mentioned in the error trace as being involved in the error. It converts a string input to a symbolic expression, which seems to be causing the problem when applied to MatrixSymbol.\n   - sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py: Multiple spans within this file are relevant, especially those handling the pretty printing of MatAdd expressions. The _print_MatAdd method is of particular interest as it directly addresses the print formatting of matrix additions.\n   - sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py: This file contains the MatAdd class and its relevant methods such as __new__, shape, _eval_transpose, _eval_trace, and doit. These sections are crucial for understanding the behavior and structure of MatAdd objects.\n   - sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py: This file defines the MatrixExpr and MatrixSymbol classes, both of which are fundamental to understanding the symbolic representation of matrices in SymPy.\n   - sympy/matrices/immutable.py: While not directly related to the printing issue, it's worth noting that this file contains handling of immutable matrices, which might indirectly influence the parsing and representation of matrix expressions.\n\n4. Extracting relevant spans: Based on the alignment with the reported issue, the following spans are identified as most relevant:\n   - From sympy/core/sympify.py: The sympify function as it's central to the reported error.\n   - From sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py: The _print_MatAdd method, specifically the handling of matrix addition printing.\n   - From sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py: The MatAdd class and its various handling methods, especially dealing with shape and transformation (transpose, trace).\n\nThis analysis suggests that the search results are relevant and sufficient to address the reported issue, as they cover the functions and classes involved in the error pathway and the pretty printing process of matrix additions.",
