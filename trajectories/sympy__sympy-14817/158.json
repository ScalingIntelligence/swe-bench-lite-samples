            "scratch_pad": "I analyzed the provided reported issue and identified several key points of concern. The main issues are related to the handling of MatrixSymbol in pretty printing, specifically when encountering negative signs and how the code interprets strings within MatrixSymbol. Additionally, there's a concern about the assumption in the code that arguments of MatAdd will always be in a certain form, particularly when checking for negativity and printing without the '+' sign.\n\nReviewing the search results, I focused on the specific spans related to MatrixSymbol and MatAdd, as those are directly related to the reported issue. Part of the issue mentioned concerns the use of sympify on string arguments from MatrixSymbol, so I also looked for related spans handling these operations.\n\nThe found spans provide some useful context on how MatrixSymbol and MatAdd are actually processed in the pretty printer. They include the import statements at the beginning, which are foundational for understanding where the functions and operations are sourced from. The span 'PrettyPrinter._print_MatAdd' specifically implements the pretty printing for Matrix addition, which exhibits the problematic logic regarding the negativity check and the handling of printing '+' signs.\n\nBased on the analysis, I extracted details from the spans associated with what PrettyPrinter does internally for both general pretty print operations and specifically for the pretty print of Matrix operations like addition. This selection helps in directing where modifications should be made to address the handling of negativity and associated printing in MatrixSymbol operations.\nTherefore, the relevant code span identifiers that align closest to the reported issue are 'imports' for the definition context and 'PrettyPrinter._print_MatAdd' as it directly contains the logic associated with the printing of Matrix additions.",
