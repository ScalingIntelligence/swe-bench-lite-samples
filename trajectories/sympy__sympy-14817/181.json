The `MatAdd` class definition and its `_print_MatAdd` method are directly related to the reported issue. The `sympify` function used in the `MatAdd` class definition is also relevant as it is identified as the source of the problematic behavior. Additionally, the `_print_MatAdd` method in the `pretty.py` file is where the pretty printing logic for `MatAdd` is implemented, and it contains the logic that checks for negative symbols and potentially causes the issue when dealing with string arguments from `MatrixSymbol`. These sections of code are crucial for addressing the reported issue and understanding its root cause.",

The provided search results include code spans from the files sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py and sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py. In these files, there are relevant sections for MatAdd and its pretty printing. The MatAdd class in matadd.py is responsible for defining how matrix addition works, including handling different scenarios like merging explicit matrices, validating arguments, and defining the shape of the matrix. The PrettyPrinter in pretty.py is responsible for handling the pretty printing of various mathematical expressions, including MatAdd. It deals with the pretty formatting and handling of matrices in the context where the first argument might or might not be negative, among other scenarios. Identified relevant code spans in matadd.py include 'MatAdd.__new__', 'MatAdd.shape', 'MatAdd._entry', 'MatAdd._eval_transpose', 'MatAdd._eval_adjoint', 'MatAdd.doit', and the 'validate' function. These spans cover essential functionalities like matrix validation, entry calculation, transpose and adjoint evaluation, and matrix canonicalization with the 'doit' method. In pretty.py, 'PrettyPrinter._print_MatAdd' is relevant, dealing with the pretty printing of matrix addition expressions, ensuring correct formatting for both negative and non-negative arguments. Since these identified snippets thoroughly address the error in pretty printing MatAdd and handle cases with or without negative components, there's a high likelihood that they are the most relevant spans for solving the reported issue. Thus, the task of identifying relevant code sections seems fairly comprehensive given these findings.",
