The error occurs because the code uses `sympify` to handle string arguments from `MatrixSymbol`, which is inappropriate. Additionally, the code incorrectly handles the `+` operator when the first argument is negative, which suggests deeper issues with the handling of `MatAdd` expressions. From the provided search results, several relevant code spans can be identified: 1. The `_print_MatAdd` method in `PrettyPrinter` class within `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` appears to be directly involved in the pretty printing of `MatAdd` expressions and contains the problematic logic for handling negative arguments. 2. The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` is also relevant as it is the function being incorrectly used to handle the string arguments, leading to the `SyntaxError`. The other `_print_MatAdd` methods in `LatexPrinter` and `StrPrinter` might also need to be reviewed to ensure consistency and correctness, but they do not directly address the `sympify` issue. Based on this analysis, the identified spans should help address the core issue of the `SyntaxError` and the improper use of `sympify` for handling `MatrixSymbol` arguments.",

            "scratch_pad": "Upon analyzing the reported issue, it is clear that the primary concern is the misuse of sympify when handling string arguments from MatrixSymbol during pretty printing. This misuse results in a SyntaxError. The key sections of the code that need to be examined are those related to pretty printing MatAdd and MatrixSymbol. From the file context, we have already identified the relevant _print_MatAdd method in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py, which we need to compare with the new search results. Additionally, we need to identify any new instances of MatrixSymbol handling or sympify usage in the provided search results to ensure they align with fixing the issue. Examining the new _print_MatAdd methods in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py, sympy/printing/latex.py, and sympy/printing/str.py should reveal whether they address the issue of handling MatAdd correctly without invoking sympify on string arguments from MatrixSymbol. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that the pretty printing of matrices does not misuse sympify, which is a crucial part of resolving the user-reported issue.",

'pretty.py' contains the '_print_MatAdd' method where the issue arises: it checks if the first argument of 'MatAdd' is negative and then processes it with 'sympify'. This usage of 'sympify' with 'MatrixSymbol' inputs seems responsible for the reported error.
