This would enable dynamic resolution of the file path based on the machine or context where the migration is being run. The provided search results contain several key parts of Django's migration framework that are relevant to this issue.\n\nThe initial context in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` defines the `FilePathField` class and its `__init__` method. This is where the current static `path` parameter is defined.\n\nThe search results include several key files and spans:\n\n1. `django/db/migrations/writer.py`: This file contains the `MigrationWriter` class which is responsible for writing migration files. The `as_string` method is particularly relevant as it serializes migration operations, including any field modifications.\n\n2. `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`: This file contains the `serializer_factory` function and various serializers used to convert Python objects into a format suitable for migration files. This includes `ModelFieldSerializer` which would be relevant for serializing instances of `FilePathField`.\n\n3. `django/db/migrations/state.py`: This file contains the `ProjectState` and `ModelState` classes which are used to represent the state of a project's models at different points in time. This is particularly relevant for reflecting changes in model fields such as `FilePathField`.\n\nGiven the context and the search results, the relevant sections include those that deal with initialization and serialization of model fields in the context of migrations. These sections will need to be modified to accommodate a callable `path` parameter for `FilePathField`.\n\nThe key spans to identify are those that deal with field initialization and serialization, as these will need to be adapted to handle the new functionality of accepting a callable for the `path` parameter in `FilePathField`.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue is about allowing the `FilePathField` path to accept a callable, which would enable dynamic path resolution based on the machine's settings. This feature isn't natively supported by the `FilePathField` currently. The user wants to avoid manually changing migrations every time the path changes between machines. The provided context already includes details on `FilePathField` initialization and deconstruction, which are relevant but do not address the callable aspect. The search results, particularly from `django/db/migrations/writer.py` and `django/db/migrations/state.py`, provide insights into how migrations handle serialization and model state management, which is indirectly related to the issue but doesn't directly provide a solution. Given this, it's apparent that the current codebase does not directly support the requested feature, and an enhancement or workaround would likely need to be developed by extending or modifying the `FilePathField` class or handling migrations differently.",
