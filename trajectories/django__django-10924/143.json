Specifically, we need to look at the definition and initialization of FilePathField in both the models and forms fields to understand how the path attribute is currently handled and how it can be modified to accept a callable. In the provided search results, we have relevant code spans in multiple files that are crucial for understanding and implementing this change. Most notably, the FilePathField class in both django/db/models/fields/__init__.py and django/forms/fields.py are key. Additionally, the django/db/migrations/writer.py file contains important logic for migration writing, which will be relevant when changes to the FilePathField are made and migrations are generated. From the context, it's clear that the path attribute currently accepts a string, and the task is to enhance it to accept a callable. This will require a modification in the __init__ method of FilePathField in both the model and form fields, potentially adding logic to evaluate the callable and obtain the path dynamically. However, direct modifications to the code should be done with caution to maintain compatibility and avoid breaking changes. These identified spans provide a foundational context for understanding where and how these changes could be implemented, but further detailed modifications are needed to fully resolve the issue.",

From the file context, it's evident that the current implementation of FilePathField in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py does not support callable paths directly. There's no specific handling for callables in the __init__ method of FilePathField. Additionally, examining django/db/migrations/writer.py shows no special handling for serializing callables within the migration context, which would be crucial for dynamically determining paths during migrations. Lastly, in django/forms/fields.py, the FilePathField there doesn't offer any support for handling callable paths either.
