The search results contain the definition and initialization of the FilePathField in the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file, which is directly relevant to the issue. Specifically, the `FilePathField.__init__` span contains the constructor where the `path` parameter is initially defined. This span is crucial for understanding how to modify or extend the FilePathField to accommodate a callable for the path. Additionally, the `DeconstructableSerializer.serialize_deconstructed` span in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` may be relevant for how the path is serialized in migrations, but the primary focus should remain on the `FilePathField` definition.

Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"
