This would allow for dynamic resolution of file paths depending on the environment, such as development or production machines. The provided search results include the FilePathField class definition, its initialization method (__init__), and the deconstruct method. These are relevant because they define how the FilePathField operates and how it can be configured. Specifically, the FilePathField.__init__ span is crucial as it defines the parameters that can be passed to FilePathField, including the 'path' parameter that currently does not support callables. This is where the modification would need to be made to accept and correctly handle a callable for the path. The deconstruct method also has context as it is responsible for serializing the field's configuration, which would need updating if the path can be a callable.",

The current implementation of `FilePathField` in the Django codebase takes a static path which is resolved at migration creation time. This static path resolution is problematic when the path varies based on the environment (e.g., development vs. production). To address this, we need to identify parts of the code that deal with the `FilePathField` initialization and deconstruction, as these would be the primary places to modify to allow for a callable path. After examining the search results, I found relevant code spans in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`. Both of these files contain essential parts of `FilePathField` definition, initialization, and serialization processes. The `FilePathField.__init__` method in the first file constructs the field with a static path, and the `DeconstructableSerializer.serialize_deconstructed` method in the second file handles serialization of field properties. These are the main areas where modifications would need to be made to support a callable path. Including these spans provides a comprehensive view of where the new functionality should be integrated.",

Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"
