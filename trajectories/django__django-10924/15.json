Additionally, the 'deconstruct' method in FilePathField could be where changes are needed to support callables.

This would enable the path to be set dynamically during migrations, avoiding the need to manually change the migration files. The current FilePathField definition in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py accepts a static 'path' argument, which is not suitable for dynamic paths. To address the issue, the FilePathField would need to be modified to accept a callable. This could either be implemented directly in the FilePathField definition or through an enhancement to the Django framework. In the provided search results, the FilePathField class and its constructor (FilePathField.__init__) are relevant as they define the structure and behavior of the FilePathField, where the 'path' parameter can be modified to accept a callable. Additionally, the deconstruct method (FilePathField.deconstruct) is relevant as it deals with serialization and deserialization of the field during migrations, which would need to handle the callable path correctly. The other files (django/db/migrations/*) are also relevant as they deal with the migration process itself and would need to be aware of the new functionality in the FilePathField for correct migration operations. These files are part of the migration framework and are crucial for understanding how migrations are loaded, handled, and written, which is relevant for ensuring that the new dynamic path functionality integrates well with the migration process.",

Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"
