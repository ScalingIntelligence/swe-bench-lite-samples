This is to ensure that the path is dynamically calculated based on the machine where the migration is run, thus avoiding hardcoding paths. The relevant parts of the codebase are expected to be found within the FilePathField class in the 'fields' submodule of 'django.db.models', as well as possibly in the migrations-related modules such as 'migrations.serializer' and 'migrations.writer'. Additionally, the 'FileField' in 'fields.files' might also be relevant as it shares some functionalities with 'FilePathField'.",

These spans provide the necessary context to understand how `FilePathField` is currently defined and how its `path` argument is handled. The `FilePathField.__init__` span shows that the `path` argument is currently a string. To address the issue, modifications would need to be made to allow this argument to accept a callable. The other spans in this file, such as `Field`, `_load_field`, and other field classes, provide contextual information on how fields are generally defined and loaded in Django models. The `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` and `django/db/migrations/writer.py` files also provide insight into how migrations are serialized and written, which could be relevant if changes to `FilePathField` necessitate migrations.

This would enable dynamic path resolution that adapts to different environments or machines. Currently, the `FilePathField` only accepts a static string for the `path`, which leads to the need for manual migration adjustments. It appears that modifying the `FilePathField` in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/forms/fields.py` to accept a callable could address this issue.\n\nIn the provided search results, the sections of code that define the `FilePathField` in both `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/forms/fields.py` are relevant. Specifically, the `__init__` method for `FilePathField` in both files sets the `path` parameter directly. To resolve the issue, these methods need to be modified to handle a callable if provided, or a string if static. This involves checking the type of the provided `path` and evaluating it if it's a callable at runtime, while still accepting a static string as an alternative. The modifications would need to be made in both the model and form fields definitions to ensure consistency and full functionality. This approach would replace the current fixed path approach with a dynamic one that adapts to the environment at runtime without requiring manual migration adjustments.",

To support dynamic path calculation via callables, adjustments are needed in how the 'path' parameter is handled during the migration process. This involves examining how 'FilePathField' instances are serialized and deserialized in the migration files, which is likely to be managed in the 'serializer.py' and 'writer.py' files within the 'migrations' module.

Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"
