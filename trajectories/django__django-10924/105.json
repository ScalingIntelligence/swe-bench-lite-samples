The relevant code spans include the definition of FilePathField and its __init__ method where the path parameter is set.\n\nTo address the issue, modifications would need to be made to FilePathField to accept a callable for the path parameter. This might involve changing the __init__ method to check if the provided path is a callable and then handle it appropriately. Additionally, changes would be necessary in the deconstruct method to ensure that the migration files can handle this new feature appropriately.\n\nGiven the current context and search results, the identified relevant code spans are sufficient to understand the current implementation of FilePathField, but no immediate solution exists within the provided code to directly address the issue of making the path callable.

Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"
