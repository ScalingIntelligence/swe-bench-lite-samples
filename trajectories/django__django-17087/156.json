The error arises because the migration file incorrectly references a class method from a nested class. To fix this, we need to identify where the default value for the field is being incorrectly set in the migration process. The likely culprits are the `Model` and `Field` classes, along with the `MigrationRecorder` and `Migration` classes, as they handle model definitions and migration operations. Additionally, the `ArrayField` from `django/contrib/postgres/fields/array.py` might be involved since it's a special type of field that could potentially handle defaults differently. We should focus our search on these classes and their methods.",

            "scratch_pad": "Upon analyzing the reported issue, it appears that the problem stems from the use of a class method from a nested class being used as the default value for a field in a Django model. Specifically, the issue arises because the migration file incorrectly refers to 'appname.models.Capability.default' instead of 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'. This discrepancy needs to be corrected to avoid errors during migration.\n\nThe search results provided include several relevant files from the Django codebase, notably:\n\n1. **django/db/models/fields/mixins.py** - Contains the CheckFieldDefaultMixin, particularly focusing on how default values are checked for being callable. This is highly relevant as the issue involves the use of a class method as a default.\n\n2. **django/db/models/base.py** - This file contains the ModelBase and Model classes, dealing with how models are defined, including methods for adding to classes and preparing classes.
