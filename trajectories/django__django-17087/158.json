            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the use of class methods from nested classes as default values for fields in Django models. Specifically, the issue is that the migration generated contains an incorrect default value, leading to an error when trying to migrate. The correct value should reference the default method from the nested class within the model.\n\nThe analysis of the provided search results reveals several potential relevant code spans:\n\n1. **django/db/models/base.py - Model class**: This class is central to Django's model definition and includes methods such as `__init__` and `_check_default_pk`. The `__init__` method handles the initialization of model instances, including setting default values for fields. It's possible that the issue arises from how defaults are handled here.\n\n2. **django/db/models/fields/mixins.py - CheckFieldDefaultMixin class**: This mixin is responsible for checking the default values of fields. The `_check_default` method specifically checks if the default value is a callable, which is relevant to the issue since the default should be a callable to avoid sharing instances between field instances.\n\n3. **django/db/models/fields/__init__.py - Field class**: This is the base class for all field types in Django. Methods like `get_default`, `has_default`, and `get_prep_value` are relevant as they handle the default values for fields during various stages of data preparation, including for migrations.\n\n4. **django/db/migrations/state.py - ProjectState class**: This class represents the state of a project's models at a given point in time and is used during the migration process. Methods like `resolve_model_field_relations` and `resolve_model_relations` deal with resolving relationships between models, which could be where the incorrect default value is introduced.\n\nGiven these findings, it appears that the search results provide relevant code spans that could be contributing to the issue. These spans cover the initialization of model instances, the handling of field defaults, and the resolution of model relationships during migrations.\n\nIt's important to review these sections thoroughly to understand how the default values are being processed and ensure they correctly reference the nested class methods as required. Further inspection of these code spans may lead to a resolution of the reported issue.",

The specific error occurs because the default value is incorrectly set as 'appname.models.Capability.default' instead of 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'. The provided search results contain several relevant files and code spans relating to the management of fields and migrations in Django. The file 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' contains the 'AddField' class which is responsible for adding fields to models during migrations. This class includes methods such as 'state_forwards' and 'database_forwards' which handle the state and database changes when a field is added. These methods are critical as they show how default values are managed during migrations. Additionally, the 'django/db/migrations/state.py' file includes the 'ProjectState' class which is used to keep track of the state of a project during migrations. This class includes methods like 'resolve_model_relations' and 'resolve_model_field_relations' which are necessary for understanding how model relationships are resolved during migrations. These methods can help in diagnosing why the default value might be incorrect. Overall, these files and methods provide insight into how fields and models are managed during migrations in Django, which is crucial for addressing the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the usage of class methods from nested classes as the default value for a field in Django models. Specifically, the issue arises when a class method from a nested class (Capability) is used as the default value for a field (capabilities) in the Profile model. The error occurs because the migration incorrectly refers to 'appname.models.Capability.default' instead of 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'. To address this issue, it is necessary to identify the relevant code spans that handle the addition of fields and the corresponding default value in Django's migration framework.\n\nFrom the provided search results, several key code spans are pertinent to the issue at hand. These include:\n1. 'AddField' operation in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py': This operation is responsible for adding new fields to models, which is central to the reported issue. The 'AddField' class has methods for initializing the operation, deconstructing it, updating the state forwards and backwards, and executing the database forwards and backwards operations.\n2. 'ProjectState' class in 'django/db/migrations/state.py': This class represents the project's state at a particular point in time and includes methods for adding, removing, and altering fields, which are crucial for understanding how field defaults are managed during migrations.\n3. 'MigrationAutodetector' class in 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py': This class is responsible for automatically detecting changes in models and generating the corresponding migrations. It includes methods for adding operations, generating created models, and resolving dependencies, which are relevant for understanding how the system handles class method defaults.\n\nThese code spans provide insights into how fields are added to models and how defaults are managed during migrations, which are essential for addressing the reported issue.",

The files 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py', 'django/db/migrations/state.py' are particularly relevant as they handle the logic for adding and altering fields during migrations, including the management of default values. The provided code includes methods like 'AddField.state_forwards', which is directly involved in the process of adding new fields to models during the state phase of migrations, and 'MigrationAutodetector._generate_added_field', which generates operations for adding new fields, potentially setting default values. These methods touch on the mechanics described in the issue of 'default' in 'migrations.AddField'. However, the specific bug regarding incorrect handling of nested class methods as default values, leading to misinterpretation within migrations (as reported in the issue), is not directly addressed within the provided code snippets. The context around how Django handles such nested class methods within the migration process, particularly concerning the correct resolution of class names and paths, is not fully covered.
