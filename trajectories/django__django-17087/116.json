The current code causes an error because the migration file incorrectly references the method. To resolve this, we need to find the part of the Django source code that generates migrations and ensures that the correct method reference is used. This can be found in the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file and potentially in the `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file for how migrations are serialized and processed.",

The issue points out that the migration file contains an incorrect reference to the class method as the default value. The provided search results are from Django's migration framework, specifically the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file. This file contains the `CreateModel` and `AddField` operations, which are relevant because they deal with adding models and fields, including setting default values for fields. The `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` class and its methods also provide insight into how field options can be altered, potentially affecting the way defaults are handled. In the `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file, several serializer classes are defined, which might be responsible for converting Python objects into a format suitable for migration files. Given the issue, it's likely that the `AddField` operation in the `models.py` file handles the default value incorrectly, leading to the error. There isn't a direct span that fixes the issue, but the context around how defaults and field operations are handled in Django migrations is relevant. No specific span ID directly fixes the issue, but understanding the context provided by these code spans is crucial for resolving the reported issue.",
