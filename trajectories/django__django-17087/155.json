Specifically, the 'default' argument is incorrectly set to a class method from a nested class, leading to an error during migration. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the 'default' argument in the migration process.\n\n1. Analyze the reported issue: The issue describes a scenario where a class method from a nested class is used as a default value in a model's field. This results in an incorrect reference in the migration file, causing an error.\n\n2. Review the current context: There is no existing relevant code identified yet.\n\n3. Process new search results:\n   - In 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'Model' class and its '__init__' method are found. This class is central to Django's ORM and could be relevant if the issue involves model instantiation or initialization.\n   - In 'django/db/models/options.py', the 'Options' class and its 'default_manager' property are found. Although this deals with managing model options, it may not directly relate to the 'default' argument issue.\n   - In 'django/db/models/query_utils.py', the 'DeferredAttribute' class is found. This class is related to deferred loading of model attributes and could be relevant if the issue involves loading default values.\n   - In 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', the 'OperationWriter' class and its 'serialize' method are found. This class is responsible for serializing migration operations, making it highly relevant to the issue.\n   - In 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', the 'MigrationRecorder' class is found. This class records migration actions and could be relevant if the issue involves recording default values.\n   - In 'django/db/migrations/state.py', the 'ProjectState' class and its 'resolve_fields_and_relations' method are found. This class represents the state of a project's models during migrations and is relevant to the issue.\n   - In 'django/db/migrations/serializer.py', several serializer classes are found. These classes are responsible for converting Python objects into a format suitable for migration files, making them relevant to the issue.\n\n4. Decide on relevant code spans:\n   - The 'OperationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' is the most pertinent, as it directly deals with the serialization of migration operations, including the 'default' argument.\n   - The 'ProjectState' class in 'django/db/migrations/state.py' is also relevant, as it involves resolving field relations and could play a role in how default values are processed during migrations.\n   - The 'DeferredAttribute' class in 'django/db/models/query_utils.py' is relevant if the issue involves deferred loading of default values.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans are in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py', 'django/db/migrations/state.py', and 'django/db/models/query_utils.py'.",

The context provided has code related to migration writing and project state management in Django, which is relevant to the issue as migrations are intimately tied to model changes and field default handling. The new search results contain code from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, which includes various field types and their handling, which is directly relevant to the issue as it involves a specific field type (ArrayField) and its default value.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, I will identify the relevant spans of code from the search results that deal with field initialization and serialization, as these processes are critical for understanding how field defaults are handled and why the issue arises. Specifically, I will focus on the `BinaryField` class and its methods, which although unrelated directly to ArrayField, offer insights into Django's field handling, which might surface patterns relevant to the reported issue.",
