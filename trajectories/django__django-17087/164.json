The key problem is that the migration incorrectly refers to the default class method using a dot-separated path, causing an error. The relevant code spans identified are primarily in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file, particularly the 'AddField' class which is responsible for adding fields to models during migrations, and the 'AlterField' class which is used when modifying existing fields. These classes handle how fields are added and altered, including setting default values for fields. The identified spans include '__init__', 'deconstruct', 'state_forwards', and 'database_forwards' methods within the 'AddField' and 'AlterField' classes. These methods are crucial for understanding how field defaults are managed and how they are represented in migrations. The 'RemoveField' and 'RenameField' classes are also relevant as they are part of the field operations and provide context on how different field operations can affect the migration process.",

The file context provided includes the `AddField` class from Django's migration operations, which is crucial for understanding how fields are added to the database and how their default values are handled. It's essential to ensure that nested class methods used as default values are correctly referenced during schema migrations. The `database_forwards` method in `AddField` is particularly relevant, as it deals with adding the field to the database and temporarily updating the field's default value. However, the file context does not directly address the specific issue of referencing nested class methods correctly in the `default` parameter of `AddField`. This suggests that while the context provides critical information on how Django deals with field operations, it does not directly highlight the specific issue of nested class method references.",

Specifically, the migration generated the default value for the 'capabilities' field incorrectly as 'appname.models.Capability.default' instead of 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'. This leads to an error during migration execution. The current file context and search results focus on the operations used to manage fields in migrations, particularly the AddField operation. The AddField operation is central to this issue as it directly deals with the addition of fields, including their default values. The relevant sections of code from the search results include the __init__, deconstruct, state_forwards, and database_forwards methods of the AddField class. These methods are crucial for understanding how the default value of a field is handled during the migration process. The AddField class initialization directly affects how the default value is passed and processed. The deconstruct method is responsible for serializing the operation for migration file generation, which involves the default value. The state_forwards method updates the model's state, and database_forwards actually applies the field addition to the database schema, including handling the default value conditionally based on self.preserve_default. Given these analyses, the search results are relevant and directly address the reported issue by providing the necessary context and implementation details of the AddField operation.",
