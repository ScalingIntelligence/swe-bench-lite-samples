Specifically, the error arises because the migration file incorrectly references the class method, causing a failure when attempting to migrate the database schema. I initially analyzed the provided file context in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py and identified the Field class and its __init__ method, which are relevant because they define how fields are initialized in Django models, including the handling of default values. The search results provided additional sections of code from various files within the Django codebase, including further details on the Field class initialization, and how fields like BooleanField, CharField, etc., are defined. To address the reported issue, the critical piece of code to examine is the AddField class in django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py, particularly its __init__ method, which is responsible for adding a field to a model during a migration. This method initializes the field and determines whether the default value should be preserved, a key aspect related to the issue at hand. The other classes and methods, while relevant to understanding Django's field and model handling, do not directly pertain to the specific issue of using a class method as a default value for a field in a migration.",

The error occurs because the migration operation 'AddField' receives an incorrect default value for the 'default' argument. The correct value should reference the default method of the nested class within the model. Analysis of the search results shows that the relevant code spans for addressing this issue are found in two files: 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py'. In 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', the 'Field' class and its 'default' parameter in the '__init__' method are relevant since this is where field defaults are defined. In 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', the 'AddField' class and its '__init__' method are relevant because this is where migrations add new fields to models, which includes setting the field's default value. Therefore, understanding and modifying these sections can help resolve the reported issue.",
