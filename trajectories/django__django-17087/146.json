These files are responsible for serializing Django model fields and writing migration operations, respectively. The issue reported is about the improper serialization of a nested class method as a default value for a field in a Django model, leading to incorrect references in migration files. The code in 'serializer.py' shows the handling of different types of values, including models.Field, and uses a deconstruct method to serialize fields. 'writer.py' deals with writing operations, including the serialization of operation arguments. Based on the context provided, it appears that these files do involve the mechanisms related to the issue at hand, as they directly handle the serialization and writing of model fields and their attributes, including default values. However, the specific code related to handling nested class methods as default values within these files is not explicitly shown. To accurately assess if all relevant code is provided and the issue can be addressed, a deeper inspection of how 'deconstruct' and 'serialize' methods handle class method references and nested classes might be necessary.

Additionally, the 'OperationWriter' class in 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' is responsible for writing these operations to migration files. It uses the 'deconstruct' method to understand how to write each operation correctly.
