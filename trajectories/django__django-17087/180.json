The error arises because the migration file incorrectly references the default method of the nested class. The current file context provides insights into the ArrayField implementation, and the search results focus on the AddField operation in migration operations.\n\nThe issue at hand is how the AddField operation handles the default value for the field. The AddField operation's constructor initializes the field with a default value, and its deconstruct method serializes the field for use in migrations. The database_forwards method applies the field to the database schema, and the database_backwards method rolls it back. The reduce method handles how the operation interacts with other field operations.\n\nThe key spans to identify are those related to how the default value is managed and applied during the migration process. The AddField.__init__ and AddField.deconstruct spans are particularly relevant, as they involve setting up and serializing the field with its default value, which seems to be where the error described in the issue occurs.\n\nGiven this analysis, it's clear that the AddField code spans in the search results are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the reported issue with nested class methods as default values.",
