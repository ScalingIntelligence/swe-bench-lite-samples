The issue is with the migration file generation and specifically the 'default' argument in the 'AddField' operation. The provided search results show several instances where 'default' is handled, but they mostly relate to JSON encoding or template filters, which are not directly relevant to the issue at hand. The most relevant code section is found in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', specifically the 'AddField' class, which directly deals with adding fields to models during migrations. This class contains methods that handle the default value of fields, such as '__init__', 'deconstruct', and 'database_forwards', which are all directly related to the process of adding fields and setting their defaults within the migration context. These methods are the primary focus as they encapsulate the logic around applying default values during the migration process. Thus, understanding and potentially modifying these methods will be crucial in addressing the reported issue.",

The specific case involves a nested class `Capability` within the `Profile` model, where a class method `default` is intended to be used as the default value for the `capabilities` field. The issue arises because the migration system is incorrectly referencing `appname.models.Capability.default` instead of `appname.models.Profile.Capability.default`.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are found in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, specifically within the `AddField` class. This class is responsible for adding fields to models during migrations and includes several methods such as `__init__`, `deconstruct`, `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, and `database_backwards`. These methods are directly related to the core functionality of handling field additions in migrations.\n\nThe search results contain other files and spans, but these are not directly relevant to the reported issue. For instance, `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py` and `django/core/serializers/json.py` relate to message storage and JSON serialization, respectively, which are unrelated to the migration issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, it is apparent that the current search results effectively address the reported issue, as the relevant code spans are accurately identified in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file.

Specifically, the migration refers to 'appname.models.Capability.default' instead of 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'. The relevant code spans provided include several sections related to the AddField operation in Django's migration framework. The AddField class and its methods, such as __init__, deconstruct, state_forwards, database_forwards, and database_backwards, are all critical for understanding how field addition is handled during migrations. These methods work with the field's default value, which is directly implicated in the issue. Other search results are not directly relevant to the issue of handling class methods as default values for fields in migrations. Therefore, the focus should remain on the AddField operation in the migrations framework to correct how default values, especially those involving nested class methods, are handled during the migration process.",

The provided model demonstrated this problem when attempting to set the `default` of the `capabilities` field using the `default` class method from the nested `Capability` class. The specific issue arises because the migration process incorrectly references the `default` method using its full path (e.g., 'appname.models.Capability.default') instead of the correct nested class path (e.g., 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'). The search results include various files and code spans, but the most relevant section appears to be the `AddField` operation in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', as it manages the addition of fields to models during migrations. This section needs careful review to ensure that the nested class method is correctly referenced and handled. Additionally, examining the `default` methods in the other files will shed light on how the default values are managed in different contexts to offer a comprehensive solution to the reported issue.",
