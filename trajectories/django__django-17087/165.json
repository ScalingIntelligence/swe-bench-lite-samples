The error arises because the migration file incorrectly references 'appname.models.Capability.default' instead of 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'. \n\nThe search results provide a detailed look into the AddField operation within Django's migration framework. This operation is directly related to adding fields to models during migrations. By analyzing the spans, it's clear that the AddField class is responsible for defining the behavior when adding a new field to a model during a migration. The crucial part here is the handling of the 'default' attribute for the field. Specifically, the 'database_forwards' method adjusts the field's default during the migration process. \n\nGiven the nature of the issue (incorrect default reference in a migration), the relevant spans are those dealing with how default values are managed in the AddField operation. These include the '__init__', 'deconstruct', 'state_forwards', 'database_forwards', and 'database_backwards' methods. The 'reduce' method is not directly related to the default issue but is part of the bigger picture of field operations during migrations.",

Specifically, the migration contains an incorrect reference to the nested class method in the default argument of the `AddField` operation. The current context already contains relevant code spans from `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, notably the `AddField` class and its methods, which handle the addition of fields to models during migrations. The new search results include additional files and code spans from `django/db/migrations/state.py` and `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. The `ProjectState` class in `django/db/migrations/state.py` is relevant as it manages model states during migrations, including adding and renaming fields. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` is also relevant as it handles the SQL schema operations, including the actual SQL statement generation for altering fields. Both of these classes are involved in the process of defining and applying migrations, so their code spans are relevant to the issue.",

However, the specific issue of correctly resolving nested class method references for the 'default' parameter is not directly addressed in the provided code snippets.
