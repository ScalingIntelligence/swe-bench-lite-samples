Specifically, the default value for the 'capabilities' field in the 'Profile' model is incorrectly set as 'appname.models.Capability.default' rather than 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'. This mistake causes an error during migration. To resolve this, we need to identify where the 'default' value is being set for the 'capabilities' field and ensure it points to the correct path. Given the nature of the issue, the relevant code is likely in the definition of the 'Profile' model and possibly in the migration operations that handle field addition. We should focus on the model definition and migration operations.",

Using the former leads to an error because it does not correctly refer to the class method.\n\nFrom the search results, the most relevant file is 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. Within this file, the 'CreateModel' class method is particularly relevant, as it deals directly with model creation and field addition during migrations.

            "scratch_pad": "In analyzing the reported issue, the primary concern is how class methods from nested classes are being used as defaults in model fields, specifically with the `ArrayField` in the `Profile` model. The issue points out that the default value for the `ArrayField` is set to `Capability.default`, which is a class method of a nested class. This is causing issues when Django tries to generate migrations. The provided context includes relevant sections from `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, which contain classes and methods related to model operations and field definitions in Django. These sections include `CreateModel`, `FieldOperation`, and `Field` classes, which are crucial for understanding how fields and models are created and manipulated in migrations. The new search results focus on `AddField` in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. The `AddField` class is used to add new fields to models in migrations. The `__init__` method of `AddField` shows how the field is added to the model, including the handling of the default value through the `preserve_default` parameter. This class is directly relevant to the issue at hand, as it deals with the addition of fields in migrations, where the default value of the field could be a method or a static value. Based on the relevance of `AddField` to the reported issue, it is identified as a key point of interest. By examining these code spans, it's clear that the issue revolves around how the default value is specified in the `AddField` operation, which directly ties into the problem described in the issue where a class method is used as a default value.\n\nTo solve this issue, it is crucial to understand how to correctly reference nested class methods as defaults, and ensure that the migration operations handle these references correctly, without causing errors during the migration process. The current context and search results provide a good starting point for addressing this issue by showing how fields are added and how defaults are managed in migrations.",
