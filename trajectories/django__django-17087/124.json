This issue is primarily related to the instantiation and handling of fields in Django models. The search results primarily focus on the implementation of various field types within Django's `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. Notably, the `Field` class and its subclasses define how fields are initialized, including the handling of the `default` parameter. This initialization code is critical for understanding how default values are set, which could help address the issue of using a class method as a default. The `CheckFieldDefaultMixin` in `django/db/models/fields/mixins.py` provides additional context on checks related to field defaults, which might indirectly relate to the issue if there were any system checks failing due to the incorrect default value setup.\n\nGiven the context of the issue and the provided code, the relevant parts are the `Field` class definition, particularly the `__init__` method where the `default` parameter is handled. This section of the code is directly linked to the problem of setting a nested class method as a default value, as it illustrates how field defaults are expected to be managed in Django. The other field-specific classes, though extensive, are less directly relevant as they inherit from `Field` and do not modify its `default` handling significantly. Therefore, focusing on the `Field` class initialization should provide the necessary insights to understand and potentially resolve the reported issue.",
