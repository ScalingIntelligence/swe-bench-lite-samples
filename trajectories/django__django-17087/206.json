The problem arises when the migration tries to use the nested class method as the default value, which leads to an error. The relevant code snippets and classes to look for are the Profile model, its nested Capability class with the default class method, and the use of ArrayField in the Profile model. Additionally, the search should focus on the migration operations and how defaults are handled in these operations.",
