The class method 'default' from a nested class 'Capability' within the 'Profile' model is causing an error when generating migrations due to the incorrect reference format. This suggests that the search should focus on the handling of class methods and their use as default values in Django's field definitions, specifically within ArrayField. Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate how migrations handle field defaults and class methods to pinpoint where the reference resolution could be failing.",

The user provided an example model with a nested class 'Capability' that includes a class method 'default'. When a migration is generated, the default value for the 'capabilities' field is incorrectly set as 'appname.models.Capability.default', which leads to an error. The correct default should be 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'. The provided search results include files that deal with Geometry fields and migration operations in Django, particularly the 'GeometryField' class and the 'AddField' class. These are likely not directly related to the issue described. However, they are part of the broader context of Django's handling of database fields and migrations, which may indirectly relate to the reported issue.

The problematic code defines a `Profile` model with a nested `Capability` class, which has a class method `default`. The `capabilities` field in the `Profile` model uses `Capability.default` as its default value, leading to a migration error because the default value is incorrectly set to `appname.models.Capability.default` instead of `appname.models.Profile.Capability.default`. This issue involves understanding how Django models and fields are defined, how nested classes are referenced, and how migrations are created. The search results include code spans related to Django's `Field` class and other model-related functionality, which are relevant to understanding the issue and potential fixes.\n\nRelevant code spans are identified by looking for parts of the code that define `Field`, `ArrayField`, and `Model` classes in Django, as these are the components directly related to the reported issue. In particular, the `ArrayField` class and its initialization method are relevant because the issue involves a `default` argument for a field type that accepts an array. The `Model` class and its initialization method are also relevant as they define how Django models are constructed and the rules for field initialization within models.\n\nBased on the analysis of the code and the reported issue, the task is not complete because there are distinct code spans in the search results that could help fix the issue by correctly defining the `default` value for a Django model field, especially in the context of nested classes. Therefore, relevant code spans should be extracted from the search results to further understand and solve the issue with the incorrect default value in migrations.",
