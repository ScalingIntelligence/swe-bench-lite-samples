Specifically, in the Profile model's Capability nested class, the default method is being used in the capabilities ArrayField's default parameter. The problem arises when the migration attempts to reference this default method because it incorrectly uses 'appname.models.Capability.default' instead of 'appname.models.Profile.Capability.default'. To address this, we need to search through Django's model and migration files to find where the default parameter is being processed and how nested class methods are handled.",
