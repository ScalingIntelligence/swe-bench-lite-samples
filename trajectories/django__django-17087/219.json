The problematic code is in a model class (Profile) and a nested class (Capability) within that model. The default method of the Capability class is being assigned to the default parameter of an ArrayField. This assignment is incorrect and causes the migration generation to fail. To identify the root cause and fix, we need to find the exact place where the ArrayField is defined within the mentioned models. We should search for the specific model classes and their nested classes that involve this problematic behavior.",

The search results contain various files related to Django's migration system, but none directly address the issue of referencing nested class methods in field defaults. However, the 'django/db/migrations/writer.py' file contains the 'AddField' operation serialization logic, which might be relevant for understanding how field defaults are handled during migration creation. The 'OperationWriter.serialize' method could potentially be involved in how default values for fields are serialized into the migration file. This might provide clues on how to fix the issue by correctly serializing the default value to the appropriate nested class method.",
