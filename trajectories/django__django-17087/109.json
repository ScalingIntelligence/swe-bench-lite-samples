This code span includes the definition of the ArrayField class and its __init__ method, where the base_field and size parameters are defined, and the default parameter is set up.

The issue involves a Django model with a nested class 'Capability' and a class method 'default' being used as the default value for an 'ArrayField' in the 'Profile' model. The key problem is the incorrect reference in the migration file, which is not directly addressed in the initial search results. To refine the search, we need to explore deeper into the migration handling and default value validations in Django's model fields and migrations framework. The search should now focus on the interaction between model fields, their default values, and the migrations generated by Django. This includes looking into the Django core modules responsible for handling migrations and ensuring that default values are correctly inferred during the migration process.",
