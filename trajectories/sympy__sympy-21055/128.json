It also calls `_eval_refine()` if the method is available for the expression. In the same file, `_refine_reim()` specifically handles refinement of complex expanded expressions.\n\nSecond, in `sympy/matrices/common.py`, the `MatrixOperations` class has a `refine()` method that applies refinement on each element of the matrix.\n\nThird, in `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `Basic` class has a `refine()` method that delegates refinement to the global `refine()` function.\n\nLastly, in `sympy/polys/rootisolation.py`, the `ComplexInterval` class has a `refine()` method for isolating complex roots.\n\nGiven the issue, the focus should be on the main `refine()` function and its interaction with complex expressions and specific assumptions like positivity, which need to be handled more intelligently for desired simplifications.",

Specifically, the issue demonstrates that the `refine()` function does not simplify the `arg()` function for a positive argument, even though it should. This indicates a problem in how the `refine()` function handles assumptions for complex or real-valued arguments.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, the relevant code spans are primarily located in the `refine.py` file under the `sympy/assumptions` directory. This file contains the core logic for the `refine()` function and its associated handlers like `refine_re()`, `refine_im()`, and `_refine_reim()`. The analysis of these code spans shows that the `refine()` function checks for assumptions about whether an argument is real or imaginary and takes action accordingly. However, it does not directly handle assumptions about the positivity or negativity of the argument, which is the core issue identified.\n\nGiven the context and the search results, it becomes clear that the main area of concern for fixing this issue is the `refine()` function and its handlers in `refine.py`.
