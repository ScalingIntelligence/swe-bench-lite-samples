Specifically, the examples provided show that `refine()` does not simplify the arg function to 0 even when it's assumed to be positive. This suggests that the `_eval_refine` method or the refine_abs, refine_Pow functions need adjustments to handle these cases better.\n\nUpon examining the code spans:\n- The `refine` function initializes refinement of an expression and traverses through its arguments.\n- `refine_abs` and `refine_Pow` both handle the refinement of Abs and Pow respectively. The relevance of `refine_abs` is clear as it should handle the case when the absolute value is refined under the assumption of positivity.\n- `refine_Pow` is relevant because it's supposed to simplify powers based on assumptions, which is a part of the issue description.\n\nThese functions align with the reported issue as they are directly responsible for handling refinement of specific types of expressions, which the user finds inadequate for real numbers under positive assumptions.",
