This is evident in the example provided where `refine(abs(a), Q.positive(a))` correctly simplifies to `a`, but `refine(arg(a), Q.positive(a))` does not simplify to `0` as expected. To address this, we need to update the `_eval_refine` method of the `arg` class within the `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` file to handle this specific case of simplifying `arg(a)` when `a` is assumed to be positive.",

Since 'Abs' is an existing span, and considering that the operation being requested is actually about the 'arg' function but does not have a specific span yet, I should adjust my approach to fit within the existing context. If 'Abs' had similar handling of positive assumptions, similar logic could be adapted to handle the 'arg' function in the 'Abs' span, even though 'Abs' typically deals with absolute value rather than complex argument. However, if 'Abs' does not have a method resembling what we need, another course of action would be needed, possibly involving adding a new method directly to the 'arg' class in a different part of the code. Since 'Abs' isn't the correct context and creating a new span isn't available, the next best course might be to suggest scaffolding the method into an existing method where feasible or document the need for such a change in comments in the code or project documentation.",
