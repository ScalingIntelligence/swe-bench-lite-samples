Specifically, it does not recognize that the argument functions simplify for real numbers when using `Integral` and `sin(x)*exp(-a*x)`. The search should focus on the `refine` function and its associated methods in the `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` file, and also look into how the `Integral` class and its methods are handled in `sympy/integrals/integrals.py` and related files. Additionally, investigating the `Piecewise` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` might be relevant due to its appearance in the provided example.",
