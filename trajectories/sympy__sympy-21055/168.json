The user provides examples where `refine()` does not simplify expressions involving `arg(a)` even when `a` is known to be positive. This suggests that the issue might be with the `refine_arg` function or the `refine` function's handling of `arg`.\n\n2. Reviewing the current file context in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, there are several relevant functions identified such as `refine`, `refine_abs`, `refine_Pow`, `_refine_reim`, and `refine_sign`. However, there is no specific handler for `arg` mentioned, which suggests that `refine` might not have a specific implementation for simplifying the `arg` function.\n\n3. Examining the new search results, particularly in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`, there are definitions for the `arg` function and its evaluation (`arg.eval`). This suggests that the implementation might be more relevant to the issue at hand. Additionally, there is a `refine_abs` function in the file context which aids in understanding how `refine` might handle absolute values.\n\n4. The `refine_Pow` function in the file context and the `Pow._eval_refine` function in the search results also provide insights into how powers are handled during refinement. This could be relevant as the user's example involves powers and trigonometric functions.\n\nGiven these observations, it seems that the missing piece could be a `refine_arg` function or an update to the existing `refine` logic to incorporate knowledge about the `arg` function and its simplification under certain assumptions (like knowing that `a` is positive).\n\nThus, the identified spans that are relevant to the reported issue are those that deal with the `refine` function, the `arg` function, and other complex handling functions like `refine_abs` and `refine_Pow` that might influence or need an update to properly handle expressions involving `arg`.",
