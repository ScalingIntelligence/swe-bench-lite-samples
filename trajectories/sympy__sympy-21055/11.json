In 'sympy/assumptions/refine.py', the `refine` function is defined, which iterates through the arguments of the expression and applies refinement. The `_refine_reim` function is also present, which refines expressions expanded in complex form. These functions are likely where improvements or fixes need to be made to address the issue with simplifying complex arguments. In 'sympy/core/basic.py', the `Basic` class has a `refine` method that uses the refine function from the assumptions module.

However, the search results lack the `refine_re` and `refine_im` functions that were present in the initial context, indicating a gap in the current search results. This suggests that while the `refine` function and the `_refine_reim` function are important, they alone do not provide enough context to fully address the issue without the specialized refiners for real and imaginary parts.
