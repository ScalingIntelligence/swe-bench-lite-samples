There are specific examples provided where `refine()` fails to simplify expressions involving `a` when it is asserted to be positive. This suggests that the refinement logic for certain functions like `Integral`, `Piecewise`, `abs`, and `arg` might not be handling the assumptions correctly. The files provided hint at where the refinement logic is implemented for different types of expressions. The search should focus on these refinement handlers and the assumptions handling within them.",

The `Integral` class, for instance, handles assumptions through its `doit` method, which considers various conditions like 'piecewise', 'separate', and 'none'. The `Abs` class has a detailed `eval` method that simplifies expressions involving absolute values, especially handling cases with complex numbers and infinite expressions. The `refine` function in the context provided iterates over the expression's arguments and applies refinements based on existing handlers or by directly evaluating if the expression has an `_eval_refine` method. This approach allows for a detailed examination of each part of the expression under given assumptions. However, the provided context lacks specific handling details for the `_eval_refine` method in the `Piecewise` and `arg` classes, which would be crucial for understanding how they refine expressions under assumptions like `Q.positive(a)`.",
