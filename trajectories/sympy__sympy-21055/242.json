I need to identify code spans relevant to the refine(), Piecewise, and assumptions handling to see if improvements can be made or if there's an existing strategy for handling such cases.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant spans from different files. I'll start by examining sympy/assumptions/refine.py since it directly mentions the refine function and its handling of assumptions. I'll also inspect sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py for the Piecewise class and related methods, as the refine function might interact with Piecewise under certain conditions. Additionally, I'll look at sympy/assumptions/relation/equality.py and binrel.py to understand how assumptions are handled with binary relations, such as equality and inequality predicates, which might be relevant when refining statements involving such relations.\n\n1. In sympy/assumptions/refine.py, the refine function itself is defined, and it iterates over its arguments, refining them under the given assumptions. This looks directly related to the issue. \n\n2. In sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py, there are definitions for how to handle inequalities and simplify arguments for Piecewise functions. These could be useful if the refine function needs to interact with Piecewise objects in a more sophisticated way to handle complex arguments as described in the issue.\n\n3. In sympy/assumptions/relation/equality.py and binrel.py, there are classes and methods for dealing with binary relations under assumptions, which is relevant because the simplify functionality may depend on how these relations are evaluated or simplified.\n\nGiven the provided code spans, I believe the identification of relevant code spans can proceed based on addressing the reported issue with the refine() function not simplifying under complex assumptions.",
