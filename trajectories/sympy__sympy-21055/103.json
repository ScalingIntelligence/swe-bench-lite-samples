If the argument is negative, it returns the negated argument.\n2. **refine_Pow**: This function refines powers of expressions under given assumptions. However, it doesn't seem directly relevant to the issue of refining `arg(a)`.\n3. **refine_re** and **refine_im**: These functions refine the real and imaginary parts of expressions, respectively. They are not directly related to the issue either.\n4. **_refine_reim**: This helper function is used by `refine_re` and `refine_im` to refine expressions after expanding them.].\n5. **refine_sign**: This function refines the sign of an expression under given assumptions. It is not directly relevant to the issue of refining `arg(a)`.\n\nThe key point from the user's issue is about refining `arg(a)` when `a` is positive, and this functionality does not seem to be covered by the provided code spans.

By examining the provided search results, it becomes clear that the relevant code spans are located in the 'refine_abs', 'refine_Pow', 'refine_re', 'refine_im', and 'refine_sign' functions, all of which are dedicated to refining expressions under specific assumptions. These functions use the 'ask' method from the 'sympy.assumptions' module to query properties of symbolic expressions, which is a critical element for addressing the reported issue. The 'refine_abs' function handles the refinement of absolute values given certain assumptions about its argument, such as whether it is real and non-negative. Similarly, 'refine_Pow' deals with expressions involving powers, and the other mentioned functions handle real, imaginary parts, and signum functions. Given these functionalities, it is clear that these code spans are directly related to the 'refine()' function's capabilities and limitations raised in the issue.
