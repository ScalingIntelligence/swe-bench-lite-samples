Additionally, potential interplay with the `Piecewise` class from `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` should be considered as `refine()` seems to return `Piecewise` expressions that are not simplified as expected.

In the search results, the `refine` and `refine_abs` spans are relevant as they directly relate to the `refine()` function's handling of expressions. Additionally, the `Piecewise` class and its methods in `piecewise.py` are relevant because `refine()` often deals with expressions that can be simplified into piecewise forms. The `MatrixOperations.refine` span in `common.py` is also relevant as it shows how the `refine()` function is applied to matrices, which might be needed for a broader understanding or future implementations. However, the `ComplexInterval.refine` in `rootisolation.py` is not directly relevant as it deals with complex intervals and not directly related to simplifying real-number arguments.

To address the issue with the `refine()` function not simplifying the `arg` function for positive real numbers, further steps should involve a thorough search across other relevant files within the SymPy project. The search should focus on identifying implementations or related logic handling the `arg` function and its interactions with the `refine` function under specific assumptions like positive real numbers. Key search terms might include 'refine function arg positive real', 'sympy arg refinement', 'sympy refine assumptions', among others.
