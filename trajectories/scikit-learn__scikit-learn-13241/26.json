The __init__ method initializes the KernelPCA object with parameters including n_components, kernel, and copy_X, all of which are directly related to the issue. The _get_kernel method is responsible for generating the kernel matrix using the specified kernel type, which is crucial for understanding how the 'rbf' kernel might be affecting the results. Lastly, the fit_transform method, being the central method for applying the PCA transformation, demonstrates the process of fitting and transforming the data based on the kernel matrix.
