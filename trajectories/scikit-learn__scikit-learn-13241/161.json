A key aspect of this problem is understanding why signs might differ when performing PCA on the same dataset multiple times. Upon reviewing the existing code in the scikit-learn library, specifically in the KernelPCA class, it becomes apparent that there's no explicit handling or normalization of signs in the PCA transformation process. This might explain why results differ in signs. The newly identified code span in sklearn/utils/extmath.py, specifically the svd_flip function, deals with adjusting the signs of vectors returned by SVD. This function adjusts signs based on the absolute maximum value of each vector, ensuring consistent orientations. Given the context of the PCA implementation in sklearn, the svd_flip function may be pertinent to apply after the eigendecomposition in KernelPCA to ensure sign consistency across different runs.",
