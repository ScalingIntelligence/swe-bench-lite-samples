This suggests that the orientation of the principal components varies unpredictably. To resolve this, it's crucial to investigate the KernelPCA class and its methods, particularly where orientation changes could occur, such as in the _fit_transform method or any other method that involves kernel computations. Additionally, looking into the extmath module and its functions like svd_flip, which is responsible for fixing the sign of singular vectors, might be necessary. Given the potential impact, a review of how these operations are handled in other decomposition methods (like PCA) could also be beneficial.",
