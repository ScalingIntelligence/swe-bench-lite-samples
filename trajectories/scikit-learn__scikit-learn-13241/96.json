This suggests an investigation into the KernelPCA class and associated methods, particularly focusing on the fit_transform and _fit_transform methods, which handle the transformation logic. Additionally, the _get_kernel method might be relevant due to its role in computing the kernel matrix. Given the nature of the problem, it's also essential to ensure that the kernel calculations respect reproducibility in sign assignments. Therefore, examining the kernel computation and eigenvector sign handling in the library could provide insights. The file patterns should focus on the decomposition module where KernelPCA is likely implemented. The specific code snippet for 'pca = KernelPCA(n_components=7, kernel='rbf', copy_X=False, n_jobs=-1)' should also be found to understand the exact configuration under which the issue arises.",

From the provided code, the main concern is with the `fit`, `fit_transform`, `transform`, and `inverse_transform` methods within the KernelPCA class, as these are responsible for the transformation and inverse transformation of data. Additionally, the initialization of the KernelPCA class (`__init__` method) is considered as it sets parameters for the kernel and solver. The other file, `sklearn/utils/extmath.py`, contains utility functions like `randomized_range_finder`, `randomized_svd`, and `svd_flip`, which are relevant because they handle the underlying SVD computations. The `svd_flip` function, in particular, can directly influence the sign of the output components. Given this analysis, the relevant code spans include the entire KernelPCA class for context and the utility functions for understanding the computations affecting the results.

The '_fit_transform' method is particularly relevant as it handles eigen decomposition, which directly influences the signs of the resulting components. Since the search results show the complete implementation of KernelPCA, including its constructor, internal methods, and public methods, we have a comprehensive view to diagnose or modify the relevant parts related to sign consistency without needing further search.",
