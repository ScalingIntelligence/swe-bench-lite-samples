The issue specifically points to differences in signs when using the fit_transform method of KernelPCA. Thus, the relevant code spans should be those that deal with the computation and possibly the sign determination during the transformation process.\n\n1. Reviewed the KernelPCA class and its fit_transform method to understand how the transformation is computed and if there is any potential for sign flipping.\n2. Noted the multiplication with self.alphas_ and np.sqrt(self.lambdas_), which might be where the sign differences arise if self.alphas_ contains negative values.\n3. Considered the code snippets for PCA and TruncatedSVD for context, but they are not directly relevant as the issue pertains specifically to KernelPCA.\n4. Reviewed utils functions like svd_flip for potential use within KernelPCA, but KernelPCA does not seem to directly use these functions based on the provided code spans.\n5. Determined that the most relevant code spans are from the KernelPCA class where the fit_transform method is implemented.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclusively identify the KernelPCA class and its fit_transform method as the relevant code spans for the reported issue.",
