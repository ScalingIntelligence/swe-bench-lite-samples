To investigate this, we should focus on the KernelPCA class in the sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py file, which is likely where the dimension reduction logic is implemented. Additionally, understanding how the kernel and subsequent transformations are handled could provide insights. The presence of the '_fit_transform' method in the KernelPCA class and similar methods in other decomposition classes (like PCA) suggest that these are key points to investigate for the underlying logic of data transformations.",

The code provided uses KernelPCA with the RBF kernel, setting `n_components` to 7, `copy_X` to False, and `n_jobs` to -1. To match these, I need to find the initialization of `KernelPCA`, its implementation for `fit_transform`, and how the kernel matrix is handled. From the provided search results, I see that the file 'sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py' contains the `KernelPCA` class with methods for initialization, kernel calculation, and transformation. The relevant spans appear to be the initialization of `KernelPCA` (`KernelPCA.__init__`), the kernel calculation method (`KernelPCA._get_kernel`), and the transformation method (`KernelPCA.fit_transform`). These spans cover the settings of the PCA, how the RBF kernel is applied, and the transformation process, which directly relate to the issue.

Although the detailed logic for eigenvector scaling and the potential causes of sign variability in results are not explicitly shown in the provided '_fit_transform' method snippet, the presence of these methods and their involvement in handling kernel computations and transformations indicate that the relevant file context for addressing the issue is likely present.
