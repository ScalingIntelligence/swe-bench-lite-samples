This suggests that the direction of the principal components might be arbitrary due to the nature of eigenvector sign. The relevant files seem to be focused around `kernel_pca.py`, which contains the implementation of KernelPCA. To further investigate this issue, a more specific search should target the `KernelPCA` class methods that involve transformation directly. Additionally, investigating common utility functions such as `svd_flip` in `extmath.py` can provide insights into how the sign of vectors is handled after decomposition. The primary focus should be on the transformation logic in KernelPCA and related stability checks.",

This suggests that the algorithm's output changes between runs, despite the input being the same. To address this, I focused on the KernelPCA class and its methods, particularly _fit_transform and fit_transform, which are crucial for the transformation process. Additionally, I noticed the svd_flip function in the sklearn/utils/extmath.py file, which is responsible for flipping the signs of vectors to ensure deterministic output. This function could be related to the issue of varying signs in the results. Therefore, these code spans directly address the problem by providing the logic for how components are computed and how their signs are managed.",
