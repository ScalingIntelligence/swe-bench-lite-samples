The provided search results include the KernelPCA class definition, its initialization method (__init__), and key methods for computing the kernel (_get_kernel), fitting and transforming the data (_fit_transform, fit, fit_transform). These methods involve the computation and transformation of data based on the kernel, which aligns with the issue's focus on the dimension reduction process and the kernel used. The code spans within these methods are directly relevant to understanding and resolving the issue of differing signs in the results.
