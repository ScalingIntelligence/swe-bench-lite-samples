Given that the signs of eigenvectors can be arbitrary, it's important to analyze the code span where KernelPCA calculates the eigenvectors (eigen_solver='dense' or 'arpack'). The code snippet includes the __init__ function where parameters like n_components, kernel, and fit_inverse_transform are initialized, along with the _fit_transform function where eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed. These parts of the code are crucial because they deal with the core functionality of KernelPCA, which is to transform data into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel and then reduce its dimensionality by finding eigenvectors. Specifically, the focus should be on the handling of eigenvectors, particularly after their computation, to understand if there's any process in place that could lead to changes in signs across different runs without changing the actual data being processed.
