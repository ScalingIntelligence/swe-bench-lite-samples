It is crucial to understand that the signs of principal components in PCA are not uniquely determined due to the nature of eigenvectors. When eigenvectors are normalized, one can simply multiply them by -1, leading to the same eigenvalues. This explains the observed behavior where the signs of results can vary. To address this, we need to focus on the code relevant to KernelPCA and RBF kernel implementation.

Additionally, `sklearn/gaussian_process/kernels.py` contains the implementation of the RBF kernel, which is used in the KernelPCA method. This section is relevant as it shows how the RBF kernel is applied and might provide insights into why sign differences occur during transformation. Given this analysis, the relevant code spans are: `KernelPCA.__init__`, `KernelPCA._fit_transform`, `KernelPCA.fit`, `KernelPCA.fit_transform` from `sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py` and `RBF.__call__` from `sklearn/gaussian_process/kernels.py`.",
