The `fit` method processes the kernel matrix and performs the eigen decomposition. The `fit_transform` method uses these eigen vectors and eigen values to transform the input data. Given the nature of the issue, where results differ only in signs, it suggests a non-deterministic behavior in the eigen decomposition or the selection of eigen vectors, which could be influenced by factors such as the order of input data or inherent properties of the eigen solver used. It is essential to ensure that the eigen solver and its parameters are consistent and that the data preprocessing steps do not introduce variability in the kernel matrix.
