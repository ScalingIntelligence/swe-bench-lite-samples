This difference in signs without a change in magnitudes is a common occurrence in PCA-based methods due to the inherent indeterminacy in the signs of eigenvectors. The search should focus on the KernelPCA class and its methods to understand how the eigenvectors are computed and transformed. Additionally, looking at the utilities or helper functions for eigenvector sign flipping or normalization can provide insights into the consistency of results. It's possible that changes in how the sign is handled might affect the results.",

The key code spans to look for are where KernelPCA is defined, specifically the __init__, _fit_transform, fit, fit_transform, and transform methods, as these are directly related to the computations and transformations of data in KernelPCA. Also, methods like _pairwise, _get_kernel, and _fit_inverse_transform could be of interest to understand how kernels are handled and transformed. Additionally, the svd_flip function in the extmath module might be relevant as it deals with sign flipping in singular value decomposition, which could be impacting the signs of PCA results. No other code sections appear directly related to KernelPCA based on the issue report. Therefore, the relevant identified code spans are sufficient for addressing the issue. Analyzing the identified spans should suffice to understand and potentially address the issue of differing signs in PCA results.",
