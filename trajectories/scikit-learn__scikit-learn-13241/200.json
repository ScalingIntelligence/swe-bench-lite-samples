The 'sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py' file is highly relevant as it directly contains the KernelPCA class definition and methods, including '__init__', '_get_kernel', '_fit_transform', 'fit', 'fit_transform', 'transform', and 'inverse_transform'. These methods are central to how KernelPCA handles data transformation and could be the source of the sign differences. Additionally, the 'sklearn/utils/extmath.py' file contains utilities that may affect the stability of the results, such as 'svd_flip' and '_deterministic_vector_sign_flip', which may impact the sign of eigenvectors.
