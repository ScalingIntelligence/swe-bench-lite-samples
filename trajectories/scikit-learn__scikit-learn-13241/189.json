The relevant files to investigate could include those related to the KernelPCA class and its interactions with other classes and functions, particularly where the directionality could be influenced, such as in the calculation of principal components or during transformations. Given the contextual files provided, focusing on the 'sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py' file is crucial for understanding the implementation of KernelPCA. Additional insights could be found by examining the utility functions in 'sklearn/utils/extmath.py', as they might be involved in handling sign flipping or vector normalization. Searching for occurrences of 'KernelPCA', 'fit_transform', and '_fit_transform' within the 'sklearn/decomposition/' directory could yield further insights into the processing steps potentially affecting sign consistency.",

Additionally, there is a mention of the `svd_flip` function in `sklearn/utils/extmath.py`, which could potentially affect the sign of the components.
