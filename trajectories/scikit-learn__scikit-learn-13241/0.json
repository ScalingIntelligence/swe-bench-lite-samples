To address this, we need to investigate the methods within the KernelPCA class responsible for fitting and transforming the data. We should ensure that the eigendecomposition process is consistent and correct. It's possible that the sign differences are due to the nature of the eigenvectors which are only defined up to a sign (both + and - are valid). To resolve this, we might need to normalize or standardize the signs of the eigenvectors. However, we need to carefully examine the current implementation to pinpoint the exact line or method causing the inconsistency.",
