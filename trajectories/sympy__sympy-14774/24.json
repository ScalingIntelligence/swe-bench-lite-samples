However, a closer look at the code reveals that the 'inv_trig_table' mentioned in the issue is actually defined in the global scope just before the class definition.

Specifically, the setting 'inv_trig_style' is set to 'abbreviated' by default, which suggests that there might be a mechanism to switch between abbreviated and full names. Since the issue is about the 'full' style not working as expected for 'acsc' and 'asec', it is likely that the 'inv_trig_table' or related mapping function is defined elsewhere within the 'LatexPrinter' class or in a method that it calls. Refining the search parameters to include these aspects can lead to finding the necessary code span.",

The issue provides an example where `latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` works as expected but `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` does not, suggesting a fix to modify `sympy/printing/latex.py`. This suggests we need to focus on the LaTeX printing functionality and the handling of inverse trigonometric functions. The provided search results include relevant files such as `sympy/printing/latex.py`, `sympy/integrals/rubi/rules/inverse_trig.py`, and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`. In `sympy/printing/latex.py`, we should look for the `inv_trig_table` and how it handles inverse trigonometric functions. In `sympy/integrals/rubi/rules/inverse_trig.py`, we should check for patterns and rules involving inverse trigonometric functions. Lastly, in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, we should review the definitions and methods for inverse trigonometric functions like `asin`, `acos`, etc. Based on the issue, we specifically need to identify the code spans that deal with the `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` option and the mapping of inverse trigonometric functions to their full LaTeX names.",
