The 'inv_trig_style' parameter seems to affect how these functions are printed in LaTeX. The example provided shows that 'asin(x)' with 'inv_trig_style=\"full\"' returns '\\arcsin{\\left (x \\right )}', as expected. However, 'acsc(x)' with the same style returns '\\operatorname{acsc}{\\left (x \\right )}' instead of '\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'. This discrepancy suggests a need to update the 'inv_trig_table' in the LaTeX printer to include 'acsc' and 'asec'. In light of this, the line that needs modification is identified to be around line 743 in the file 'sympy/printing/latex.py'.",

Upon examining the provided search results, I found the relevant part of the code within the 'LatexPrinter' class where the 'inv_trig_table' list is defined and where the LaTeX names are processed based on the 'inv_trig_style' setting. This part of the code includes the '_print_Function' method where the list 'inv_trig_table' is currently defined with the elements 'asin', 'acos', 'atan', 'acot'. It is this list that needs to be updated to include 'acsc' and 'asec' to address the reported issue.",
