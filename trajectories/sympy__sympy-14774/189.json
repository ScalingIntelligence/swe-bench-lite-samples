The printer does not print the full names of these functions when the 'inv_trig_style' is set to 'full'. For example, it should print '\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\left (x \\right )}' instead of '\\operatorname{acsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'. The relevant code for the LaTeX printer seems to be in 'sympy/printing/latex.py'. A potential fix is suggested by adjusting the 'inv_trig_table' in this file. Therefore, the search should focus on this specific file and the 'inv_trig_table' variable within it.",
