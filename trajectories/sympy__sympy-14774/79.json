From the examples provided, it's clear that the printer does not convert 'acsc' to 'arccsc' and 'asec' to 'arcsec' as expected when 'inv_trig_style' is set to 'full'. Given the nature of the issue and the provided example of the proposed fix in `latex.py`, it's evident that the relevant code should be around lines related to inverse trigonometric functions in the LaTeX printer. Since the fix is proposed to be made to `inv_trig_table` in `latex.py`, focusing on that specific file and searching for related variables or methods would be the most efficient approach. The search parameters should target the keyword 'inv_trig_table' and the specific context given in the issue. Also, since 'acsc' and 'asec' are involved, these terms should be included for better accuracy in the search.",
