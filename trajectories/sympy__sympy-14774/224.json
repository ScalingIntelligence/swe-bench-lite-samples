From the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant code is located within the 'LatexPrinter' class in 'sympy/printing/latex.py'. The relevant method is '_print_Function' which handles the printing of functions in LaTeX format. The key part of the code is the 'inv_trig_table', which is currently defined to include ['asin', 'acos', 'atan', 'acot'], leading to the issue.
