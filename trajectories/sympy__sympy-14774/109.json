The example provided shows that while 'asin' correctly transforms to '\\arcsin' when 'inv_trig_style' is set to 'full', 'acsc' does not transform to '\\arccsc' as expected. Instead, it retains its original form. The suggested fix involves modifying the 'inv_trig_table' in the LatexPrinter class to include 'acsc' and 'asec'. Reviewing the provided search results, I found the relevant code in the LatexPrinter class under the _print_Function method. Specifically, the 'inv_trig_table' list needs to be updated to include 'acsc' and 'asec'. This change should ensure that 'acsc' and 'asec' transform correctly to '\\arccsc' and '\\arccsec' respectively when 'inv_trig_style' is set to 'full'. Additionally, the _print_Function method itself is where the transformation logic is applied based on the contents of 'inv_trig_table'. Given this analysis, I have identified the relevant code spans within the search results.",
