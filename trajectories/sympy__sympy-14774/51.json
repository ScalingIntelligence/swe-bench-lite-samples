This is evidenced by the example provided, where 'latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")' should return '\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\left (x \\right )}', but instead returns '\\operatorname{acsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'. The suggested fix involves modifying the 'inv_trig_table' in the LatexPrinter class of the 'sympy/printing/latex.py' file to include 'acsc' and 'asec'. The search results provide the relevant code section from the LatexPrinter class, particularly focusing on the '_print_Function' method where the 'inv_trig_table' is defined and used. This table currently includes 'asin', 'acos', 'atan', and 'acot', but lacks 'acsc' and 'asec', which directly corresponds to the issue described. Thus, the identified code span (id='LatexPrinter._print_Function') is relevant, and the search task can be considered complete based on the provided search results.",
