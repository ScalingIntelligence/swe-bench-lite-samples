The suggested fix involves updating the 'inv_trig_table' list in the LatexPrinter class to include 'acsc' and 'asec'. This matches the description of the issue and the tentative solution presented. The relevant code span can be found in the LatexPrinter's _print_Function method where the 'inv_trig_table' list is defined.
