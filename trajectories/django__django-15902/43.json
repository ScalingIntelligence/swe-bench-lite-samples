The search results provide insights into the ManagementForm class and its usage within BaseFormSet. It shows how the ManagementForm is constructed to handle form management data such as TOTAL_FORMS, INITIAL_FORMS, MIN_NUM_FORMS, and MAX_NUM_FORMS. Also, it outlines the clean method of the ManagementForm which prepares the form data and the cached_property of the management form within the BaseFormSet class. Given the context, the ManagementForm and its methods, particularly the clean method and the initialization in the BaseFormSet, are directly relevant to what's causing the deprecation warning in the user's project.",
