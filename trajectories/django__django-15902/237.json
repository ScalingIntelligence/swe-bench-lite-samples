The search results provide a comprehensive look into the `django/forms/formsets.py` file, which contains several code spans that are directly related to the management form functionality. Notably, the `ManagementForm` class and its methods `clean` are crucial as they define the management form and its validation process. Additionally, the `BaseFormSet` class and its method `management_form` are highly relevant as they handle the management form within the context of formsets. The `initial_form_count` method within `BaseFormSet` is also relevant as it deals with the initial form count. All these spans are directly involved in the functionality that may be causing the deprecation warning. Therefore, these code spans are likely to be the key areas to investigate and possibly modify to address the deprecation warning.",
