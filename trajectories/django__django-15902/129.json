            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns a deprecation warning related to the 'default.html' template being raised for ManagementForm's, even though the forms are not being rendered using the '{{ form }}' expression directly. The key points from the issue are the deprecation warning and the need to determine if special handling is needed for management forms to avoid the warning. The provided search results include relevant code spans from several Django form-related files. In 'django/forms/utils.py', the 'RenderableMixin' class and its 'render' method are significant as they handle template rendering and issue a warning when the 'default.html' template is used, which aligns with the deprecation warning mentioned in the issue. In 'django/forms/formsets.py', the 'ManagementForm' class and the 'BaseFormSet' class are relevant as they deal with form management and may also be involved in the warning for management forms. Additionally, the 'ManagementForm' class itself could be a direct source of the reported deprecation warning. In 'django/forms/forms.py', the 'BaseForm' class and related methods are also considered relevant because they handle form rendering and could be indirectly related to the issue through interactions with formsets or management forms.\n\nReviewing these sections of code, especially the 'RenderableMixin.render' method in 'django/forms/utils.py' and the 'ManagementForm' class in 'django/forms/formsets.py', seems crucial for understanding and addressing the reported deprecation warning. These code spans directly involve the logic behind template handling and management form functionality, making them highly relevant to the issue. Therefore, identifying these spans as relevant should be considered complete for this search task.",
