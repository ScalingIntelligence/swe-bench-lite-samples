The warning is due to the management form production, which produces hidden inputs and thus does not require a visible template. The focus should be on the management form functionality in the BaseFormSet class and how it interacts with the templates.\n\nAnalyzing the search results: \n1. In `django/forms/forms.py`, the search results highlight the `BaseForm` class which sets various template names like `template_name_div`, `template_name_p`, etc., indicating handling of different form rendering templates. \n2. The `BaseForm._html_output` method specifically has a deprecation warning about using `_html_output` instead of `render()` and `get_context()`. This directly pertains to the deprecation issue.\n3. In `django/forms/formsets.py`, the `BaseFormSet.management_form` method is crucial as it deals with the management of form sets, which is central to the issue because it manages the form rendering without need of the 'default.html' template.\n4. Other sections like `ModelAdmin.render_change_form` in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` and `InlineModelAdmin.get_formset` also potentially affect how forms are rendered or managed within admin interfaces, which might indirectly relate to the issue.\n\nThe identified spans cover the relevant code for managing forms, particularly the handling of management forms and template deprecations. The spans in `django/forms/forms.py` and `django/forms/formsets.py` are most pertinent to the reported issue, focusing on how forms are rendered and managed.",
