This warning impacts the project even when forms are not rendered using the {{ form }} expression. The key focus is on identifying code related to ManagementForm, BaseFormSet, and how these classes handle form management and rendering.\n\n1. **Analysis of Search Results:**\n   - **django/forms/forms.py:** Contains BaseForm, which initializes form attributes and settings. Notably, the get_context method includes logic for handling form errors and preparing rendering context, which might be relevant if the template deprecation is related to how errors are presented.\n   - **django/forms/formsets.py:** This file is crucial as it contains the ManagementForm class and BaseFormSet class. The ManagementForm class definition and its clean method are relevant as they directly handle the management form's data cleaning.\n     - The BaseFormSet class includes methods like __init__, management_form, which are integral to formset management and would be critical if modifications to avoid the deprecation warning are necessary.\n   - **django/contrib/admin/options.py:** Contains ModelAdmin and InlineModelAdmin classes, which use formsets for inline model administration. While not directly tied to the deprecation warning of ManagementForm, they demonstrate how formsets are integrated into complex admin interfaces, potentially guiding the solution landscape.\n\n2. **Relevant Code Spans Identification:**\n   - **ManagementForm:** The class definition in django/forms/formsets.py and its clean method are directly tied to the management form, making them highly relevant.\n   - **BaseFormSet:** The entire class and its methods are relevant as they manage the formsets, including handling logical parts like form submission, initialization, and the context of management forms.\n   - Although the ModelAdmin and InlineModelAdmin are not causing the deprecation warning, they help grasp the broader context of where and how ManagementForm is used in a Django project.\n\n3. **Decision to Use Only Relevant Codes:**\n   Given the nature of the issue, the search results need to focus only on the code spans directly related to the deprecation warning of ManagementForm. This ensures the solution is targeted and does not expand into unnecessary areas of project administration or unrelated form handling.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans are those within django/forms/formsets.py that directly deal with ManagementForm and BaseFormSet, critical for addressing the specific deprecation warning reported.",
