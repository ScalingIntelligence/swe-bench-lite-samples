The focus of the issue is on whether it's worth avoiding this warning specifically for management forms, which only produce hidden inputs and whose template usage is insignificant in this context.\n\nReviewing the search results from 'django/forms/formsets.py', the relevant code spans are:\n1. The 'ManagementForm' class definition which includes the fields TOTAL_FORMS, INITIAL_FORMS, MIN_NUM_FORMS, and MAX_NUM_FORMS, all using HiddenInput.\n2. The 'clean' method within the 'ManagementForm' class, which sets default values for TOTAL_FORM_COUNT and INITIAL_FORM_COUNT.\n3. The 'BaseFormSet' class and specifically the 'management_form' method, which initializes the ManagementForm based on the formset's state (bound or not).\n\nThese spans are directly related to the creation and handling of management forms, which are central to the issue at hand.
