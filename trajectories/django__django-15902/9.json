Specifically, the ManagementForm class includes attributes TOTAL_FORMS, INITIAL_FORMS, MIN_NUM_FORMS, and MAX_NUM_FORMS, all of which are IntegerFields with HiddenInput widgets. This aligns with the issue's description that only hidden inputs are produced, which is relevant because the deprecation warning is being raised regardless. The ManagementForm's clean method also sets default values for TOTAL_FORM_COUNT and INITIAL_FORM_COUNT, which could be related to the formset's management and might need special handling to avoid the deprecation warning. Additionally, the BaseFormSet class includes a management_form method that initializes the ManagementForm and could be a point of intervention for avoiding the deprecation warning. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of the ManagementForm's design and usage, and they are directly related to the issue at hand.",
