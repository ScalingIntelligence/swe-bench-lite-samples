The warning is still produced due to the formset management form production, which only produces hidden inputs. The question is whether it's worth special-casing this to avoid producing the warning for management forms.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, the key components related to the issue are found in the django/forms/formsets.py file. This file contains the `ManagementForm` class, which is responsible for the formset management and includes fields like TOTAL_FORMS, INITIAL_FORMS, MIN_NUM_FORMS, and MAX_NUM_FORMS, all of which use HiddenInput. The `BaseFormSet` class also appears relevant, as it includes a cached_property for the management_form.\n\nThe django/contrib/admin/options.py file also contains relevant code, particularly the `ModelAdmin` and `InlineModelAdmin` classes, which handle rendering and management of forms in the Django admin interface. These classes interact with the `ManagementForm` and are potential areas where the deprecation warning could originate.\n\nGiven the issue's focus on the ManagementForm and the formset management in Django, the identified code spans from both files seem relevant. They provide the necessary context to understand how the ManagementForm is used and how the formsets are managed in Django, which is crucial for addressing the deprecation warning issue.",
