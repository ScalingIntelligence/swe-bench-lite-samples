The user is specifically concerned about the management form being rendered with hidden inputs only, leading to the deprecation warning even though forms are not rendered with {{ form }} expression in their project. \n\nThe search results provide insights into the relevant parts of the Django codebase potentially related to this issue. The file 'django/forms/formsets.py' contains the definition of the `ManagementForm` class, which includes fields like TOTAL_FORMS, INITIAL_FORMS, MIN_NUM_FORMS, and MAX_NUM_FORMS, all rendered as HiddenInput. Additionally, it includes the `clean` method for the `ManagementForm`, and the `management_form` method in the `BaseFormSet` class. This section of code seems directly relevant to the management of formsets and the deprecation warning related to 'default.html'. \n\nMoreover, the file 'django/forms/forms.py' contains the `BaseForm` class and related methods, such as `_html_output`, which uses a deprecation warning. This suggests that changes in this area could influence how forms, including management forms, are rendered and affect the deprecation warnings. \n\nLastly, 'django/forms/renderers.py' includes the `BaseRenderer` class and its subclasses, which handle the rendering of template names and context. Since the deprecation issue might be related to the usage of specific templates, understanding this part of the codebase is also crucial. \n\nOverall, these sections appear to cover the potential areas affected by the deprecation warning related to 'default.html' and management forms, making them highly relevant to addressing the user's issue.",
