The main focus is to understand where and how this deprecation warning is being triggered and whether it's necessary to handle management forms differently to avoid this warning.\n\nFrom the search results, we can see that the ManagementForm class is defined in 'django/forms/formsets.py', which includes integer fields with HiddenInput widgets. This class also has a 'clean' method that sets default values for total and initial form counts. Additionally, the BaseFormSet class uses this ManagementForm within its 'management_form' method.\n\nAnother relevant part is found in 'django/forms/utils.py', where the DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_DEPRECATION_MSG is defined, and the RenderableMixin class has a 'render' method that warns about the usage of 'default.html' templates. This method checks the template name and issues a deprecation warning if it matches 'django/forms/default.html' or 'django/forms/formsets/default.html'.\n\nThese sections of the code are directly related to the issue as they involve the ManagementForm handling and the rendering logic that triggers the deprecation warning. This analysis helps in understanding how the deprecation warning is generated and what parts of the code are involved in the management form processing and template usage.",
