The issue suggests considering a special case to avoid producing the warning for management forms. In the search results, the `django/forms/formsets.py` file contains the `ManagementForm` class definition and the `BaseFormSet` class which includes the `management_form` method. These are directly related to the management of formsets and could potentially be the source of the warning. Additionally, the `django/forms/renderers.py` file contains the `BaseRenderer` class which defines the `form_template_name` that might be relevant to the deprecation warning. Thus, the relevant code spans are those that define the `ManagementForm` and any methods or classes that interact with it, as well as the renderer templates that might be causing the deprecation warning. The `management_form` method within `BaseFormSet` is particularly intriguing as it initializes the `ManagementForm`.",
