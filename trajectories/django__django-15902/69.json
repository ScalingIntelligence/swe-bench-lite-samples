Upon reviewing the search results, the most relevant code spans are found in 'django/forms/formsets.py'. The spans include the definition of the ManagementForm class, its clean method which sets default values for TOTAL_FORM_COUNT and INITIAL_FORM_COUNT, and the BaseFormSet class which uses this ManagementForm. Additionally, the ManagementForm's usage in BaseFormSet's management_form method, which is decorated with @cached_property, is crucial. This method ensures the ManagementForm is instantiated and cleaned appropriately, suggesting the main area of concern for avoiding the deprecation warning. Further inspecting the code around these spans doesn't reveal any direct usage of 'default.html', implying the issue might be caused by the default behavior of Django's form rendering mechanisms, possibly leading to warnings if custom handling is not evident. Expanding search beyond these results might be necessary if deeper context beyond the management form handling is needed to fully understand and address the deprecation warning.",
