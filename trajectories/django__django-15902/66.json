Given that the user asserts they never use the `{{ form }}` template expression, the focus should be on the ManagementForm class and its integration within the formset management logic. After analyzing the search results, the following code spans appear relevant:\n\n1. The definition of the ManagementForm class in 'django/forms/formsets.py' (`span id='ManagementForm'`). This is directly related to the ManagementForm that produces the deprecation warning.\n\n2. The integration of the ManagementForm within the BaseFormSet class, specifically in the `management_form` method (`span id='BaseFormSet.management_form'`), which handles the creation of the management form for formsets. This method is crucial as it deals directly with how the ManagementForm is instantiated and used within formsets.\n\n3. The InlineModelAdmin class in 'django/contrib/admin/options.py', particularly the `get_formset` method (`span id='InlineModelAdmin.get_formset'`), which demonstrates how formsets are created within the admin interface. This is relevant as it shows context where ManagementForm could be used or affected within admin functionalities.\n\nGiven the user's concern about special-casing the warning for management forms, focusing on these spans will provide essential insight into the core functionality and potential places for modification to address the deprecation warning.",
