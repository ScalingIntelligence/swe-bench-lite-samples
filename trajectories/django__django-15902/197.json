There is an inquiry about whether to special-case and avoid producing the warning for management forms.\n\nReviewing the search results reveals several key areas that are highly relevant to the issue: the definition of the ManagementForm class itself; the clean method within ManagementForm, which might handle data validation and could be where the issue arises; and the BaseFormSet class, which includes methods related to management_form and error handling, crucial for understanding formset management.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are those defining and interacting with the ManagementForm and BaseFormSet, particularly the management_form method and the ManagementForm class definition.

The user is specifically concerned about the management form production which only produces hidden inputs and yet still triggers the deprecation warning. The goal is to determine if special-casing is necessary to avoid producing the warning for management forms.\n\nFrom the provided search results, we can analyze the code relevant to ManagementForm and BaseFormSet. The ManagementForm class definition in `django/forms/formsets.py` includes fields that are all hidden inputs, which is consistent with the context of the issue. The `ManagementForm.clean` method is also relevant as it sets default values for the form counts.\n\nThe `BaseFormSet` class is crucial here as it interacts with the ManagementForm. The `BaseFormSet.management_form` method is of particular interest as it initializes the ManagementForm and performs a full clean, which is directly related to the form processing that could be issuing the deprecation warning. Additionally, the `formset_factory` function is relevant as it sets up the attributes for the formset, including rendering related configurations.\n\nThe search result in `django/forms/renderers.py` is unrelated to the issue at hand, as it pertains to rendering templates without specifically addressing the management form deprecation warning. Therefore, I will focus on the relevant parts in `django/forms/formsets.py` for the identified spans.",
