The 'ManagementForm.clean' span shows the clean method of the ManagementForm class, which handles form data cleaning and is likely relevant to the formset management. The 'BaseFormSet.management_form' span defines the management_form property in the BaseFormSet class, which is responsible for creating the management form instance for the formset. This is highly relevant as it is directly involved in the formset management form production. The 'formset_factory' span shows the formset_factory function, which is used to create specific formset instances and is also relevant to the formset management process.
