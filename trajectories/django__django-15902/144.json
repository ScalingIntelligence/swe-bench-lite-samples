The specific code spans that are relevant to the reported issue include the entire ManagementForm class (span_ids: imports, ManagementForm, ManagementForm.clean) as it defines the form fields and clean method that could be producing the deprecation warning. Additionally, the BaseFormSet.management_form (span_ids: BaseFormSet, BaseFormSet.management_form) is relevant because it is the cached property that instantiates the ManagementForm.
