The management form is responsible for managing the state and validation of formsets, including the number of forms and their initial state. Key areas of interest include the ManagementForm class, the BaseFormSet class which uses ManagementForm, and the formset_factory function that initializes formsets. These sections of code are directly related to the handling and rendering of management forms and thus are highly relevant to the reported issue. To address the deprecation warning specifically for management forms, understanding and modifying these parts of the codebase will be necessary. Therefore, these sections are marked as relevant to the reported issue.",
