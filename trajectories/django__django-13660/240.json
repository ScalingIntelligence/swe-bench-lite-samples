The current implementation of `exec` in the `handle` method of the `shell.py` file is causing a `NameError` because it does not properly handle the global namespace. To resolve this, `exec` should be passed a dictionary containing a minimal set of globals to prevent namespace pollution. The search should focus on this specific file and the relevant code snippet where `exec` is called. Additionally, considering the context provided in the issue description, a specific detail to focus on is how `exec` is being used in the `handle` method. This method is crucial for running commands passed to the Django shell.",

The traceback in the issue indicates a `NameError` due to the unavailability of `django` within the context when executed with `exec`. Upon analyzing the new search results, the relevant code span is found in the `handle` method within the `Command` class in `django/core/management/commands/shell.py`. The `handle` method executes the command provided via `options['command']` directly using `exec` without defining a minimal set of globals. This explains the crash, as essential contexts like `django` might not be loaded effectively. The solution proposed is to pass a new, empty dictionary as the second argument to `exec` to ensure a minimal set of globals is defined, thus preventing undefined variable errors. Based on this analysis, the identified span is relevant to the reported issue.",
