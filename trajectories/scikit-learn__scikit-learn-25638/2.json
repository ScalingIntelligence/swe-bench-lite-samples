To address this, the solution proposed is to ensure the same behavior as when using standard dtypes ('int64', 'float64', 'bool'), which does not raise an error. The current context and search results show that the `unique_labels` function relies on `type_of_target` to determine the type of labels and `check_array` for array validation. Given this, the relevant code spans to address the issue include the handling of dtype conversions and checks within `unique_labels`, `type_of_target`, and `check_array` functions.

The `check_array` function includes logic for handling pandas dtypes, and the `type_of_target` function is critical for determining the type of the target labels.
