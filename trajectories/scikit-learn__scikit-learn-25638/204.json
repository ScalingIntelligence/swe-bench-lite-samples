Because the dtypes become `object` dtype when converted to numpy arrays we get `ValueError: Mix type of y not allowed, got types {'binary', 'unknown'}`:\r\n\r\nRepro with sklearn 1.2.1\r\n```py \r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import pytest\r\n    from sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\r\n    \r\n    for dtype in [\"Int64\", \"Float64\", \"boolean\"]:\r\n        y_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\r\n        y_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\r\n\r\n        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=\"Mix type of y not allowed, got types\"):\r\n            unique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\r\n```\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nWe should get the same behavior as when `int64`, `float64`, and `bool` dtypes are used, which is no error:  \r\n\r\n```python\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    from sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\r\n    \r\n    for dtype in [\"int64\", \"float64\", \"bool\"]:\r\n        y_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\r\n        y_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\r\n\r\n        unique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nOur current workaround is to convert the data to numpy arrays with the corresponding dtype that works prior to passing it into `unique_labels`.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n"
