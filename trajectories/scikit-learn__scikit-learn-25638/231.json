From the search results, it's evident that the `unique_labels` function in `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py` is central to this issue. This function raises a `ValueError` when it encounters mixed types, which is precisely what happens when nullable pandas dtypes are passed and subsequently converted to `object` dtype in numpy arrays. Additionally, the `check_array` function in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is relevant as it manages the validation and conversion of input arrays, including handling of pandas DataFrame and Series types, which are integral to the issue at hand. By focusing on these two functions, we can pinpoint the areas where modifications or enhancements are needed to ensure that nullable pandas dtypes are supported without raising type mixing errors. Specifically, the `unique_labels` function needs to be adapted to recognize and appropriately handle these nullable types, possibly by normalizing them to a consistent type before further processing. The `check_array` function may also require adjustments to properly convert these types and handle any peculiarities related to their processing.",
