This function is responsible for determining the unique labels in the target variable y, which is critical for classification tasks. The issue arises because when nullable pandas dtypes ('Int64', 'Float64', 'boolean') are used, they are converted to numpy arrays with 'object' dtype, leading to a 'ValueError: Mix type of y not allowed, got types' error. The solution proposed is to ensure that these dtypes are handled similarly to their non-nullable counterparts ('int64', 'float64', 'bool'), which do not result in this error. The provided search results show the `unique_labels` function definition and an associated function `_check_partial_fit_first_call` that also uses `unique_labels`. The code spans identified are relevant as they directly involve the functionality of handling different y types and ensuring unique labels are correctly identified. After reviewing the code, it appears that the error arises from the type checking logic within `unique_labels`, specifically where it checks for mixed types. Addressing this will involve modifying the type checking logic to accommodate nullable pandas dtypes without raising an error.",

Because the dtypes become `object` dtype when converted to numpy arrays we get `ValueError: Mix type of y not allowed, got types {'binary', 'unknown'}`:\r\n\r\nRepro with sklearn 1.2.1\r\n```py \r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import pytest\r\n    from sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\r\n    \r\n    for dtype in [\"Int64\", \"Float64\", \"boolean\"]:\r\n        y_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\r\n        y_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\r\n\r\n        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=\"Mix type of y not allowed, got types\"):\r\n            unique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\r\n```\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nWe should get the same behavior as when `int64`, `float64`, and `bool` dtypes are used, which is no error:  \r\n\r\n```python\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    from sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\r\n    \r\n    for dtype in [\"int64\", \"float64\", \"bool\"]:\r\n        y_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\r\n        y_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\r\n\r\n        unique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nOur current workaround is to convert the data to numpy arrays with the corresponding dtype that works prior to passing it into `unique_labels`.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n"
