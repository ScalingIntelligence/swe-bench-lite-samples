The main problem identified is that when these dtypes are converted to numpy arrays, they become `object` dtype, leading to a `ValueError` due to mixed types. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle or influence the behavior of `unique_labels` with different dtypes. \n\nIn the search results, the most relevant code spans are within the `unique_labels` function in `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py` and the `check_array` function in `sklearn/utils/validation.py`. The `unique_labels` function is directly responsible for handling and validating the input types. The `check_array` function is used within `unique_labels` to ensure the input arrays are in the correct format. These are critical sections for implementing the proposed solution to support the nullable dtypes.\n\nThe `type_of_target` function also plays a key role in determining the type of the input data, which is then used to validate and process the data within `unique_labels`. Therefore, these spans are relevant to the reported issue.\n\nConsidering the detailed analysis of the search results and the reported issue, the identified spans are crucial for addressing the problem of supporting nullable pandas dtypes in the `unique_labels` function.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about supporting nullable pandas dtypes ('Int64', 'Float64', 'boolean') in sklearn's `unique_labels` function. The issue arises because these dtypes become 'object' dtype when converted to numpy arrays, leading to a 'ValueError: Mix type of y not allowed, got types {'binary', 'unknown'}'. The proposed solution is to ensure the same behavior as when using 'int64', 'float64', and 'bool' dtypes, which should not raise an error. The current workaround is to convert the data to numpy arrays with the corresponding dtype that works prior to passing it into `unique_labels`. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that the `unique_labels` function and `type_of_target` function in `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py` are directly related to the issue. The `type_of_target` function determines the type of the target data, and the `unique_labels` function uses this information to handle the labels. The `check_array` function in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` also appears relevant as it handles array validation and may play a role in converting the pandas dtypes to a form acceptable by `unique_labels`. Given the context and the search results, the identified code spans are sufficient to address the issue.",

These functions are central to handling data types and ensuring input validity, which are directly related to the issue of supporting nullable pandas dtypes. The `unique_labels` function uses `type_of_target` to categorize the type of target data, and if the types are mixed, it raises an error. The `check_array` function is involved in preprocessing and validation of the input arrays, which could influence how nullable dtypes are handled. Given the complexity of dtypes when interacting with pandas and numpy, it's likely that further investigation into these core functions and their handling of dtypes is required to identify the necessary adjustments to support nullable dtypes. Therefore, a renewed focus on these functions and how they process data types is imperative.",

  "initial_message": "Support nullable pandas dtypes in `unique_labels`\n### Describe the workflow you want to enable\n\nI would like to be able to pass the nullable pandas dtypes (\"Int64\", \"Float64\", \"boolean\") into sklearn's `unique_labels` function. Because the dtypes become `object` dtype when converted to numpy arrays we get `ValueError: Mix type of y not allowed, got types {'binary', 'unknown'}`:\r\n\r\nRepro with sklearn 1.2.1\r\n```py \r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import pytest\r\n    from sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\r\n    \r\n    for dtype in [\"Int64\", \"Float64\", \"boolean\"]:\r\n        y_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\r\n        y_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\r\n\r\n        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=\"Mix type of y not allowed, got types\"):\r\n            unique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\r\n```\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nWe should get the same behavior as when `int64`, `float64`, and `bool` dtypes are used, which is no error:  \r\n\r\n```python\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    from sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\r\n    \r\n    for dtype in [\"int64\", \"float64\", \"bool\"]:\r\n        y_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\r\n        y_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\r\n\r\n        unique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nOur current workaround is to convert the data to numpy arrays with the corresponding dtype that works prior to passing it into `unique_labels`.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n"
