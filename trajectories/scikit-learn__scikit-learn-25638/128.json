The code spans provided include functions `unique_labels`, `check_array`, and `check_X_y`.

The `check_array` function also plays a role as it manages type conversions and checks before processing arrays.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue relates to supporting nullable pandas dtypes in the `unique_labels` function of sklearn. The current implementation of `unique_labels` relies on the `type_of_target` function to determine the type of the input data, which may not correctly handle nullable dtypes, leading to a ValueError when mixed types are detected. The issue specifically mentions that when nullable pandas dtypes are converted to numpy arrays, they become `object` dtype, which causes the function to fail. The proposed solution is to handle these dtypes similarly to standard int64, float64, and bool dtypes without raising an error. The search results show the relevant code spans for `unique_labels` and `check_array`, which are key functions in managing the input data types. The `unique_labels` function is responsible for identifying unique labels and managing the types of the input data. The `check_array` function is used to validate and possibly convert the input data to an appropriate format. Given these insights, the relevant code spans are those from the `unique_labels` and `check_array` functions, as they directly address the type handling and conversion issues raised in the reported issue.",

Because the dtypes become `object` dtype when converted to numpy arrays we get `ValueError: Mix type of y not allowed, got types {'binary', 'unknown'}`:\r\n\r\nRepro with sklearn 1.2.1\r\n```py \r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import pytest\r\n    from sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\r\n    \r\n    for dtype in [\"Int64\", \"Float64\", \"boolean\"]:\r\n        y_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\r\n        y_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\r\n\r\n        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=\"Mix type of y not allowed, got types\"):\r\n            unique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\r\n```\n\n### Describe your proposed solution\n\nWe should get the same behavior as when `int64`, `float64`, and `bool` dtypes are used, which is no error:  \r\n\r\n```python\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    from sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels\r\n    \r\n    for dtype in [\"int64\", \"float64\", \"bool\"]:\r\n        y_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)\r\n        y_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=\"int64\")\r\n\r\n        unique_labels(y_true, y_predicted)\r\n```\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n\nOur current workaround is to convert the data to numpy arrays with the corresponding dtype that works prior to passing it into `unique_labels`.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n"
