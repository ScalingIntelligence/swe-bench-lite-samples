The primary concern is ensuring that the ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter updates correctly with the renamed primary key field. Relevant operations might be found in the migration operations related to field alterations (like RenameField) and also in how ForeignKey fields are managed during such changes. The provided context points to various migration operations and related field handling methods within the Django codebase that could influence how ForeignKeys are updated during a field rename. Focusing on these areas should help identify where the logic fails to update the `to_field` parameter correctly.",

This issue is related to the Django migration operations handling field renaming and foreign key references. The provided search results contain relevant code spans from Django's migration operations modules, particularly focusing on field operations and model operations. These code spans include implementations for renaming fields, altering fields, and managing foreign key references. The 'RenameField' and 'AlterField' operations are particularly relevant as they handle field renaming and field alteration, which is the core of the reported issue. The 'field_references_model' and 'field_references_field' methods are also important as they manage how fields reference other models and fields, potentially including foreign key references. The 'AlterField' operation's handling of foreign key references during the state transition demonstrates the logic that might fail to update the 'to_field' parameter correctly. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",
