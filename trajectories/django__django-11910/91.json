The provided search results include relevant code spans from Django's migration operations and utilities that handle field renaming and alterations. Specifically, the `RenameField` operation in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and the `AlterField` operation are crucial, as they deal with the logic of renaming fields and altering them, respectively. Additionally, the `is_referenced_by_foreign_key` function in `django/db/migrations/operations/utils.py` is important for identifying if a field is referenced by a ForeignKey, which directly relates to the issue.

This allows for a comprehensive understanding of the code's behavior during field renaming, including how the system updates references in a way that should resolve the issue described.
