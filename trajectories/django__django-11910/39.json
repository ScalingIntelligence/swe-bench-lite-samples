Specifically, after renaming the PrimaryKey from `field_wrong` to `field_fixed`, the `to_field` parameter in the ForeignKey still references the old field name (`field_wrong`). This can be traced to how Django handles field renaming and updates ForeignKey references. To resolve this, we need to focus on the `RenameField` and `AlterField` operations in Django's migration framework, as well as how ForeignKey references are managed and updated during migrations.",

This behavior is critical for maintaining the integrity of relationships between models during migrations.\n\nAfter analyzing the search results, it's evident that the core of the issue lies in how Django handles field renaming and updates related fields. The relevant code spans are from the `AlterField` and `RenameField` classes in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. These sections define how fields are altered and renamed during migrations and how ForeignKey fields are defined and managed. Specifically, the `RenameField.state_forwards` method, which is responsible for updating the state of the model after a field rename, should ensure that related ForeignKey fields have their `to_field` attribute updated to reference the new field name.\n\nThe provided search results do not directly include the exact bug fix, but it does cover the necessary operations and field definitions that need to be adjusted to remedy the issue. Relevant spans include `AlterField.reduce`, `RenameField.state_forwards`, and `ForeignKey.deconstruct`.",
