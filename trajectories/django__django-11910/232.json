The problem seems to be in the way the migration operations handle the renaming and updating of ForeignKey references. To address this, we should focus on the `RenameField` and `AlterField` operations in the `django.db.migrations.operations.fields` module, as well as how ForeignKey references are managed in `django.db.models.fields.related`. Additionally, we need to examine the `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django.db.migrations.autodetector` to understand how it detects and handles field renames relative to ForeignKey fields. Given the provided context, we can formulate one search request to concentrate on the `RenameField` operation within the `fields.py` file.",

The search results include relevant code from the `RenameField` class within Django's migration operations. Specifically, the `RenameField.state_forwards` method is responsible for updating the state of the model during a migration, including renaming fields in various related structures. This method iterates through the fields of the model and updates any references to the old field name with the new one. It also handles updating related fields in other models that reference the renamed field. This is crucial because it directly addresses the problem described in the issue where foreign keys should correctly reference the new name of the PrimaryKey field after it has been renamed. Therefore, the identified code spans from `RenameField.state_forwards` and the surrounding methods like `RenameField.__init__`, `RenameField.deconstruct`, and `RenameField.references_field` are likely relevant to resolving the issue. These sections demonstrate the logic used to handle the renaming process and ensure that all references are updated accordingly.",
