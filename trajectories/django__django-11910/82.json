The relevant operations involve the handling of ForeignKey relationships during migration, specifically how RenameField and AlterField operations impact ForeignKey references. The existing context suggests that the operations related to field renaming and foreign key management are spread across multiple modules within Django's migration framework. To pinpoint the exact location of the bug or the logic that needs to be adjusted, a focused search on the `RenameField` and `AlterField` operations in the context of ForeignKey management is necessary. Additionally, investigating how these operations impact the state and database forwards/backwards methods in the migration operations, especially in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` files, should yield relevant code spans. The search should also consider any utility functions or methods that handle foreign key reference updates during migrations, possibly in `django/db/migrations/operations/utils.py` or `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`.",

AlterField's 'database_forwards' method, which alters fields in the database.\n3. FieldOperation's 'references_field' method, which determines if an operation references a specific field. \n\nThese sections collectively cover the states and database operations during field alterations, closely aligned with the reported issue.
