The ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter still points to the old field name even after the primary key field has been renamed. This problem might be rooted in how Django's migration operations handle field renaming and updates to related fields.

Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` should be examined to understand how it constructs or updates foreign key references.",

The search results point to two key areas: 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'. In 'fields.py', the RenameField class is crucial as it handles field renaming operations. The state_forwards method specifically updates the state of the field renaming, but it needs to ensure that all references, especially ForeignKey references, are correctly updated to point to the new field name. This involves detailed inspection of the references_field method to ensure it updates ForeignKey references correctly. In 'related.py', the ForeignKey class definition is the starting point for understanding how ForeignKey fields are defined and how their attributes (like to_field) are managed. The __init__ method for ForeignKey sets up the field, including the to_field attribute, which should ideally be updated during migration if the referenced field is renamed. This analysis suggests that the identified code spans are directly related to the issue at hand, particularly how field references are updated during migration and how ForeignKey fields manage their to_field attribute. The spans involving RenameField and ForeignKey's __init__ method are especially relevant.",

The `state_forwards` method in `RenameField` should be able to handle this update across models. I'll focus on updating the `state_forwards` method to ensure that any references to the old field name in `ForeignKey` fields are correctly updated to the new field name after a field rename operation. This involves iterating through all models and their fields to find any `ForeignKey` fields that reference the renamed field and updating their `to_field` attribute.",
