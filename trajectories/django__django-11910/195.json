The issue is evident in the migration operations where the RenameField operation is applied, but the corresponding ForeignKey does not update. The search results provide insights into how Django handles field renaming and foreign key relationships. In `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`, the RenameField class is detailed, showing how Django updates field names in the state. However, the `model_state.fields` list update only covers local field changes and does not account for foreign key references to these fields. The ForeignKey class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` shows how foreign key constraints are created but does not address automatic updates upon field renaming. The `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` provides schema editing operations, notably `_alter_field`, which handles changes to fields, including foreign keys, but again, this does not automatically handle updates triggered by other field changes like RenameField. Lastly, `django/db/migrations/operations/utils.py` offers utility functions like `is_referenced_by_foreign_key`, which checks if a model is referenced by another model via a foreign key, but this also does not solve the issue of auto-updating `to_field`. Given these insights, the reported issue persists because Django's migration operations do not automatically update foreign key references when a primary key is renamed. Developers must manually adjust these references in subsequent migration operations. Relevant code spans include RenameField's `state_forwards` and `database_forwards` for understanding how field renaming works, and ForeignKey's `deconstruct` method for understanding how foreign keys are defined.",

This can be addressed by ensuring that the RenameField operation also updates any references to the old field name in ForeignKey fields. The current implementation of RenameField.state_forwards partially handles this but doesn't update the 'to_field' attribute of ForeignKey fields. Therefore, the focus should be on modifying the RenameField.state_forwards method to ensure that not only 'from_fields' but also 'to_fields' are updated when a field is renamed.",
