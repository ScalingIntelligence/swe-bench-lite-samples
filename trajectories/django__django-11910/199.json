Specifically, the 'RenameField' and 'AlterField' operations in the 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' file handle the renaming of fields and altering of field attributes, respectively. These operations are critical for understanding how field references are updated during migrations. Additionally, the 'MigrationAutodetector' class in 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' is relevant as it detects changes between models and generates the necessary migration operations. This class includes methods related to handling foreign key dependencies and model field changes, which are directly related to the issue at hand. The 'is_referenced_by_foreign_key' function in 'django/db/migrations/operations/utils.py' checks if a field is referenced by foreign keys, providing context on how foreign key references are identified in the migration process. Overall, these code spans offer a comprehensive view of how field renaming and foreign key handling occur in Django migrations, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.",

To address this, we should focus on the migration operations related to field renaming and foreign key alterations.
