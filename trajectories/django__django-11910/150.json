This causes the `to_field` to still reference the old field's name rather than the new one. To address this, we need to investigate how Django's migration operations manage field references and updates, particularly focusing on the RenameField and AlterField operations. Additionally, we should look into how ForeignKey fields are handled during these operations to ensure they correctly update their references.",

This indicates a potential problem during the migration process where the ForeignKey's 'to_field' parameter isn't updated to reflect the new field name. I will analyze the provided code snippets from django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py and django/db/models/fields/related.py to identify the relevant code spans. From the search results, the crucial parts seem to be the RenameField and AlterField classes. RenameField handles the renaming of a field, and AlterField is responsible for modifying a field. In the provided code, I can see methods like 'database_forwards', 'database_backwards', 'deconstruct', and 'state_forwards' that are critical for handling migrations. 'RenameField.database_forwards' directly addresses the issue in question, as it is responsible for applying migration changes including the renaming of fields in the database. Additionally, 'AlterField' is significant because it allows the database to be updated to reflect the current field characteristics after a field modification. From the Django models perspective, understanding how ForeignKey fields are handled, specifically in the ForeignKey.__init__ method is essential to grasp how and when 'to_field' is set or updated. As per the issue description, it seems like an oversight during the migration might lead to this situation. The relevant code spans are likely those that deal with the ForeignKey's 'to_field' parameter update on migrations. Considering the provided code, the relevant spans for RenameField would be its methods like 'database_forwards' and 'state_forwards', as they directly influence the field renaming process. Moreover, the ForeignKey's '__init__' method is pertinent since it sets the 'to_field' parameter, which associations need to be reviewed and potentially updated during the migration process.",

However, the search results contain additional details that could be highly relevant, particularly the `RenameField` and `AlterField` operations which handle field renaming and alteration, respectively. It's clear from the context and search results that while a field is renamed ('field_wrong' to 'field_fixed'), the `ForeignKey`'s `to_field` parameter retains the old field name ('field_wrong'), which is not automatically updated. This consistent behavior indicates a gap in the Django migration logic that doesn't propagate changes toForeignKey references when their target field is renamed.
