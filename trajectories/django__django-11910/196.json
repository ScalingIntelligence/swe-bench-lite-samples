The issue describes two models, `ModelA` and `ModelB`, where `ModelA` has a `PrimaryKey` field that gets renamed. However, `ModelB`'s `ForeignKey` still references the old field name after the rename operation. To address this issue, it's crucial to understand how Django's migration operations handle field renaming and the updates to related fields. The search results provide several key sections of code related to field operations in Django migrations, including `RenameField`, `AlterField`, and other related methods. These sections are critical for understanding how Django updates field names and handles references to those fields during migration operations. Specifically, the `RenameField.state_forwards` and `RenameField.database_forwards` methods are particularly relevant as they deal with updating the state and the database schema respectively when a field is renamed. Additionally, the `AlterField` class and its methods are important to understand how fields are altered during migrations. Lastly, the `FieldOperation.references_field` method is relevant to understand how Django identifies field references within operations, which is crucial for ensuring all references are updated correctly after a field rename.",
