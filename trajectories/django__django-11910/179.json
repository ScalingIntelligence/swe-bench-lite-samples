The models in question are ModelA and ModelB, where ModelA has a renamed primary key from 'field_wrong' to 'field_fixed'. ModelB has a ForeignKey relationship to ModelA, and the to_field parameter is incorrectly referencing the old field name 'field_wrong' instead of the new 'field_fixed'. The relevant code spans seem to be in the migration operations dealing with renaming fields and altering foreign keys.",

This issue is related to how migrations handle field renaming and the impact on ForeignKey references. The search results provide detailed insights into the operations involved in handling fields during migrations, particularly focusing on the 'RenameField', 'AlterField', and their respective methods. These methods include 'state_forwards', 'database_forwards', and 'database_backwards' which are critical for understanding how Django manages state and database changes during migrations. The code spans cover the necessary operations and checks to ensure fields are correctly renamed and referenced, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand. By analyzing these code spans, we can understand how Django updates model states and database schemas during such operations, and identify potential areas of improvement or corrective actions for the reported issue.",
