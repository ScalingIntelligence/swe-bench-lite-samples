The problem is that the ForeignKey still points to the old field name ('field_wrong') even after the PrimaryKey field has been renamed to 'field_fixed'. This suggests that there might be a discrepancy or a bug in how the migration operations handle field references. To address this, we should focus our search on the migration operations related to field renaming and ForeignKeys in Django's migration framework. Specifically, we should look into the `RenameField` and `AlterField` operations, as well as how ForeignKeys are managed and updated during these operations.",

The provided search results contain code from Django's migration operations module, specifically focused on field operations like `AlterField` and `RenameField`. These operations handle the state and database changes when fields are altered or renamed in Django models. The relevant code spans include the `AlterField` and `RenameField` classes, and their methods such as `state_forwards`, `database_forwards`, and `references_field`. These methods deal with updating the state of models, applying database changes, and managing references to fields. By examining these spans, we can understand how Django handles field renaming and identify the section that could potentially address the issue with `ForeignKey` references not updating correctly after a rename. This analysis will help in fixing the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The provided file context includes the relevant code for handling field operations in Django migrations, specifically the `RenameField` and `AlterField` operations. These operations are crucial for understanding how field renaming and alterations are processed, which directly relates to the issue of the `to_field` parameter in a ForeignKey not updating correctly after a PrimaryKey field renaming. The file context includes detailed methods for state changes and database forwards/backwards operations. It handles references to fields and models, ensuring that changes propagate correctly across the system. However, while the context provides a comprehensive view of how these operations work in Django's migration framework, it does not explicitly address the issue of ForeignKey's `to_field` not updating upon a PrimaryKey field's rename. This implies that the provided context might be missing a specific handling or update mechanism within these operations specifically for ForeignKey's `to_field`. To find a complete solution, one would need to inspect further if there's specialized handling for such cases or if this is indeed an overlooked scenario in the framework.",

These operations primarily handle the state and database changes when fields are added, removed, altered, or renamed. The issue described, where a ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter does not update after a PrimaryKey field renaming, suggests a possible discrepancy in how references are updated or maintained during field renaming operations. Given the provided code, it's notable that `RenameField` updates the state of the model's fields and related references, but it does not explicitly address how ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter is updated or checked for consistency post-rename.

The issue is that the to_field points to the old field name after the renaming, not the new one. The file context provided includes operations related to field manipulation in Django migrations such as AddField, RemoveField, AlterField, and RenameField. These operations are crucial for understanding how field renaming is handled in Django and how foreign keys might be affected. The search results include the same file context, emphasizing field operations and their methods like references_model, references_field, state_forwards, database_forwards, etc. These methods are analyzed to understand how they manage field references and updates, which is key to solving the reported issue. The analysis of these methods reveals that while RenameField updates the state and database schema for a field, there might be a need to also update any ForeignKey fields referencing the renamed field to ensure they point to the new field name. This suggests that the relevant code spans for addressing the issue would be those related to the RenameField operation and how ForeignKey fields are handled during and after this operation. These spans include the RenameField and AlterField classes and their methods for handling the forward and backward states and database schema operations.",

However, the relevant code snippet shows that while `RenameField` updates field names in the model's state, it does not explicitly cover the updating or checking of `to_field` parameters in ForeignKey fields after a field has been renamed. This omission might be why ForeignKey fields still reference the old field name after a rename operation. The code does check for remote fields and updates their references if they exist, but it lacks specific handling for ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter directly. This oversight could result in ForeignKey fields not being correctly updated to point to the new field name after a field rename operation, leading to the issue described.

These files include operations like 'RenameField', 'AlterField', and 'RenameModel' which are directly related to altering fields and models, including the handling of primary keys and foreign keys. The 'RenameField' operation is particularly relevant as it directly deals with renaming fields, which includes updating references to these fields. Additionally, the 'AlterField' operation handles the alteration of fields, which is likely where the to_field parameter update should occur after a rename operation. Both files include methods for updating the state of models and databases during these operations, thereby potentially addressing the issue of the to_field referencing the old field name after a rename.

These classes handle various aspects of field operations, including adding, removing, altering, and renaming fields. The `RenameField` class specifically deals with renaming fields and updates the state of the model accordingly. However, the relevant code snippet shows that while `RenameField` updates field names in the model's state, it does not explicitly cover the updating or checking of `to_field` parameters in ForeignKey fields after a field has been renamed. This omission might be why ForeignKey fields still reference the old field name after a rename operation. The code does check for remote fields and updates their references if they exist, but it lacks specific handling for ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter directly. This oversight could result in ForeignKey fields not being correctly updated to point to the new field name after a field rename operation, leading to the issue described. Further investigation should focus on enhancing or adding operations or checks that specifically address updating ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter when related fields are renamed.",
