This requires examining the code related to field renaming and ForeignKey field alteration in Django's migration operations. The search results provided include significant portions of code from django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py, which are pertinent to the issue. Specifically, the code spans related to RenameField and AlterField operations, as well as the references_field method, are highly relevant. These code spans handle the renaming of fields and the alteration of fields, including the to_field parameter in ForeignKey operations, which directly addresses the issue at hand. Additionally, the AlterModelTable and AlterTogetherOptionOperation classes are also relevant as they handle changes to model options that might indirectly impact ForeignKey fields. Thus, these code spans together provide a comprehensive view of how field renaming and ForeignKey changes are managed in Django migrations.",
