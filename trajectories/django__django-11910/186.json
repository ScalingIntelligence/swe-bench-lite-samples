This suggests that the system might not be updating ForeignKey references correctly when a PrimaryKey is renamed. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the Django migration operations related to altering and renaming fields, particularly those operations impacting ForeignKey fields. Specifically, it would be beneficial to check the implementation of RenameField and AlterField operations, as well as how ForeignKey fields are handled during these operations.",

The relevant code spans include methods for updating the state of models, altering database fields, and renaming fields, which are crucial for understanding how migrations handle field changes and potential issues related to field references.

This omission is likely why the 'to_field' parameter does not get updated with the new name after a PrimaryKey renaming. In the state_forwards method of RenameField, the update of ForeignKey references is handled by iterating through all models and their fields, adjusting the references to the renamed field. However, this adjustment does not involve explicitly checking or updating the 'to_field' parameter within the ForeignKey definitions. Furthermore, the AlterField operation is focused on altering the field definition rather than updating ForeignKey references, making it unsuitable for addressing this issue. The missing piece here is a specific handling of the 'to_field' parameter within the logic that updates ForeignKey references during a PrimaryKey rename. This suggests that a potential solution might involve enhancing the RenameField operation to specifically check and update the 'to_field' parameter in any ForeignKey fields pointing to the renamed PrimaryKey.",

The issue revolves around the handling of ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter when renaming a PrimaryKey in model fields. The provided search results include several relevant sections, particularly the `AlterField`, `RenameField`, and `ModelOperation` classes, which handle field alterations and model operations during migrations. Based on the issue description, the focus is on how the `to_field` parameter in ForeignKey fields is not updated correctly to reflect changes after a PrimaryKey field has been renamed. This suggests that the logic in `RenameField.state_forwards` and `AlterField.state_forwards` might be crucial for ensuring that the ForeignKey references are updated correctly. Thus, I have selected relevant spans from these classes that handle state updates, particularly those that deal with renaming fields and altering field states to ensure the changes propagate correctly to related fields. This includes spans dealing with field references and updating model state to reflect new field names accurately.",

However, the analysis concludes that while RenameField updates ForeignKey references, it does not explicitly handle the 'to_field' parameter within ForeignKey fields, which is the core issue described. AlterField operation is focused on altering the field definition and does not address ForeignKey references, making it unsuitable for the reported issue.
