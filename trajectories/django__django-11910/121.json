Specifically, after renaming the field from `field_wrong` to `field_fixed`, the `to_field` parameter in the `ForeignKey` still points to the old field name. This issue suggests that Django's migration operations might not correctly update references to the renamed field.\n\nIn the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file. The `RenameField` class and its methods (`__init__`, `database_forwards`, `database_backwards`) are particularly relevant as they handle the renaming of fields. Additionally, the `AlterField` class and its methods (`__init__`, `database_forwards`, `database_backwards`) are also relevant as they alter existing fields, which might be involved in updating the `ForeignKey`'s `to_field` parameter.\n\nThese code spans are crucial for understanding how Django handles field renaming and field alteration during migrations. They show the operations performed when renaming a field and altering a field, which could potentially be the source of the issue reported. Understanding these operations will help in identifying if there's a bug in how Django updates references to renamed fields.",

The issue described involves ensuring that ForeignKey fields correctly reference the new field name after a PrimaryKey field has been renamed. The code in the file context shows how these operations work but does not explicitly address the automatic updating of ForeignKey's to_field parameter.

This issue is directly related to the handling of field renaming and foreign key relationships in the Django migration operations. The search results include definitions of the RenameField and AlterField operations, which are critical for understanding how field renaming and field alteration are managed in Django migrations. These operations define methods for handling database forwards and backwards operations, as well as state updates, which are essential for understanding how field renaming propagates through the model state and affects foreign key relationships. The RenameField operation specifically addresses field renaming and updates references to the field. The AlterField operation handles changes to field attributes. The issue suggests that the 'to_field' parameter in the ForeignKey is not updated correctly during the migration process, which could be due to the state not being updated to reflect the new field name in time for the AlterField operation on the ForeignKey. By analyzing these operations, we can identify if the current implementation correctly handles the renaming of primary keys and updates dependent foreign keys accordingly. The search results also include utility functions like 'is_referenced_by_foreign_key' which help in checking if a field is referenced by a foreign key, providing more context on how foreign key relationships are managed in Django's migrations framework.",
