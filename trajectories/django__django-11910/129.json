The relevant code spans in the search results include the 'RenameField.state_forwards', 'ForeignKey.deconstruct', and 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._alter_field' methods.

The 'RenameField.state_forwards' method is particularly relevant as it updates field references including to_fields, which should be updated to reflect the new field name. The 'ForeignKey.deconstruct' method involves the process of deconstructing the ForeignKey field to identify its parameters, which could help in understanding how the to_field parameter is being handled. The 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._alter_field' method is relevant as it deals with the alteration of fields in the database schema, including handling foreign key constraints.
