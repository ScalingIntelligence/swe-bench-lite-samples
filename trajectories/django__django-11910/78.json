The issue describes that after renaming the field from `field_wrong` to `field_fixed`, the ForeignKey still references the old field name `field_wrong`. This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the migration code.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are primarily in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py` files. Specifically, the `RenameField` class in the migrations file is crucial as it handles the renaming of fields. The `RenameField.__init__`, `RenameField.database_forwards`, and `RenameField.database_backwards` methods are particularly relevant because they handle the actual renaming process and how it interacts with the database schema. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` class in the `related.py` file is important as it defines how foreign keys are handled, including the `to_field` parameter.\n\nThe identified code spans provide the necessary context to understand how field renaming and foreign key referencing are handled in Django. While these spans do not directly address the issue of updating the `to_field` parameter after a rename, they provide the foundational knowledge required to diagnose and potentially fix the issue. Further analysis of any additional sections not included in the search results might be necessary to determine if there are other factors influencing the persistence of the old field name in the ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter.",
