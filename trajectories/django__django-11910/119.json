This suggests a potential bug in how Django migrations handle the updating of foreign key references after a field rename. The relevant files and classes to investigate are those related to migration operations, particularly RenameField and AlterField, since these operations handle field renaming and altering. Additionally, the code handling ForeignKey definitions and updates in related models should be checked. Focus should be on the database_forwards and database_backwards methods in migration operations and the deconstruct method in related fields.",

The issue involves the 'to_field' parameter of the ForeignKey not updating to reflect the new field name after a RenameField operation. The provided search results contain relevant parts of the Django migration operations, particularly the RenameField and AlterField operations. These operations are crucial for understanding how field renaming is handled and how ForeignKey fields are altered. By examining these operations, we can identify the steps taken during a field rename and the subsequent alteration of ForeignKey fields in the database. The RenameField operation is responsible for updating the field names in the model state, while the AlterField operation handles the changes in the database schema. These operations are closely related to the issue reported, as they involve the handling of field names and their effects on ForeignKey fields. Therefore, the identified spans from these operations are relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

Given the issue description, these methods should be capable of identifying references to renamed fields, including primary keys that are referenced via ForeignKeys. Therefore, this file context appears to contain the relevant code needed to address and understand the issue of the `to_field` parameter persisting with the old field's name after a rename.
