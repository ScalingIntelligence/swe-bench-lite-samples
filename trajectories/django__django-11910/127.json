            "scratch_pad": "After analyzing the reported issue, the primary focus is on the behavior of the 'ForeignKey' field's 'to_field' parameter when renaming a PrimaryKey field. The issue specifically points out that the 'to_field' still points to the old field name ('field_wrong') after renaming the PrimaryKey ('field_wrong' to 'field_fixed').\n\nFrom the provided file context, significant code spans relevant to this issue are found in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/related.py'.\n\nIn 'fields.py', the relevant spans include 'FieldOperation', 'AlterField', and 'RenameField'. These deal specifically with operations related to altering and renaming fields, which are critical to addressing the issue as they define how Django handles field alterations in migrations.\n\nIn 'related.py', the 'ForeignKey' class is of primary interest, as it directly concerns the 'ForeignKey' field and its 'to_field' parameter. This class is responsible for defining how 'ForeignKey' fields relate to other models and fields, which is central to understanding and solving the issue at hand.\n\nThe search results do not provide further direct relevance to the reported issue. The migrations files found in the search results are associated with various Django apps like 'admin', 'auth', 'contenttypes', 'flatpages', 'redirects', 'sessions', and 'sites', and they deal with setting up initial models or altering field properties. These are typical for any Django project but do not directly address the specific issue of the 'to_field' parameter persisting with the old field name after a PrimaryKey rename.\n\nGiven the analysis, the search task appears complete as no additional search results are needed to address the primary issue.
