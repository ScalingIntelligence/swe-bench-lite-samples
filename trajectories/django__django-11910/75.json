The `AlterField` class also plays a role, as it could be misused or used incorrectly when updating ForeignKey fields. Additionally, the `FieldOperation.references_field` method helps in identifying and updating field references, which is critical for this scenario.\n\nThese sections should be sufficient for understanding and potentially fixing the issue reported, as they cover the core functionality related to field renaming and alteration in Django migrations.",

This issue is related to Django's migration operations, specifically the `RenameField` operation. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans within the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, which is responsible for defining migration operations on fields. Additionally, there are references to operations in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, which are also relevant for understanding how migrations work in Django.\n\nThe identified relevant spans include:\n- `RenameField.__init__`: This defines the initialization of the RenameField operation, which is central to the reported issue.\n- `RenameField.state_forwards`: This method updates the state of the model during the migration process, including renaming fields and potentially related fields.\n- `RenameField.database_forwards` and `RenameField.database_backwards`: These methods handle the actual database schema changes when renaming a field, which is crucial for understanding how the `to_field` parameter should be updated.\n- `FieldOperation.references_model` and `FieldOperation.references_field`: These methods help determine if a field or model is referenced by other parts of the code, which is relevant for ensuring that all related parts of the code are updated when a field is renamed.\n\nBased on the provided search results and the context of the reported issue, these code spans are highly relevant and provide a foundation for understanding and potentially addressing the issue with ForeignKey's `to_field` parameter not updating correctly after a PrimaryKey field rename.

Specifically, the issue arises when the ForeignKey still points to the old field name after the PrimaryKey has been renamed. This is evident in the provided code where the `RenameField` operation is used to rename the field from `field_wrong` to `field_fixed`. However, the subsequent `AlterField` operation for the ForeignKey in `ModelB` still references the old field name `field_wrong`. This discrepancy needs to be addressed to ensure the ForeignKey correctly points to the new field name. The search results provide relevant code spans in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file, particularly the `RenameField` class which manages field renaming, and its `state_forwards` and `database_forwards` methods that handle the state and database changes respectively. These methods need to ensure that any ForeignKey references are updated to point to the new field name. Additionally, the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file contains the `RenameModel` class which may also be involved in handling ForeignKey updates during model renaming.",
