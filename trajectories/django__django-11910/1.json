The problem is likely related to how the 'RenameField' operation handles the renaming of fields and updates related ForeignKey fields. The relevant files identified so far are part of the Django migration framework, particularly the files handling field and model operations. A detailed investigation into the implementation of the 'RenameField' operation and its interaction with ForeignKey fields is necessary to resolve this issue.",
