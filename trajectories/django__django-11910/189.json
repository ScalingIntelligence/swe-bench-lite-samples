Specifically, the `to_field` parameter continues to reference the old field name ('field_wrong') after it has been renamed to 'field_fixed'. The search results provide insights into how Django handles field operations such as renaming and altering fields. The relevant sections include the `RenameField` and `AlterField` classes, which are key to understanding how field renaming and alteration are managed in Django migrations. The `RenameField.state_forwards` method is particularly relevant as it shows how the state of the model is updated when a field is renamed, including updates to related fields. This is crucial for understanding the root cause of the issue where the `to_field` parameter does not update to reflect the new field name.\n\nTo address the issue, it's necessary to ensure that all references to the renamed field in related models are updated correctly. This involves checking the `RenameField` class to see how it updates the state of the model and related fields. The `RenameField.state_forwards` method should be inspected to confirm that it correctly updates all foreign key references. If it does not, this could be the source of the problem where the `to_field` parameter remains pointing to the old field name.\n\nThe provided code spans from the `RenameField` and `AlterField` classes are relevant to identifying the root cause and potential solutions to the reported issue. These spans include the methods for initializing, describing, reducing, and updating the state of fields during the renaming process. They also include methods for handling the database forwards and backwards operations, which are essential for understanding how the database schema is updated during migrations.",
