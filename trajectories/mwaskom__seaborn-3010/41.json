Moreover, the `_fit_predict` method in the `PolyFit` class in `seaborn/_stats/regression.py` directly uses the data without checking for or handling missing values before proceeding with `np.polyfit`. This context suggests that no built-in mechanism within the currently identified methods is specifically handling missing data, highlighting a potential gap in the current implementation regarding robustness to missing data.
