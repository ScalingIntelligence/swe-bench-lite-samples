The traceback suggests that the error is occurring in the `PolyFit._fit_predict` method within the `seaborn/_stats/regression.py` file. This method uses `np.polyfit` to fit a polynomial to the data, which fails due to the presence of `None` values. The search results confirm that this method does not currently handle missing data, and the same code span is present in both the file context and the search results. It is evident that the relevant code span for addressing the issue of missing data handling is the `PolyFit._fit_predict` method where the `np.polyfit` is called. However, the method does not currently check for or handle missing values. Therefore, the identified span is relevant to the reported issue, and it is likely that this span needs to be modified to ensure missing data is either handled or filtered out before calling `np.polyfit`.",

Alternatively, numpy's masked array module could also be used to handle missing values in arrays by treating them as masked values which can be ignored in computations. These methods should be considered for integration into the _fit_predict method to ensure robustness against missing data.",
