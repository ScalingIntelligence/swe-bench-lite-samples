The associated traceback indicates that the error arises from the invocation of np.polyfit within the PolyFit._fit_predict method, which fails due to the presence of None values (representing missing data) in the input data. This corroborates that the core functionality related to handling missing data, especially within the _fit_predict method, needs to be revised. To address this issue, code spans pertaining to the PolyFit class initialization and the specific fitting method ( _fit_predict ) which involve interaction with np.polyfit should be reviewed and potentially modified. Analysis of the current file context reveals no pre-existing relevant files, indicating scope for immediate modifications based on newly found relevant code spans. Reviewing the provided search results, specifically the spans labelled with 'imports' and 'PolyFit' correctly identify areas within the codebase that will be crucial to initiate any necessary changes. Thus, these are immediately indispensable for the task at hand. Exploring 'Plotter._compute_stats' does not appear directly relevant based on current understanding, as it does not involve specific handling of missing data or inclusion of None values in the PolyFit calculations. However, deeper engagement with all the identified code sections is crucial to ensure all relevant elements related to said reported issue are understood adequately for formulation of effective solutions.",

The initial file context provided includes the PolyFit class definition, which hints at where the issue might be in the codebase. The search results include several files and code spans. Among them, seaborn/_core/plot.py has sections related to computing statistics, scaling and unscaling coordinates, which might interact with the regression functionality.

The other files, such as seaborn/utils.py, seaborn/matrix.py, and seaborn/distributions.py, do not seem directly relevant to the reported issue.

The current context shows that PolyFit relies on numpy's polyfit to perform polynomial fitting, which is sensitive to missing data. The search results confirm this, showing that PolyFit directly uses numpy's polyfit method without any handling of potential missing data. The _fit_predict method in PolyFit should be responsible for data preprocessing to exclude missing values.
