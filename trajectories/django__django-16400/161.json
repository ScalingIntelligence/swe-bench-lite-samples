The issue states that after a successful migration run, there is a subsequent DB read request that does not respect the specified database parameter, leading to unintended behavior with a custom DB router. This suggests that there might be code within the 'migrate' command or related areas that do not properly pass or consider the database parameter when making DB calls.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant files and code spans are:\n1. `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py`: This file contains the core logic for the 'migrate' command, including argument parsing and the main handling function. The span ID 'Command.add_arguments' is particularly relevant as it shows how the --database parameter is added to the command, indicating its intended use.\n2. `django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py`: Although primarily related to loading data fixtures, its handling of database parameters could be relevant if there's an interaction during migration operations.\n3. `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py` and `django/core/management/commands/flush.py`: While not directly related to the issue, they provide context on how other commands handle database parameters, which could potentially reveal underlying patterns or bugs.\n\nFrom these findings, the most directly relevant code spans are in `migrate.py`, particularly the 'Command.add_arguments' and 'Command' itself, which encapsulates the entire logic of the command and how it interacts with databases. Further investigation within the 'handle' function in migrate.py is likely needed to identify any discrepancies in how database parameters are passed and respected during migrations.",

This leads to a DB read request that does not use the specified database but resorts to the default database, especially when dealing with multi-tenant setups using custom DB routers and thread-local variables.\n\nFrom the context provided, the 'migrate' command script already shows a method to add arguments to the command, which includes a --database parameter. This parameter nominates a database for synchronization.\n\nIn the new search results provided, the `django/db/utils.py` file contains valuable information. Specifically, the `ConnectionRouter` class and its methods (`db_for_read`, `db_for_write`, `allow_relation`, `allow_migrate`) could likely interact with the custom DB router implementation outlined in the issue. These methods are crucial for routing database operations according to the database specified or implied by the context. The `ConnectionRouter` class uses a `routers` property that retrieves routers either from the settings or built-in routers if not specified otherwise, aligning with the custom DB router described in the issue.\n\nBased on this analysis, the code related to `ConnectionRouter` in `django/db/utils.py` is highly relevant because it directly addresses the core functionalities expected to be modified or checked to resolve the reported issue. It aims to handle database routing appropriately, which is a key part of solving the problem related to the 'migrate' command using the wrong database.\n\nGiven the command's default behavior, it is essential to ensure that the database specified as a parameter is effectively used throughout its execution, which the `ConnectionRouter` class appears to be capable of doing. This understanding suggests that modifying or utilizing these specific parts of the code is likely to help resolve the problem.",

The issue describes a scenario where a DB read request runs after the migration, not respecting the db param and invoking the DB router. This behavior is unexpected, especially for a multi-tenant service that relies on a custom middleware and DB router to manage different tenants.\n\nGiven the context, the focus is on identifying the parts of the codebase that control the behavior of the migrate command and the interaction with database routers. The provided search results include the definition of the ConnectionRouter class in 'django/db/utils.py'. This class is critical as it mediates database operations based on the routing configuration defined in the settings. The class includes methods to choose databases for read and write operations, manage relations between objects, and control migration actions.\n\nGiven the issue's nature, the identified span in 'django/db/utils.py' seems relevant as it directly addresses how database routing decisions are made, which is central to the reported problem. Specifically, the ConnectionRouter class, with its methods for routing database operations, aligns with the custom TenantDatabaseRouter mentioned in the issue. Understanding how these routers interact with the migrate command could provide insights into the observed behavior of read operations not respecting the specified database.\n\nSince the ConnectionRouter class is a fundamental part of Django's database handling and its methods correlate strongly with the actions that are failing to respect the database parameter during migrations, the identified span should be considered relevant.",
