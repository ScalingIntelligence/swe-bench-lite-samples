The provided code spans from the 'migrate' command in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' highlight several key areas: the 'Command' class, its 'handle' method (where the database parameter is processed), and the migration progress callback. These parts of the code are crucial as they deal directly with the migration process and the handling of the database parameter. Additionally, the code from 'django/db/utils.py' provides context on how the database routers are initialized and used, which is relevant given the custom DB router setup mentioned in the issue.

The 'migrate' command's implementation in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and the database routing logic in 'django/db/utils.py' need to be further investigated. Specific methods like 'executor.migrate' and '_create_project_state' within the 'migrate' command should be inspected to ensure they adequately honor the database parameter.

The provided context includes code spans from `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` and `django/db/utils.py`. The search results also include relevant code spans from `django/db/utils.py`. It appears that the critical function here is the `ConnectionRouter`, which routes database operations based on the configured routers. The key methods are `db_for_read` and `db_for_write`, which delegate these decisions to the routers. Given the issue description, it seems that the method `_router_func` is central to the problem, as it contains logic for routing database operations based on the action (read or write) and the router configurations. Specifically, the `db_for_read` and `db_for_write` methods are likely the ones used by the migration command to decide which database to use for read and write operations, respectively. However, there seems to be a potential issue where the specified database parameter during the command execution might not be consistently respected across all DB operations. The identified code spans are relevant as they pertain to how database routing decisions are made, which could be the source of the problem described.

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
