It seems that a read operation by the DB router uses a thread-local variable instead of the database specified in the command. The provided custom middleware and router suggest the importance of using the database parameter correctly. Given the detailed context provided, I reviewed the `migrate.py` file in the search results, particularly focusing on the 'Command.handle' span, which is responsible for handling the migration process. Key elements to identify include where the database parameter is used and how DB operations are invoked during the migration process. The code in 'Command.handle' shows the handling of the database option, the execution of migrations, and signals related to the pre and post-migrate stages. This span appears relevant as it directly relates to the issue reported, especially since it deals with processing the specified database parameter and the migration execution. Identifying this span would help to understand how the database parameter goes through the process and where any deviations might occur between specified database usage and actual DB calls using the router. Therefore, the span identified as 'Command.handle' is relevant for diagnosing the underlying issue affecting database parameter handling during migrations.",

The user provided a minimal example showcasing the custom middleware and DB router setup. In the provided search results, the main focus should be on identifying any code spans that deal with database routing, especially database reads during migration processes. There are code spans related to database routing in 'django/db/utils.py' and handling of migrations in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py'. We need to examine these to see if they provide insights into how database parameters might be getting disregarded or how db reads might be interfering post-migration.\n\nThe 'ConnectionRouter' class and its methods in 'django/db/utils.py' are likely relevant, as they handle database routing. Specifically, the methods for database reads ('db_for_read') and writes ('db_for_write') are important to review. In 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', the 'handle' method of the 'Command' class, where the migration command's main logic resides, is particularly relevant for understanding the context of database operations during migration.
