This issue is particularly relevant in a multi-tenant service context where a custom DB router is used. The provided search results include relevant code from the `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` file, specifically the `Command` class and its `handle` method, which process the migrate command options, including the database parameter. This code is crucial as it directly involves the handling of the database during migrations. Additionally, the `utils.tenant_db_router` module mentioned in the issue setup is not present in the search results, which might be a critical part of the custom DB router setup for the multi-tenant system. The `django/db/utils.py` file includes a `ConnectionRouter` class, which seems relevant to the DB routing based on the context of the issue but does not directly address the specific problem of respecting the database parameter during the migrate command. Therefore, while the search results provide useful context, additional code spans related to the actual custom DB router setup (as outlined in the issue) would be necessary to fully address the problem.

The file context provided includes key areas such as the 'handle' method in the 'migrate' command and the 'migrate' method in the 'MigrationExecutor' class. These areas are critical for understanding how the migration process is managed and how the database parameter is intended to be respected. The presence of the 'emit_post_migrate_signal' method in the 'handle' method of the 'migrate' command is particularly relevant, as it is suspected to trigger DB read operations that might not respect the specified database parameter. This aligns with the issue's description where a DB read request does not respect the database parameter set during the management command. Given this analysis, the file context sufficiently addresses the problematic areas related to the reported issue. Further investigation into the 'emit_post_migrate_signal' method and its interactions with signal receivers, especially those in the custom database router, would be crucial for identifying and resolving the issue. As such, the relevant file context for addressing this issue has been provided.",
