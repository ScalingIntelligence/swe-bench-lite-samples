The issue involves a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service and suggests that all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified. Upon analyzing the provided code spans, the relevant section appears to be the `Command.handle` method in the `migrate.py` file, which processes the migration command and handles the database parameter. Additionally, the `ConnectionRouter` class in `db/utils.py` is also relevant as it manages the routing of database operations, including the `allow_migrate` method used to determine if a migration is allowed on a database.

Specifically, a DB read request runs after the migration that does not respect the db param and invokes the DB router. The issue is critical for a multi-tenant service using a custom DB router and middleware.\n\nTo address this, the relevant code spans must focus on the 'migrate' command logic and the custom DB router implementation. Given the context provided and considering the nature of the issue, the focus should be on the 'handle' method of the 'migrate' command and the 'allow_migrate' method in the custom DB router.\n\nThe initial analysis of the provided file context reveals critical sections: \n1. 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' - Specifically, the 'Command.handle' method contains the logic for handling the migrate command. This method is crucial for understanding how the database parameter is passed and handled during the migration process.\n2. 'django/db/utils.py' - This file contains the 'ConnectionRouter' class, which has the 'allow_migrate' method. This method is significant because it dictates how the migration is allowed on a particular database based on the custom DB router's logic.\n\nFrom the search results, the key sections identified are:\n1. 'django/db/utils.py' - The 'ConnectionRouter' class is again confirmed to be critical. The 'allow_migrate' method within this class needs to be reviewed to ensure it respects the custom logic defined in the 'TenantDatabaseRouter' or any similar custom router class.\n\nBased on the available search results and the nature of the issue, additional context or search results might be necessary to fully identify all relevant code spans and the root cause of the issue. Further investigation into how the 'migrate' command interacts with middleware and custom router logic might also be necessary.",

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
