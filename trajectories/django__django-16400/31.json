The problem is observable when a database read request occurs after a successful migration, which does not use the specified database and instead invokes the database router. This behavior is unexpected as all DB calls in the context of the 'migrate' command should use the database specified. The issue seems to be related to the TenantDatabaseRouter or the way the database parameter is handled in the 'migrate' command logic. The relevant Django modules appear to be 'django/db/utils.py', 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', and possibly the 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' for the creation of permissions.",

The `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class in `django/db/backends/base/base.py` is the base class for database connections, including how connections are initialized, managed, and closed, which can be crucial for understanding database interactions during command execution.\n\n3. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` is directly related to routing database operations, which includes methods like `db_for_read` and `allow_migrate`, potentially responsible for the kind of behavior mentioned in the reported issue.\n\nThese classes and methods are directly relevant to understanding the context in which the 'migrate' command fails to respect the database parameter, especially in how database operations like reads are routed and how the command handles and executes migrations.\n\nIdentifying and understanding these parts of the Django framework will provide the necessary context to diagnose and potentially fix the issue with the 'migrate' command not respecting the database parameter.",

This indicates a potential issue with how the database parameter is handled during the migration process, particularly in the context of the custom DB router and middleware for a multi-tenant service. The search results provide insights into the implementation of the migrate command and its interactions with the database. The 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file contains the 'Command' class which is responsible for handling the migration process. Within this class, the 'handle' method is crucial as it orchestrates the migration based on the provided options, including the database parameter. This method sets up the connection and executor, and it could be the point where the custom DB router (TenantDatabaseRouter) should be leveraged to ensure the correct database is used. Given the provided context, it seems relevant to focus on the 'handle' method in the 'Command' class to ensure that the database parameter is respected throughout the migration process, especially when dealing with permissions post-migration. This involves checking how the database parameter is passed and used within the method and ensuring that any subsequent DB read operations adhere to this parameter to avoid invoking the default DB router unintentionally.",

This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
