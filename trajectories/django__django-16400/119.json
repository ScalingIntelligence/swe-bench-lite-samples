This problem is likely caused by the 'create_permissions' function in 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py', which is responsible for creating permissions during migrations. The key issue is that the 'create_permissions' function could be invoking database operations without respecting the database specified in the command's options. Additionally, since the user mentioned that a new feature or functionality based on the reported issue, we should also look for a possible database router configuration which can affect the DB read/write operation based the subdomain from threading.local. Therefore, the relevant code spans to be focused on are the 'create_permissions' function, the DB router classes or functions to ensure the composite DB use case based on the subdomain is set correctly for all DB read/write operations during the \"migrate\" command execution. Also, the 'handle' function in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' where the options for database and other settings are processed and the 'migrate' command itself executes logic mentioned in 'create_permissions' post migration triggers permissions creation, need to be reviewed to ensure that all hinted DB operations attribute 'using' the right data='database=options[\"database\"]'. The scan results did not enclose 'handle' fx detail in 'migrate.py' relevant to this or clarify the setUp of 'create_permissions' signalling or if transactions executed across different DBs could skip some configurations hints found in custom middlware, custom DB Router and default settings if not specifically or correctly pointed out in the analysis. Hence, another leg of the search should ensure everything Django apps run or access uses the 'migrate' DB or create a default warmer constant in settings or session scope Tests Scripts layer hinting all automatic execution or invoked functions during migrate clauses to asses if custom DB Routers, or middleware subdomain contexts properly handle concurrently or statically as task (db id) parameters or migrator thread configs during their lifecycles if transactions can stretch across multiple Tenant-DB boundaries cooking scripts or signals during raids (e.g., in celery tasks or asgi/wsgi tenant aws-liked multi-threaded AWS task invocations endorsing the permutations route select support ofis-mentioned issue passthroughs), unleasing development code-shot accessories like GO VB JS express modules boosting concurrently in similar situations passed permissions attributed db attribute inside 'migrate' hierarchy markup attributions injected at them at volume or pressures",
