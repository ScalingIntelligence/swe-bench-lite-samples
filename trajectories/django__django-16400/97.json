The issue specifically mentions that these read requests invoke the custom DB router and do not use the database specified during the command execution. There are several key elements identified in the reported issue: 1. The custom middleware and DB Router setup. 2. The usage of a thread-local variable to get the active DB. 3. The expected behavior where all DB calls in the context of the migrate command should use the specified database. 4. The printing of 'read {}' before the exception message which indicates that the custom DB router is being accessed. 5. The minimal example provided showcases how the custom middleware and DB Router are set up in a multi-tenant service scenario. From the context and new search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans should be focused on within the 'migrate.py' file and the 'db/utils.py' file as these are directly related to the management command and the DB routing. The 'migrate.py' file contains the implementation of the migrate command, while the 'db/utils.py' file pertains to DB connection handling and routing. After analyzing the new search results, it becomes clear that the code spans identified in the <file_context> tags and the new search results in the 'db/utils.py' file are relevant to the reported issue. These code spans cover the initialization of the ConnectionRouter and the methods for reading and writing to the database, which are critical for understanding how DB routing is handled and how it might be interfering with the specified database parameter during the migrate command. Therefore, the task is complete as we have identified the relevant code spans in both the 'migrate.py' and 'db/utils.py' files that are pertinent to the reported issue.",
