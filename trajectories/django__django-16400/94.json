This results in a DB read request that does not honor the specified database, leading to the invocation of the custom DB router. The issue involves a custom DB router and middleware for a multi-tenant service, where a thread-local variable is used to manage the active database. The search results present the `migrate.py` file from `django/core/management/commands/` which contains the `Command` class and the `handle` method. This method is crucial for processing the database migrations and handling the specified database parameter. It is evident that the `handle` method includes operations related to setting up the database connection based on the options provided during the migration command execution. Specifically, the line `connection = connections[database]` sets up the database connection based on the database option. This section of code is clearly relevant to the reported issue as it involves handling database-specific operations during the migration process. The context of the current search indicates that the identified code span directly addresses the issue related to respecting the database parameter during migrations. This aligns with the concern that DB operations might not be respecting the specified database, as outlined in the issue description.

This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
