The custom DB router and middleware are critical components here, as they handle tenant-specific database routing. The middleware sets the subdomain which is used by the router to choose the correct database. However, a subsequent read operation does not respect the specified database parameter and triggers the custom DB router, leading to potential issues, such as the InvalidTenantException. Given the nature of the problem, focusing on the 'migrate' management command file and any related DB router files in Django core is crucial.",

From the provided search results, it's crucial to examine the code where the `migrate` command handles the database parameter and any related read operations. Particularly relevant is the `Command.handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py`, where the database option is processed and migrations are executed. Additionally, we should check the `TenantDatabaseRouter` and middleware to make sure they correctly handle the database context during the `migrate` command execution. Based on the search results, the following spans of code are relevant: `Command.handle`, `Command.sync_apps`, and `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate`. These segments deal with handling the database for migrations, syncing applications, and allowing migrations respectively. They are directly related to the reported issue concerning the database parameter not being respected during migrations.

This issue is critical in multi-tenant services where isolating database operations by tenant is essential. The provided context contains parts of the migrate command and the DB router, which are key to resolving this issue. The search results primarily focus on the migrate command and the DB router. The 'Command.handle' in the migrate command is essential as it manages the database parameter handling during migration. The 'ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate' in the DB router class is also relevant since it controls which models are allowed to be migrated to specific databases. Considering the issue, the identified code spans seem relevant to help trace and potentially resolve the issue by ensuring that all DB calls in the context of the migrate command respect the specified database. Further analysis of how these spans interact with other parts of the codebase, such as middleware, is necessary to fully address the issue.",
