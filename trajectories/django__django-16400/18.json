The custom router, TenantDatabaseRouter, has methods like db_for_read and db_for_write that are expected to use the specified database. The provided code spans from the 'migrate.py' and 'utils.py' files are relevant because they handle database connections, migrations, and interaction with routers. Specifically, the 'migrate.py' file contains the Command class with the handle method, which is central to the execution of the migrate command and its interaction with databases. This method sets up the database connection based on the provided options and interacts with the MigrationExecutor. The 'utils.py' file contains the ConnectionRouter class, which handles routing to different databases based on the rules defined by custom routers, such as TenantDatabaseRouter, as specified in the settings. This class's methods are crucial for directing read and write operations to the correct databases. These code spans are relevant as they directly relate to how database operations are managed and routed within Django, which is central to the issue reported. They provide the necessary context to understand how the custom router might be interacting with the migrate command and where the discrepancy in using the specified database parameter might occur.",

I need to identify code spans that handle the migration process and database routing to see if they align with the reported issue regarding respecting the database parameter. \n\n1. I reviewed the current context in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' specifically focusing on the 'Command.handle' method which manages the migration execution, including setting the database from options and initializing the MigrationExecutor. This section seems relevant as it deals with database setup and migration execution.\n\n2. I examined the new search results in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' again, focusing particularly on how the database is set and used throughout the migration process. The code sets the database from options, initializes connections, and uses a MigrationExecutor with these connections.\n\n3. I also looked into 'django/db/utils.py' which contains the ConnectionRouter handling database routing decisions like 'db_for_read' and 'db_for_write'. This seems relevant as it directly involves the database routing strategy.\n\n4. Examining the ConnectionRouter's methods in 'django/db/utils.py' such as 'allow_relation' and 'allow_migrate', I conclude these are vital for determining if they influence the issue about respecting the database parameter during migrations.",

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
