The provided search results contain several relevant code spans across different files that are involved in the migration process and database routing in Django. The key files and code spans to focus on are those related to the `migrate` command handling and the database routing logic, specifically `db_for_read` and `allow_migrate` methods in the `ConnectionRouter` class. These sections are critical as they determine how and which database is chosen for read operations and migration actions. The `migrate` command's handling logic in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` is also essential as it defines how the command processes and executes migrations, including the setting of the database connection.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the provided search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the `migrate.py` and `utils.py` (assuming the custom DB router logic is in a file named `utils.py` based on typical Django app structure) files. These spans include the `handle` method of the `Command` class in `migrate.py`, which is responsible for executing the `migrate` command, and the `db_for_read`, `db_for_write`, and `allow_migrate` methods in the `TenantDatabaseRouter` class, which dictate the database routing behavior.",

It specifically mentions the use of 'connections[database]' and 'connection.prepare_database()', showing that the command is designed to use the specified database.

After reviewing the file context and search results, several relevant code sections have been identified. The first file, 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', contains the core logic for the migrate command, which involves handling the database parameter and executing migrations. This file is crucial because it directly addresses the reported issue by specifying how the database parameter is processed and what operations are performed in the migration process. The other relevant file identified is 'django/db/utils.py', particularly the 'ConnectionRouter' class, which plays a significant role in database routing based on the provided hints such as db_for_read and db_for_write.

However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
