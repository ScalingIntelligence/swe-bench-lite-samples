It is suspected that a DB read request runs after the migration that does not respect the database parameter and invokes the DB router. The custom DB router provided uses a thread-local variable to get the active DB for a multi-tenant service, and the problem arises when the specified DB is not consistently used in all DB calls during the migration process. Given the issue, it's important to focus on the interactions between the 'migrate' command and the custom DB router, as well as how database parameters are handled in these interactions.",

The analysis of the provided <search_results> involves inspecting the 'migrate.py', 'base.py', and 'utils.py' files.\n\nInitially, in 'migrate.py', the 'Command.handle' method is heavily reviewed as it deals directly with command execution and database parameter handling. It sets up the database connection based on the provided options and processes migrations. The 'sync_apps' method within 'Command' is also examined for DB interactions beyond migration execution. \n\nIn 'base.py', focus is on 'BaseDatabaseWrapper' to understand how thread sharing and database connection management occur, particularly relevant if threading might interfere with the expected DB specified by the command.\n\nLastly, in 'utils.py', the 'ConnectionRouter' class governs database routing, which is crucial for understanding how read and write operations are directed to databases. The '_router_func' within 'ConnectionRouter' determines database selection for various actions like read, write, and migration.\n\nBased on the detailed examination, the identified spans relate to critical areas where the database parameter is handled, connections are managed, and database routing decisions are made. This should cover the essential parts of the codebase relevant to ensuring the 'migrate' command respects the specified database.",

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
