            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue describes a problem where the 'migrate' management command in Django does not respect the database parameter when performing certain DB read operations after the migration. This inconsistency can lead to issues when working with multi-tenant databases where the context (here represented as 'subdomain' in a thread-local variable) is used to determine the database, and the specified database during the 'migrate' command execution is expected to be respected for all operations.\n\nThe provided search results present the code from 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', which includes the `Command` class handling the logic for the 'migrate' command. Key parts of this code relate to command argument handling, the execution of migrations with respect to databases, and progress callbacks during the migration process. Notably, the `handle` method which processes the migration includes acquiring and managing a database connection based on the provided database parameter. However, the issue indicates that there might be DB read operations after this migration execution that do not respect this database parameter.\n\nGiven the issue's context and the identified code spans, it suggests investigating further into how and when DB read operations occur in the migration process, especially post-migration operations. Additionally, understanding the integration of custom middleware and database routers with Django's migration execution would be crucial. This includes reviewing sections where the migration operations are planned (`migration_plan`), executed (`migrate`), and how the state management (`ProjectState`, `ModelState`) interacts with database choices.\n\nAt this stage, several spans from the 'migrate.py' file appear tightly related to how the 'migrate' command operates and how database parameters are intended to be respected. Marking these spans as relevant, with anticipation that further code may involve database-specific operations that could rectify or explain the reported issue.",

This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
