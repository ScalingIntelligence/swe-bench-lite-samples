This suggests that there might be a DB read request after the migration that does not use the specified database. To address this, we should look into the `migrate` command's handling of database parameters and the logic that might trigger additional DB reads post-migration. Focusing on the `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` and related DB utility files like `django/db/utils.py` is a good starting point.",

The 'migrate.py' file contains the code for the 'migrate' command itself, which includes handling arguments, executing migrations, and syncing apps with the database. This file is directly relevant to the reported issue as it is where the migration process is controlled and database parameters are processed. The 'utils.py' file is related to database handling utilities, including the ConnectionRouter class with methods for reading and writing to databases across multiple routers. This is also relevant as it could influence how the database parameter is respected during migrations. Both files include code spans that might address the issue of the database parameter not being respected during migrations, especially the 'handle' method in 'migrate.py' and the various methods in 'ConnectionRouter' class from 'utils.py'. The search task is likely not complete as further analysis of the deeper interactions between these methods and the custom TenantDatabaseRouter might be necessary to fully resolve the issue.",

These methods are responsible for processing the migration command, including the handling of the '--database' parameter, which is crucial for the issue at hand.

This class and its methods are involved in deciding which database operations are allowed based on the database and app configurations. The 'allow_migrate' method is particularly relevant as it determines if a particular migration is allowed on a specific database. \n\nTaking all this into account, I will select the relevant code spans from the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file that are directly related to handling the database parameter during the migration process to help address the reported issue.",
