This could arise from an unwanted DB read request which inadvertently triggers custom DB routers and middleware setups intended for handling multi-tenant operations.\n\nThe investigation should focus on the handle method of the Command class in the 'migrate' command script, as this is where management of the database parameter and migration execution initiation occurs. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class, especially the allow_migrate method, is crucial as it deals with database routing decisions which can inadvertently lead to the use of unintended databases.\n\nFrom the provided code spans, several critical components related to database handling are identified: \n- 'Command.handle' in 'migrate.py' where the management command options like 'database' are processed.\n- 'ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate' in 'utils.py' which can potentially introduce unintended database interactions.\n\nThese areas are pivotal in understanding and rectifying where the specified database parameter might not be correctly permeating operation execution sequences, therefore predisposing to undesired cross-database interaction particularly concerning permissions which should rightly shield tenant data integrity.",
