Specifically, there is a DB read request that occurs after the migration which does not respect the db parameter and invokes the DB router. This behavior is unexpected as the database should be specified during the management command. The relevant code might be found in the database utility files, management command files, and possibly in the auth management files where permissions are handled. Searching for code related to database routing, specifically the 'db_for_read' and 'db_for_write' methods in 'ConnectionRouter', and within the 'migrate' command class in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' could yield the necessary code to understand and fix this issue.",

This issue is critical as it affects the functionality of the 'migrate' command in a multi-tenant setup where the database specified should be used for all DB operations. \n\nThe relevant code spans identified from the search results are primarily from the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and 'django/db/utils.py' files. In 'migrate.py', the 'Command' class and its 'handle' method are relevant as they deal with the processing of the 'migrate' command and handling of the 'database' parameter. In 'utils.py', the 'ConnectionRouter' class and its methods are relevant as they define how database routing is handled, which is critical for the reported issue. Specifically, the 'db_for_read' and 'db_for_write' methods in the 'TenantDatabaseRouter' class (as described in the issue) need to respect the database parameter passed to the 'migrate' command. These sections of code will help in understanding how the database parameter is currently being processed and how the DB router is being invoked, which will guide further modifications to address the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the 'TenantSubdomainMiddleware' and 'TenantDatabaseRouter' classes provided in the issue context are also relevant, as they define the middleware and router logic used in the multi-tenant setup. These classes are not found in the provided search results, but they are essential for understanding the custom DB routing logic that is not respecting the database parameter during migrations. This context can be used to implement the necessary changes in the relevant parts of the Django codebase.",
