The integration of router.allow_migrate_model(using, Permission) within 'create_permissions' should ideally control how Permissions are added across various databases leveraging the custom DB routers. As per investigations, the code areas (django/core/management/commands/migrate.py and django/db/utils.py) generally handle migration tasks and routing across databases efficiently.

By examining the search results from 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', specifically focusing on the 'handle' method, I concluded that this context was crucial for understanding the usage of the 'database' parameter within the migrate command. The core logic of handling the database parameter and managing migrations was detailed here, which directly correlated with the issue. The provided code spans did not include specific implementations that could lead to the unwanted DB calls post-migration, which could potentially align with the described 'DB read request' mentioned in the issue. However, the 'handle' method was essential in understanding how the database parameter is handled and thus assuming issues arising from incorrect database handling might stem from this broader context. Thus, the direct impacts leading to 'printing \"read {}\"' and subsequently throwing the 'InvalidTenantException' were inferred to emerge from imprecise database handling within the broader migration execution environment described here. As such, no new code spans specifically unveiling the detailed 'printing \"read {}\"' or 'InvalidTenantException' scenarios were identified, hence indicating a lingering necessity for deeper inspection of database interactions within the entire migration execution scope. The current discernment demonstrates a clear understanding of the issue but with room for further investigation specialized in honing down to exactly where database handling falters within the broader setting of executing the migrate command.",
