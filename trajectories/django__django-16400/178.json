The issue specifically mentions that a DB read request runs after the migration, which does not respect the db parameter and invokes the DB router. This indicates a need to ensure that all database operations within the context of the migrate command adhere to the specified database.\n\nIn the provided search results, several code spans are relevant:\n1. The 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' indicates the main logic for handling the migrate command. It includes methods for processing arguments, handling the command execution, and managing the migration process. The '_default_db' method in the 'TenantDatabaseRouter' class in the issue description also hints at the custom DB router used for multi-tenant service.\n2. The 'create_permissions' function in 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' is relevant because it involves the creation of permissions, which could potentially be where the DB read request occurs that doesn't respect the db parameter.\n3. The 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' is also important as it manages the routing of database operations, which should align with the specified database.\n\nThese spans cover the main logic for the migrate command, the process of creating permissions post-migration, and the handling of database routing. They should help in understanding and potentially resolving the issue where the db parameter is not respected during certain DB operations after running migrations.",
