The `migrate.py` file contains the `Command` class which defines the `migrate` management command, including the `handle` method where the database parameter is parsed and used. Additionally, `django/db/utils.py` contains the `ConnectionRouter` which is initialized with routers and might be relevant for understanding how the DB router is chosen.

The issue describes a scenario where a DB read request runs after the migration, ignoring the specified database parameter, leading to potential issues with custom DB routers and multi-tenant services.\n\nStep 2: Reviewing the current file context, it appears that the `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` file already contains relevant code related to the `migrate` command, including imports, command class, and handle method. There is also a reference to the `django/db/utils.py` file which might contain database utility functions related to connections.\n\nStep 3: Processing new search results:\n3.1. `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py`: This file contains the `Command` class and its methods such as `handle`, `migration_progress_callback`, `sync_apps`, and `describe_operation`. These methods are directly related to the execution of the migrate command and handling communication with the database during migrations.\n3.2. `django/db/utils.py`: This file contains the `ConnectionRouter` class which might handle database connections and routing, potentially relevant to the issue at hand if it involves different databases or tenants.\n3.3. Since the migrate command and its handling where identified, it's essential to check if the identified spans maintain the context where a specified database is supposed to be used consistently.\n3.4. - 3.7: The code sections identified do include handling database selection and preparation, which is crucial considering there should be no DB calls made that ignore the specified database. The link to multi-tenant models confirms why these sections of code are significant in the context of this issue.\n4: The analysis is completed as relevant code spans in the search results have been found and matched with the context of the reported issue.",

The search results provided include relevant sections of the 'migrate' command, such as the 'add_arguments' method where the '--database' parameter is defined, the 'handle' method where the command logic is executed, and the 'sync_apps' and 'describe_operation' methods. It's essential to review these since they are central to the operation and could reveal how the database parameter is used or potentially misused.

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
