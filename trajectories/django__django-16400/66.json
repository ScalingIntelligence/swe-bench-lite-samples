This behavior is problematic in multi-tenant setups where a custom database router is utilized to manage tenant-specific databases. The migration process should respect the database specified in the command and not invoke the custom DB router for reads or writes that are not supposed to happen within the context of the migrate command.\n\nReviewing the search results, two key files are found: 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and 'django/db/utils.py'. In 'migrate.py', the 'handle' method of the 'Command' class is analyzed to see how it processes the database parameter and the migration execution. The method assigns the database from options, sets up the connection, and uses the MigrationExecutor to manage migrations. This is relevant as the issue may stem from how the database parameter is passed or handled during the migration execution.\n\nThe 'django/db/utils.py' file contains the 'ConnectionRouter' class, which is responsible for routing database operations based on settings and custom routers. This includes methods for reading, writing, allowing relations, and managing migrations. The setup and behavior of these methods are crucial to understand if and how the custom router is interfering with the migrate command even when a specific database is specified.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans are crucial for investigating why the 'migrate' command is not respecting the database parameter, potentially due to interactions with the custom DB router.",
