The issue involves custom middleware and a custom DB router for multi-tenant service, which should ideally not be called when a database is specified. The search results include relevant sections from the `django/db/utils.py` and `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` files. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` contains methods that handle database routing, including `db_for_read` and `db_for_write`, which are relevant to the custom DB router described in the issue. The `Command` class in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` includes the `handle` method, which is central to the `migrate` command's execution and contains logic to handle the database parameter. The identified spans are relevant to understanding the database routing and the execution of the migrate command, potentially pointing to where the issue might be occurring or where a fix could be applied. Additional investigation may be needed to fully diagnose and resolve the issue, possibly involving checking middleware and other involved components explicitly mentioned in the issue setup.",
