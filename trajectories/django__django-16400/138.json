This is critical for multi-tenant services using a custom DB router and middleware to handle tenant-specific databases.\n\nUpon analyzing the provided search results, several key sections of code are relevant to the issue. Firstly, the 'create_permissions' function in 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' directly involves the creation and handling of permissions during migrations, which could potentially be where the issue lies regarding database respect. The 'Command.handle' method in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' is another critical part as it handles the execution of the migrate command, including the database parameter processing.\n\nAdditionally, 'ConnectionRouter' in 'django/db/utils.py' is crucial as it manages database routing decisions that could influence the database used during migrations or permission creation. The '_router_func' method in this class encapsulates the logic for routing reads and writes, which may indirectly influence the behavior under discussion. Overall, these sections provide a good starting point and context to further investigate and potentially resolve the issue of the 'migrate' command not respecting the database parameter when adding permissions.",

The key areas of interest include the `create_permissions` function in `django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py` and the `Command.handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py`. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` also plays a crucial role in managing database routing, particularly the `allow_migrate` method. These code spans and methods are analyzed to determine their relevance to the reported issue of database parameter misalignment during migrations. The `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate` method is particularly important as it controls the permission to migrate models to a specified database. The `Command.handle` method orchestrates the overall migration process, including initialization, conflict detection, and execution of migrations. The `create_permissions` function, although not directly found in the search results, is mentioned in the context and is likely to be relevant due to its role in creating permissions after content types are created. Given these insights, it is essential to verify the proper handling of the database parameter throughout these methods to ensure that all DB calls respect the context specified during the migration process.",
