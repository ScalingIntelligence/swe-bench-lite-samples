This issue is described in detail, especially focusing on the custom DB router and middleware used for multi-tenancy. Key elements include handling the database parameter in the migrate command, the custom TenantSubdomainMiddleware, and the TenantDatabaseRouter. During analysis, it was observed that the middleware is setting a thread-local variable for the subdomain, and the router is relying on this variable to determine the database for read and write operations. The search results include code spans from `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` and `django/db/utils.py`. From `migrate.py`, the `Command.handle` method is relevant as it processes the database parameter. From `utils.py`, the `ConnectionRouter` class, its initialization, and methods like `db_for_read` and `db_for_write` are relevant since they handle routing decisions based on models and hints. These code spans collectively suggest places where the database parameter could be inadvertently ignored or overridden, particularly relevant to the custom router's logic. It's important to analyze how the thread-local variable interacts with these routes to understand why the specified database is not always respected. The identified spans offer a detailed view into the logic of the migrate command and database routing, which is crucial for identifying the root cause of the reported issue.",
