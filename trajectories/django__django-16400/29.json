Analyzing the provided search results, the most relevant portion of code seems to be in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', specifically the 'Command.handle' method, which is responsible for handling the 'migrate' command and its options. This method sets up the database connection based on the provided options, including the database parameter. It also initializes the MigrationExecutor which controls the execution of migrations. Another relevant part is the 'allow_migrate' method in 'django/db/utils.py' within the ConnectionRouter class, as it determines which DBs are allowed to have migrations applied. These two code spans seem most relevant as they deal directly with how the migrate command interacts with databases and migrations, which are central to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration.
