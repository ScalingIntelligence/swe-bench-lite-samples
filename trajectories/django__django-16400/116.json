The description points towards an anomaly where a read request after migration does not adhere to the database parameter specified. This misbehavior could be linked to the interaction between the custom DB router and the middleware handling tenant contexts. To diagnose and potentially fix this, we need to look into the core 'migrate' command logic, specifically the part where it handles database parameters and initiates migrations. We should also scrutinize the custom DB router and middleware to ensure they correctly interpret and apply the database context under different conditions, especially during migrations.",

Although these are not directly provided in the search results, they were described as part of the minimal example and are crucial for understanding the context of the issue. The second is the handling of the database parameter during the migrate command execution. The provided search results include the Command class from `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` and a relevant section from `django/db/utils.py` which are related to the database management and migration strategies in Django.\n\nThe `Command.handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` is particularly relevant as it deals directly with fetching the database from options, preparing the database, and executing migrations with a specific database connection. This method is expected to manage the database specified by the user during the command's execution, which is critical for this issue.\n\nThe `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate` method from `django/db/utils.py` is also pertinent. This method is involved in routing the migrations based on the database configurations, which could explain why additional DB reads occur outside the intended database context. This part of the code might influence how migrations are directed to the appropriate databases and could be a place where the issue of respecting the database parameter occurs.\n\nThe identified code spans in these files are thus relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the issue related to the migrate command not respecting the database parameter. They can provide valuable context and concrete areas to investigate when trying to ensure that migrations strictly adhere to the specified database parameter.",
