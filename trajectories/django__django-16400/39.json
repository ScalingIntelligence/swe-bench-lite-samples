This occurs despite the database being specified during the command invocation. The provided code spans in the search results from 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and 'django/db/utils.py' can be relevant to the issue, particularly because they involve the handling of the 'migrate' command and the management of database connections and routers, which are central to the issue described. The 'Command' class in 'migrate.py' handles the logic of the 'migrate' command, including parsing command-line arguments such as the '--database' parameter. It also involves database synchronization and migration operations. The 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'utils.py' is likely to be related to the custom DB router mentioned in the issue, responsible for managing database routing based on specific rules or contexts such as multi-tenant setups. These code spans could help in identifying where the database parameter is being handled and how read operations might be bypassing the specified database. Further investigation into these spans might reveal whether the issue is due to an oversight in applying the database parameter to all read operations or if there is an issue with the custom router logic.",
