The issue mentions that a DB read request runs after the migration, which does not respect the db param and invokes the db router, leading to unexpected behavior. The provided search results contain relevant code spans, particularly in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' where the 'Command' class handles the management command and its arguments, including the database parameter. Additionally, 'django/db/utils.py' contains code related to the ConnectionRouter and its allow_migrate method, which is central to routing database operations. Finally, 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' includes the 'create_permissions' function, which is directly related to the permission addition mentioned in the issue. These code spans are relevant as they deal with the handling of database parameters in the context of migrations and permission creation. Based on the analysis, the following code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
