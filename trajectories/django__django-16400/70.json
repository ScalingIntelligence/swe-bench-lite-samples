Specifically, it mentions that a DB read request runs after the migration, disregarding the database parameter and invoking the DB router. The provided context does not have relevant code identified yet. Analyzing the search results, the `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` file contains several spans that may be relevant to the issue. The `Command.add_arguments` span shows the parsing of the `--database` parameter, which defaults to the 'default' database. This parameter is essential as it determines which database the migration should target. The `Command.handle` span includes the implementation of the handle method, which processes the migration based on the provided options, including the database option. This span is particularly relevant as it contains the logic for executing migrations and ensuring the correct database is used. The `Command.migration_progress_callback` suggests the implementation might interact with the database but does not directly address the issue of respecting the database parameter after migration. Therefore, the analysis focuses on the 'Command.add_arguments' and 'Command.handle' spans as they directly deal with database parameter handling and migration execution.",

The former contains the implementation of the 'migrate' command, including argument parsing, command handling, and the actual execution of migrations, which directly relates to the reported issue. The latter file involves a ConnectionRouter class, specifically its 'allow_migrate' method, which is critical for determining database routing during migrations. These code spans are relevant as they deal with the database management and routing aspects that are central to the issue.

However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration.
