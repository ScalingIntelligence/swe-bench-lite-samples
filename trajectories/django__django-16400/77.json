From the search results, the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file contains the 'Command' class which is responsible for the migrate command. The 'handle' method within this class is particularly relevant as it processes the database option and initiates database operations. Additionally, the 'sync_apps' method and the 'migration_progress_callback' method are identified as they deal with application synchronization and migration progress, which might also involve database interactions. The 'django/db/utils.py' file contains the 'ConnectionRouter' class which manages database routing, which is crucial for understanding how database operations are directed. The 'routers' property and various routing methods like 'db_for_read', 'db_for_write', 'allow_relation', and 'allow_migrate' are pertinent as they dictate which database to use for various operations, potentially explaining why certain operations might not respect the provided database parameter. The 'allow_migrate' and 'get_migratable_models' methods could be particularly relevant in the context of migrations and specifying databases. These selections are made considering they directly handle or influence database selection and interaction during migration processes, which are central to the reported issue.",
