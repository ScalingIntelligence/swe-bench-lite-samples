Specifically, there's a concern that a DB read request is made after the migration that does not respect the specified database parameter. This problem is particularly critical in multi-tenant setups where the correct database selection is crucial. The provided context points to middleware and a custom database router (\"utils.tenant_db_router\") as potential areas of concern. As the initial search, it's essential to focus on the 'migrate' command and database routing logic in Django to pinpoint where the database parameter is disregarded during migration.",

This suggests that there might be a DB read request that runs after the migration, which does not respect the db param and invokes the db router. This issue is particularly relevant in a multi-tenant service with a custom DB router and middleware to handle tenant-specific databases.\n\nIn the search results, the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file contains several relevant code spans. The 'handle' function in the 'Command' class specifically deals with executing migrations and handling the database parameter. This is where the migration command's interaction with the specified database should be controlled, suggesting relevance to the issue.\n\nThe 'django/db/utils.py' file includes the 'ConnectionRouter' class, which is responsible for routing database operations based on the model and hints. The functions 'db_for_read', 'db_for_write', 'allow_relation', and 'allow_migrate' in the 'ConnectionRouter' class are all relevant as they determine which database to use for various operations. These functions align with the issue of ensuring that the correct database is selected during migrations.\n\nGiven the identified code spans, it appears that the search results have relevant code pertaining to the management of database parameters during migrations and the routing of database operations.

Given the context and the code spans in the search results, we can identify relevant sections that deal with database routing and the handling of migrations.\n\nFrom the `file_context`, the `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` file is crucial as it contains the `Command` class definition and its methods used to handle the `migrate` command execution. This includes the `handle` method, which orchestrates the migration process, and the `sync_apps` method, which synchronizes apps without migrations. Integral to this process is the interaction with the database router to determine which database to use for read and write operations.\n\nIn the `search_results`, the `django/db/utils.py` file provides more insight into the `ConnectionRouter` class, which is responsible for implementing database routing based on the provided routers. This includes methods like `db_for_read`, `db_for_write`, `allow_relation`, and `allow_migrate`, all of which are pertinent to the issue as they dictate how database operations are routed.\n\nConsidering the issue at hand, it's clear that the `migrate` command should respect the specified database and not veer off to unintended databases. The focus should be on how the `migrate` command interfaces with the database router and how it determines the database for various operations. Specifically, looking at how the `db_for_read` and `db_for_write` methods in `ConnectionRouter` are implemented and used within the `migrate` command's execution flow.\n\nTherefore, the search results include key sections of the `ConnectionRouter` class that might be causing the issue when the `db_for_read` or `db_for_write` methods are invoked during the migration process. This aligns with the reported problem of a DB read request not respecting the db param.",
