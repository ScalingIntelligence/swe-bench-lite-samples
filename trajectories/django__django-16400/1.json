There's a specific concern about a DB read request happening after the migration that ignores the db parameter and uses the default DB router. This suggests a need to examine how the 'migrate' command executes and how permissions are added, focusing on any read operations that might bypass the specified database.\n\nThe search results include code from Django's core management commands ('django/core/management/commands/migrate.py') and database utilities ('django/db/utils.py'), which are directly related to handling migrations and database routing. Additionally, the code for creating permissions ('django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py') is relevant as it involves database operations that could be affected by the issue. It's crucial to inspect the 'handle' method in the migrate command and the 'create_permissions' function, focusing on how they perform database reads and writes. This includes looking at where the database parameter is set and how it's used in subsequent operations. By examining these parts of the code, particularly around the use of the router and specifying the database, we can identify where the issue might be occurring.\n\nThe identified spans are 'Command.handle' from 'migrate.py', as it orchestrates the migration process, including handling the database parameter. Also, the 'create_permissions' function from '__init__.py' is relevant for the post-migration operation reported in the issue. This selection aims to cover the sequence from migration execution to the creation of permissions, ensuring we address the reported issue at all relevant stages.",
