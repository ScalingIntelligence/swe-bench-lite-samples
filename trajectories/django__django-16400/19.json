This discrepancy occurs due to a DB router being invoked that is not context-aware of the database parameter passed to the migrate command. The user provides a minimal example of the custom middleware and DB router setup they use in a multi-tenant Django application. The provided search results focus on the 'handle' method of the 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', which is responsible for processing the migration command and its arguments, including the database parameter. The method sets up the connection to the specified database and executes the migration plan, but it does not explicitly enforce or check how subsequent DB operations use this connection or whether they respect the initially specified database. This is the critical area to focus on as it relates directly to the reported issue of the DB router not respecting the database parameter. The provided context and search results align with the issue and suggest that further investigation into how DB operations are handled after setting up the connection in the 'handle' method is necessary. This includes ensuring that all subsequent DB calls within the migration process correctly use the database connection established at the beginning of the 'handle' method.",

The reported issue suggests that the migrate management command does not respect the database parameter when adding Permissions, specifically when triggering a DB read request after a migration that does not use the specified database. This seems to be related to custom middleware (TenantSubdomainMiddleware) and a custom database router (TenantDatabaseRouter) that rely on a thread-local variable for tenant-specific database routing.\n2. The file context provided includes `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py`, which has spans detailing the `Command` class and its `handle` method. This is the core logic of the migrate command, where the database is specified and the migration is executed. The identified spans are relevant because they show how the database parameter is handled and how migrations are processed.\n3. The search results include `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` with spans covering the `MigrationRecorder` class and its related methods. This class is responsible for tracking which migrations have been applied to which database. The provided spans reveal how the database alias is used in querying migrations, which directly relates to ensuring the correct database is targeted.\n4. Another file in the search results is `django/db/utils.py`, specifically highlighting the `ConnectionRouter` class and its methods for routing read and write operations. This is relevant to the issue because it demonstrates how Django's database routing mechanics work, which is critical for understanding how the custom database router might interact with the migrate command.\n5. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those from `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` that show the handling of the database parameter, and from `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` that detail database-specific querying of applied migrations. These spans are enough to understand how the database parameter is managed and how migrations are recorded, indicating that the search task is complete in identifying relevant code for the issue.",

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
