This is critical as it affects the multi-tenant setup with a custom DB router. The issue arises after the migration process, when there is an unexpected DB read request that doesn't use the specified database. The relevant code seems to be located in the Django core management commands and the database utils section. Specifically, the 'migrate.py' command and the 'ConnectionRouter' in 'db/utils.py' must be reviewed to ensure the database parameter is respected throughout the migration process, including post-migration DB operations. Additionally, the custom DB Router and Middleware implementation in the project's 'settings.py' and 'utils/tenant_db_router.py' should be checked for any flaws in the database selection logic.",

            "scratch_pad": "Upon reviewing the reported issue and the provided search results, it's clear that the issue centers around the management command 'migrate' not respecting the database parameter when handling permissions. This is particularly problematic when using a custom database router for multi-tenant services. The problematic behavior involves a DB read request made after the migration, which bypasses the specified database parameter and relies on the custom DB router instead. This goes against the expectation that all DB calls within the migrate command context should use the specified database.\n\nIn the first code file 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', the 'Command' class encapsulates the behavior of the migrate command. Key methods to examine are 'handle' and 'migration_progress_callback'. The 'handle' method processes the migration and could be the origin of the DB read that bypasses the specified database parameter. This is crucial since the issue specifically mentions a DB read occurring after the migration.\n\nThe second file 'django/db/utils.py' introduces the 'ConnectionRouter' class which is relevant to database routing. It includes methods that could affect database selection during reads and writes like 'db_for_read', 'db_for_write', 'allow_relation', and 'allow_migrate'. These methods interact with the database routers configured in settings.py, potentially leading to the scenario described in the issue where a read operation does not use the specified database. Detailed examination of these methods and how they interact with the 'TenantDatabaseRouter' in the reported issue is required to understand and address the mismatch between expected and actual database usage during command execution.\n\nGiven the current context, the relevant code spans identified focus on the critical methods in 'migrate.py' as potential points of intervention for ensuring the migrate command strictly adheres to the specified database parameter, thus preventing unintended reads or writes via a custom router not respecting this parameter.",

The 'migrate.py' file contains the implementation of the 'migrate' management command, which is critical for handling database schema updates, including post-migration operations. The 'db/utils.py' file includes the 'ConnectionRouter' class, which is responsible for routing database operations according to the rules defined in the project's settings, particularly the custom DB router. Given the issue description, the focus should now shift to the project-specific files mentioned: 'settings.py' and 'utils/tenant_db_router.py'. These files contain the custom DB router and middleware implementation that handle the specific database selection logic for the multi-tenant setup. It's essential to review these files to ensure the database parameter is correctly handled throughout the migration process and to identify if there are post-migration DB read requests that bypass the specified database.",

The relevant spans identified are the `Command.handle` and `Command.migration_progress_callback` which are central to the execution of the migrate command.\n\n2. **django/db/utils.py** - This file includes the `ConnectionRouter` class which is responsible for routing database operations to the correct database based on the settings and routers defined. The relevant spans here are the `ConnectionRouter.__init__`, `ConnectionRouter.routers`, `ConnectionRouter._router_func`, and `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate`, which are crucial for understanding how database routing decisions are made.\n\n3. **django/db/__init__.py** - This file sets up the database connections and routers, including the `reset_queries` and `close_old_connections` functions, which manage the cleanup of database interactions after requests.\n\n4. **django/utils/deprecation.py** - This file contains the `MiddlewareMixin` class, which is not directly related to the issue of database parameter handling in the migrate command.\n\nFrom the analysis, the key spans that are relevant to solving the reported issue are those in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and 'django/db/utils.py'.

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
