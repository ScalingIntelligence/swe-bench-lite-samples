Specifically, the `Command` class within the file handles the migration process. The `add_arguments` method adds the necessary arguments to the command, including the `--database` parameter. The `handle` method processes these arguments and sets up the migration executor with the specified database. Key responsibilities here include preparing the database, detecting conflicts, and handling migrations. Since the issue is related to a DB read request that seems to bypass the specified database, I reviewed the placement and usage of the database parameter to ensure it is correctly propagated through the migration process. Although the issue does not specify exactly where the disconnect occurs, the `handle` method and other related code sections are essential as they configure behavior and operations related to migrations. The migration process heavily depends on the `database` option, and any divergence from its usage would identify where the misalignment in database selection occurs.",
