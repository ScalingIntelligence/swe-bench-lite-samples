The expected behavior is that all database operations within the context of the 'migrate' command should adhere to the specified database parameter. This discrepancy is likely due to a misconfiguration or oversight in how the database context is set during the management command's execution. I should inspect the key files and methods responsible for handling database selection within Django's management commands and migration logic to identify where the database parameter might be ignored or incorrectly overridden.",

Additionally, considering the custom TenantDatabaseRouter, the methods db_for_read, db_for_write, and allow_migrate need to be scrutinized to ensure they correctly respond to the context set by management commands. Also, the interaction of thread-local variables like those managed by TenantSubdomainMiddleware with the database context could introduce unexpected behavior, complicating the maintainence of the intended database context during migrations. This could be particularly significant when considering multi-tenant setups with database routing decisions being tied to thread-local state. The next steps involve a deeper inspection of these points in the Django framework alongside the custom middleware and router to understand precisely where and how the database parameter is being potentially ignored or overridden.",

The key elements to consider are the handling of the database parameter in the 'migrate' command, and how the database router methods 'db_for_read' and 'db_for_read' are implemented and invoked. The current context shows part of the 'Command.handle' method in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' which deals with the database parameter. The new search results include relevant code spans from 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', 'django/db/utils.py', and 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py'. The 'Command.handle' span shows the migration handling logic, including the use of the 'database' parameter. The 'ConnectionRouter' span in 'django/db/utils.py' outlines the router logic, which is significant as it routes DB read/write operations. The 'create_permissions' span in 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' is critical as it is where permissions are actually created and the DB router might be invoked. Considering these, the relevant code spans in the new search results are 'Command.handle', 'ConnectionRouter', and 'create_permissions'.

The primary focus is on identifying the relevant code spans in the provided search results to understand how the 'migrate' command interacts with database routing and permission creation.\n\n1. Analyzing the reported issue, key elements include the 'migrate' command, database parameter handling, and how permissions are created and routed. This suggests a need to inspect the 'Command.handle' method in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' for database parameter handling, and the 'create_permissions' function in 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' for permission creation.\n\n2. Reviewing the current file context, the 'Command.handle' method is already identified, which is crucial for understanding how the database parameter is processed during the migration. This part of the code sets up the connection and executor using the provided database parameter.\n\n3. Processing new search results reveals additional relevant code spans:\n   a. The 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' is responsible for routing database operations and includes methods like 'db_for_read', 'db_for_write', and 'allow_migrate'. This aligns with the need to understand how database routing works in Django, especially concerning migrations.\n   b. The 'create_permissions' function in 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' explicitly checks and handles permission creation. The use of 'router.allow_migrate_model(using, Permission)' is particularly relevant as it determines whether the current permission model should be migrated based on the router's decision.\n\n4. Based on the analysis, the identified spans are consistent with the reported issue, covering the aspects of handling the database parameter, routing database operations, and the process of creating permissions during migrations.\n\nThe identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of how the 'migrate' command handles database parameters and how permissions are created and routed. This should help in addressing the issue concerning the database parameter not being respected during permission creation.",

However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
