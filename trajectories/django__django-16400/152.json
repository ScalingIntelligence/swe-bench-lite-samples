This problem likely arises due to a DB read request that occurs after migration, but it doesn't adhere to the specified database parameter. The custom middleware and DB Router setup for multi-tenant service might interfere with this handling. To debug this, we should focus on the 'migrate' command and related DB interactions, especially those using the custom DB router. We need to inspect the code where DB read operations occur during migrations to ensure they correctly use the specified database.",

The provided search results contain relevant code spans that deal with the handling of the 'database' parameter and the invocation of migrations. The 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' includes methods to handle arguments, specifically for the 'database' parameter in 'Command.add_arguments'. The 'handle' method processes these options and sets up the database connection based on the provided parameter. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue. Additionally, the 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' is crucial for routing database operations, including migrations. The '_router_func' and related methods in 'ConnectionRouter' are responsible for deciding database routing based on models and hints, which can influence the migration process. Specifically, the 'db_for_read' and 'db_for_write' methods in 'ConnectionRouter' are likely places where additional logic might need to be added or adjusted to ensure the 'database' parameter is fully respected during migrations, as described in the issue.

This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration.
