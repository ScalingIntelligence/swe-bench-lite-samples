Given the context provided, it's likely that the issue could be within the 'migrate' command itself or in the DB router handling during migration. To pinpoint the problem, search within the 'migrate' command and the DB routing utilities.",

This suggests that there might be a database read request after the migration that uses the default database instead of the specified one. To address this, I need to find relevant code spans that deal with handling the database parameter in the migrate command and how database reads/writes are managed during this process. \n\nIn the search results, the 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' appears relevant, as it defines the 'migrate' command and includes handling for the '--database' argument. Specifically, the 'Command.add_arguments' and 'Command.handle' methods seem crucial, as they define and process the database option. Furthermore, the 'Command.migration_progress_callback' and 'Command.sync_apps' methods might also be relevant as they deal with operations during migration. \n\nAdditionally, the 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' is relevant because it handles routing database operations based on the configured routers, which is crucial for understanding how database reads and writes are routed during migrations. Especially relevant are the 'db_for_read', 'db_for_write', and 'allow_migrate' methods, as they dictate which database should be used for read/write operations and migrations respectively.\n\nThese code spans provide a good starting point for understanding and addressing the issue, but further inspection of the 'django/db/migrations' module might be necessary to find more context or specific operations that could lead to the reported behavior of not respecting the database parameter.",
