The main files to look into are `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` and `django/db/utils.py`, as they contain key functionality for managing database migrations and routing. Specifically, the `Command.handle` method in `migrate.py` and the `ConnectionRouter` class in `db/utils.py` are critical. The `handle` method initializes the database connection and executes migrations, while the `ConnectionRouter` class is responsible for deciding which database to use for read and write operations based on the configured routers. Additionally, reviewing the middleware and settings related to database routing and management could provide more context or potential issues. The provided search results do not directly address the issue, focusing instead on middleware configurations unrelated to database routing during migrations.",

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
