This could be directly related to the database routing mechanism within Django, which determines how database operations are directed. Given this context, the most relevant code spans are those that involve managing database routing, specifically the 'allow_migrate' method and the routers' operations inside it. This seems to match the ConnectionRouter class within the django/db/utils.py file which is responsible for handling routing operations. It's crucial here to assess if the 'allow_migrate' function properly handles the database parameter to ensure all subsequent operations adhere to it. As no prior context exists, focusing on the ConnectionRouter class within django/db/utils.py appears most pertinent to this reported issue.

Specifically, there seems to be a DB read request that occurs after the migration, which does not utilize the specified database. This can lead to issues with multi-tenant services where the correct database context is crucial. The provided file context and search results offer insights into the relevant sections of the Django codebase that might be contributing to this issue. The 'migrate.py' command file contains the logic for handling the migrate command, including the 'Command.handle' method, which processes the database parameter. The 'db_for_read' and 'db_for_write' methods in the 'ConnectionRouter' class are also crucial as they determine which database to use for read and write operations. The issue might be related to how these methods are being invoked or how the database parameter is being propagated through the command execution chain. By examining these sections, we can better understand where the context might be getting lost or improperly handled.",
