The issue is compounded as the DB read request does not adhere to the custom DB router settings, leading to potential issues in multi-tenant setups. Given the issue's description, the primary concern is around ensuring all DB operations within the migrate command respect the database parameter. The provided search results offer insights into the 'migrate' command implementation within Django, specifically in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and 'django/db/utils.py'. Relevant code spans include the Command class's handle method which determines the database for the migration, the add_arguments method where the database parameter is defined, and the migration_progress_callback which manages the progress of the migration but does not directly handle the DB choice. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class in 'django/db/utils.py' oversees routing database operations based on the defined routers, which might indirectly influence how the migrate command interacts with databases. This analysis helps pinpoint the part of the code where the database parameter is accepted and used, confirming its relevance to the reported issue.",
