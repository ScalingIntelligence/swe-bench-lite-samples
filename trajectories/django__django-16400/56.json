The relevant code spans should surround the handling of the database parameter in the 'migrate' command and the database routing mechanisms to ensure that all DB calls, including reads, honor the specified database. The provided search results include several key files and functions related to database routing and the 'migrate' command. Specifically, the 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' encapsulates the logic for routing database operations based on the routers defined in settings. The 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' handles the actual execution of the 'migrate' command, including setting up the database connection. These two areas are critical for ensuring that the database parameter is correctly interpreted and respected throughout the migration process. The identified spans within these classes (`ConnectionRouter.routers`, `Command.handle`) are directly relevant to the issue, as they involve the initialization of routers and the handling of the 'migrate' command, respectively. These spans must be reviewed to ensure that the specified database is consistently used, particularly when read operations are performed. Additionally, other sections of code that reference or interact with the database connection and routers should be inspected to ensure no unintended default database usage occurs.",
