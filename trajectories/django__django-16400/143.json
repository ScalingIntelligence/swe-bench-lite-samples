To address this, it is crucial to identify the code sections responsible for handling the database parameter and the DB read requests during migrations.

The `handle` method includes logic for checking the database, preparing the database, and detecting conflicts, which could be relevant to the issue at hand.

The user has a custom DB router (TenantDatabaseRouter) and middleware (TenantSubdomainMiddleware) for a multi-tenant service, which seems to be causing the issue. The current file context shows the handle method in the migrate command, which includes database selection logic. The new search results include the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py, which is responsible for routing database operations based on routers defined in settings. The TenantDatabaseRouter class methods (db_for_read, db_for_write, allow_relation, allow_migrate) should interact with these routing methods to direct DB operations correctly. The search results provide insights into how Django's default routing mechanism works, possibly helping to identify where the custom router logic might be interacting incorrectly or where additional customization is required to ensure the database parameter is respected throughout the migrate command's execution.",
