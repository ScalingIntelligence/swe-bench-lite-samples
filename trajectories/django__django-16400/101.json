The problem is that after a migration, there is an unexpected DB read request that doesn't respect the database parameter, leading to unintended behavior with custom DB routers. To address this, one should focus on the parts of the code responsible for handling the database parameter in the 'migrate' command and the execution of DB read operations post-migration. Additionally, examining the custom DB router implementation for potential flaws in how it determines the active database is also essential. It's important to pinpoint where and how the database context might be lost or misunderstood within the migration process.",

The provided search results include relevant code in two files: 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py'. In 'migrate.py', the 'Command.handle' method is analyzed, which handles the execution of the migration command, including setting the database parameter, executing migrations, and dealing with permissions. The code related to the creation of permissions in 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' is also relevant, specifically the 'create_permissions' function, which involves reading from the database to create new permissions if they do not already exist. This function uses the 'Permission' model and checks whether to allow migration for this model using the 'router.allow_migrate_model' function. Both sections of code, especially the handling of migrations and the creation of permissions, are closely related to the issue as they involve the interaction with the database specified by the 'migrate' command. The analysis of the code spans suggests that the code related to handling migrations and creating permissions is relevant and needs further investigation to determine if the database parameter is correctly respected during these operations.",

The focus is on ensuring that when the database parameter is specified during the command, all DB operations should use the specified database. It's particularly important for multi-tenant services that use custom DB routers and middleware.\n\nFrom the given context, it's clear that the 'Command.handle' method in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' is the primary place where database interactions occur during migrations. However, the issue seems to lie in how Permissions are being created and if they respect the specified database.\n\nThe new search results include code related to middleware handling (e.g., 'CsrfViewMiddleware' and 'CommonMiddleware'), which is not directly relevant to the issue at hand as they handle HTTP request/response processing, not database operations. It's crucial to find code that deals with the creation or handling of Permissions, especially concerning the database sensitivity.\n\nGiven the context and the issue description, the relevant code span seems to be 'create_permissions' in 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' based on the function name. This function involves creating permissions, which ties directly to the reported problem in the migrate command. The method '_get_all_permissions' also seems relevant as it may be called during the permission creation process. Both of these spans should be evaluated and extracted for further assessment to determine how they interact with the database when the database parameter is specified.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the current context includes parts of the migration handling, more context on the custom DB router ('TenantDatabaseRouter') and middleware('TenantSubdomainMiddleware') implementation may also provide insights into why DB operations do not respect the db parameter during migrate actions.\n\nFor now, focusing on the core permission creation during migrations as outlined in 'create_permissions' should be sufficient to start addressing the issue.",
