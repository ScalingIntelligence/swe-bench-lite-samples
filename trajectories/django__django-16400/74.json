            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the `migrate` management command ignoring the database parameter during certain DB read requests. This is highlighted by the custom middleware and DB router setup, specifically designed for a multi-tenant service. The middleware sets up a subdomain and the router subsequently routes DB read/write operations based on this subdomain. The problem arises during migrations when a DB read request is made that does not respect the specified database parameter. This can cause unintended DB operations or exceptions in a multi-tenant setup which relies on the specific database for each tenant. Assessing the code where these DB read operations occur is crucial to understand if the specified database parameter is being correctly used, and whether any specific operations are inadvertently routing the DB requests.",

Specifically, it is noted that there might be a DB read request that does not respect the database parameter specified, which can lead to issues in environments that rely on custom database routers. To investigate this issue, I need to look at the relevant parts of the codebase that are used in the migrate command and the interaction with database routers, specifically focusing on the database parameter passed to the command and how it could affect any subsequent DB read calls.\n\nGiven the search results, the file `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` contains the `Command` class that defines the migrate command's behavior. With spans 'handle', 'Command.handle', and 'Command.migration_progress_callback' in particular relevant for analyzing how the command processes its database parameter and executes migrations. The reported issue specifically mentions that the db parameter may not be respected in all cases, which could be due to how the database is accessed after the migration command is executed. I should check if there's code in 'handle' or other related methods where manage database parameter safeguards or careful handling is required.\n\nThe search results also include `django/db/utils.py` which contains code related to managing database connections and routers, specifically the 'ConnectionRouter' class could contain logic that influences how databases are selected for read/write operations. Investigating `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate` and its related methods is important, as the problem description suggests that after the migrate command is run, there could be stray and unwanted DB request that doesn't pay attention to specified db parameter.\n\nAnother specific area is `django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py` which contains the `create_permissions` function. This function includes logic for creating permissions when migrations are applied, making this segment critical if there are nuances or bugs where read/write permissions and specific DBs connection handling can affect multi-tenants service.\n\nConsidering the portions of the code highlighted, the objective would be to identify spans within these classes/functions where more careful or deliberate handling of the database parameter (considering it has been specified) and implementation of thread-safe and DB routing implementing logic is highly required to pick out bits of code linked with multi-database setups and potentially custom DB routers overlooking behavior at database parameter specificity.",

This suggests an issue with how the database router determines which database to use for certain operations during the migration process. The provided search results include multiple files and code spans that are relevant to this issue. Specifically, the 'Command.handle' method in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' is where the 'migrate' command is actually executed. This method sets up the database connection and uses the MigrationExecutor to perform the migrations. Also, the 'allow_migrate' method in 'django/db/utils.py' shows how the connection router determines whether to allow migration operations on a given database. Furthermore, the 'create_permissions' function in 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' is relevant, as it is responsible for creating permissions during the migration process, and it directly uses the 'router.allow_migrate_model' method to check if permission creation is allowed on the specified database. Given these findings, the identified spans are sufficient to understand and potentially resolve the issue related to the 'database' parameter not being respected during migrations.",

The specific issue of the `database` parameter not being respected by certain post-migration DB read operations in the context of the `migrate` command was hinted at in the `migrate.py` and `__init__.py` files by the usage of `DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS` in the `create_permissions` function, which might override the specified database parameter.

This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
