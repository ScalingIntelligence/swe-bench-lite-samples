This is particularly problematic in multi-tenant scenarios where a custom DB router and middleware are used to determine the correct database based on the subdomain. The provided search results include several relevant files and spans of code:\n\n1. **django/core/management/commands/migrate.py**: This file contains the main logic for the migrate command, including handling the database parameter and executing migrations. The `Command.handle` method is particularly relevant as it processes the database option and interacts with the migration executor.\n\n2. **django/db/migrations/executor.py**: Here, the `MigrationExecutor.migrate` method is responsible for applying the migration plan. It takes the database parameter and processes it, which can help identify where the database parameter might not be properly respected.\n\n3. **django/db/migrations/autodetector.py**: This file contains the `MigrationAutodetector` class, which is used to detect changes in models and generate the necessary migrations. Specifically, the `generate_altered_db_table` method deals with altering DB tables, which could be related to the issue if there are incorrect DB reads during this process.\n\n4. **django/db/migrations/recorder.py**: The `MigrationRecorder` class is responsible for recording applied migrations. This can be relevant if the recording process involves DB reads that do not respect the specified database.\n\nThese spans of code provide a good starting point for investigating the issue. The next step would be to review the specific interactions with the database within these methods to determine if and where the database parameter is not being respected for DB read operations.",
