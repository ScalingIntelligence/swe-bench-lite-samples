This file contains the implementation of the `migrate` command, which is central to the issue as it's supposed to manage database schema changes while respecting the database parameter. In particular, the `handle` method within the `Command` class in `migrate.py` deals with executing migrations against the specified database. This directly addresses the part of the issue where migrations are expected to respect the database parameter. However, while the main context of the issue is covered, the specific point about the DB read request that runs after the migration and does not respect the db param is not explicitly detailed in the provided `migrate.py` code. There's no direct trace of the DB read operation post-migration that disregards the database parameter. The file context provided also includes `db/utils.py`, which is related to database utilities but doesn't directly touch upon the management of database reads during migrations. Therefore, while the main file for the `migrate` command is present and seems to handle the database parameter initiation properly, the exact problematic behavior described in the issue (DB read not respecting the db parameter after migration) is not explicitly identified in the provided code. More investigation is likely needed into the specific DB read operations involved post-migration to fully address the reported issue.",

This suggests that the DB router might be invoked incorrectly or that the thread-local variable used for determining the active DB might not be set as expected during the migration process. The provided context includes relevant code spans from the 'migrate.py' file, which handles the migration logic, and the 'utils.tenant_db_router' module, which defines the custom middleware and DB router. The new search results include code from 'db/utils.py', which defines the `ConnectionRouter` class and its `__init__` method. This class is crucial for handling database connections and routing, which could be relevant to the issue at hand. Given the context and the new search results, it appears that additional code related to DB routing and handling might need to be reviewed to fully understand and resolve the issue.",
