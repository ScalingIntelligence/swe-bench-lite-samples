The issue states that while the migration runs successfully, there is a subsequent DB read request that does not respect the provided database parameter, instead invoking the DB router. This discrepancy is problematic, especially in a multi-tenant service where a custom DB router is used with thread-local storage to manage tenant-specific databases.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, we find that the 'migrate' command is defined and implemented in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py'. The 'handle' method of the 'Command' class in this file processes the database parameter, sets up the connection, and executes the migration. This file is already in the context and contains the relevant logic for handling the database parameter and executing the migration.\n\nIn the new search results, we also find 'django/db/utils.py', which contains the definition of 'ConnectionRouter'. This class is responsible for routing database operations according to the rules specified in the DB routers. The methods 'db_for_read' and 'db_for_write' in 'ConnectionRouter' are particularly relevant as they determine which database should be used for read and write operations, respectively. This file is likely where the routing decisions are made, potentially disregarding the database parameter if the custom DB router logic is not correctly implemented.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, both 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and 'django/db/utils.py' seem relevant. The former is where the command's logic resides, and the latter is where the routing decisions are likely to be made.

However, looking closely at the 'handle' method, there isn't an explicit part that directly demonstrates or handles respective DB reads or writes. This omission suggests that the code might be missing crucial context regarding where, how, and when the DB reads occur post-migration. Additionally, understanding the interaction of 'migrate.py' with custom DB Routers like 'TenantDatabaseRouter' specified in 'utils.tenant_db_router' is essential. Still, not seeing these classes or their methods like 'db_for_read' in the provided context could mean overlooking significant parts of how DB routing during migrations works.

However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration.
