This behavior is unexpected as all DB calls in the context of the 'migrate' command should use the database specified via the 'database' parameter. The provided search results include the 'migrate' command's handle method in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py'. This method is responsible for handling the migration process, including setting up the database connection, checking for conflicts, and executing migrations. Initially, the method correctly sets up the database using the 'database' option provided. However, the issue might lie in how DB queries are made or propagated after this initial setup. Given the code provided, some areas that could be relevant to this issue include: how the database connection is used when executing migrations, how signals are emitted during pre and post-migrate phases, and how unmigrated apps and their synchronization are handled. These are areas that might inadvertently lead to the described situation of DB read requests not respecting the 'database' parameter. Therefore, the current search results provide a good starting point for investigating this issue, but further investigation is needed to identify the exact code span responsible for the described behavior, potentially in the logic that handles the execution of migration operations or signal emission.",

Notably, it includes the handling of the 'database' parameter, as evidenced by the lines setting the 'database' variable from options and using it to select a database connection. This indicates that the command is designed to work with a specified database during migrations. However, the specific issue reported, which concerns a discrepancy in database routing during migrations when a specific database is named, involves a custom database router and middleware that manage tenant-specific databases. The issue highlights that a read request after the migration does not respect the specified database. The file context provided does not include the custom middleware and router code mentioned in the issue description, which is crucial for understanding how the tenant database is being managed and how the migration command interacts with this setup. Therefore, while the provided `migrate` command file context is relevant, it does not completely address the issue without the context of the custom middleware and router. More investigation into how these custom components are invoked and how they interact with the `migrate` command could provide deeper insights into the problem and potential solutions.",
