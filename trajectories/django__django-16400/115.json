This happens in the context of a multi-tenant service where a custom DB router is used. The expected behavior is that all DB calls during the migrate command should respect the specified database. The crux of the problem seems to be in how the DB routing is handled during the migration process, especially with the custom middleware and router. Given the setup provided and the nature of the issue, searching for the custom DB router logic and the `migrate` command handling in Django core will be beneficial.",

This issue can be attributed to a DB read request that occurs after the migration, which does not utilize the specified database parameter, leading to the use of the default database as per the DB router. The search results provided from 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' contain several key sections that are relevant to this issue. Notably, the 'Command.handle' method is central as it manages the execution of the migration command, including the handling of database parameters and the actual migration process. Additionally, the 'Command.add_arguments' method is significant for its role in parsing command-line arguments, which would include the database parameter that needs to be respected. The 'Command.sync_apps' method, despite not directly being about migrations, could potentially influence how database operations are handled and therefore warrants attention. These sections collectively offer insight into how the 'migrate' command interacts with the database and handle parameters, making them relevant to addressing the issue reported.",

However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
