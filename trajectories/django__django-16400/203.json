In 'django/db/backends/base/base.py', the 'BaseDatabaseWrapper' class is defined, which is crucial for managing database connections. The '__init__' method of this class and other properties look relevant because they handle the initialization of database settings and alias. In 'django/db/utils.py', the 'ConnectionRouter' class is defined, which plays a role in determining which database to use for migrations. The 'allow_migrate' method in this class is particularly relevant since it decides whether to allow a specific database operation based on the configured routers.
