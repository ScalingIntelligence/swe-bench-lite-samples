This problem is critical for multi-tenant services using custom database routers and middleware for tenant-specific database selection. The provided file context indicates the involvement of various Django components, including the 'migrate' command itself, database utilities, and database routers. To debug this issue, I should focus on the specific interactions within the 'migrate' command that might lead to unauthorized database reads. Given that middleware and routers are custom-implemented, investigating the middleware handling and default database determination in the router might be pertinent. Additionally, since the 'migrate' command's data handling is central, examining the 'handle' method in 'migrate.py' and associated database access points will be paramount.",

To address this, we need to identify sections of code where the database specified during the management command invocation is not being adhered to, particularly when interacting with the database router. Analyzing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are within the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file. The 'Command' class and its 'handle' method are critical as they contain the logic for handling the 'migrate' command and interacting with the database. The 'handle' method includes sections where the database parameter is processed and where migrations are executed. This aligns with the issue reported, particularly the expectation that all DB calls in the context of the migrate command should use the database specified. Therefore, these code spans are relevant for understanding and potentially modifying the 'migrate' command to ensure it respects the database parameter. Additionally, the 'django/db/utils.py' file contains the 'ConnectionRouter' class, which is responsible for routing database operations and might also be involved in the issue if it does not correctly handle the specified database.
