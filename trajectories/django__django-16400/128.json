This could potentially stem from incorrect handling of database routing or middleware within the command's execution flow. To debug and address this, it's crucial to identify where the DB read request is initiated and why it bypasses the specified DB parameter. Focusing on the `migrate` command's implementation, relevant database utility functions, and the custom middleware/router setup is essential.",

The issue occurs after a successful migration, where a DB read request does not respect the db parameter and uses the db router, leading to unexpected behavior in a multi-tenant service using a custom DB router. The provided search results contain code spans that are relevant to understanding the control flow and database handling during migrations. The `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` file contains significant portions that handle the migrate command, including argument parsing, database connection management, and migration execution. The `django/db/utils.py` file provides context on how database connections and routers are managed, which is crucial for understanding the database routing behavior during the migration process. The `django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py` file deals with permission creation during migrations, which directly relates to the issue of permissions not being added correctly according to the specified database.",
