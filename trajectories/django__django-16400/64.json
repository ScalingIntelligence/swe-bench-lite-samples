This behavior is unexpected as the database specified in the management command should ideally be the one used for all operations within that context.\n\nThe code from `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` is relevant because it contains the implementation of the `migrate` command, particularly the `Command.handle` method where the database option is processed and the migration executor is instantiated. This part of the code is crucial for understanding how the database parameter is meant to be used and how the migration process is initiated. \n\nHowever, the provided code does not explicitly show where an additional DB read request might be initiated that does not respect the specified database. This missing piece is essential for resolving the issue since it suggests there might be a secondary database call that needs to be addressed to ensure it uses the specified database. Given the description, it's possible that further code inspection or logging within the `migrate` command might reveal where this unintended DB call originates. \n\nThe code from `django/db/utils.py` is also relevant as it relates to the handling of database connections and routers, which are critical components in how Django manages database interactions across different databases. However, the specific span provided does not directly address the issue of the additional DB read request, so it's marked as less relevant until more context is available. \n\nGiven the current information, it's advisable to focus on the `migrate` command's implementation to pinpoint the source of the additional DB read request and ensure that it respects the specified database. This will likely involve deeper inspection of how database connections are managed and how the custom DB router is initiated and used within the context of the `migrate` command.",
