The provided search results include code from `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` which is relevant as it contains the implementation of the `migrate` command, including the `handle` method where the database parameter is processed and the migration is executed. This file is crucial for understanding how the database parameter is used during the migration process. Additionally, the `django/db/utils.py` file contains the implementation of the `ConnectionRouter` class, which is responsible for routing database operations based on the routers specified in the settings. This file includes methods like `db_for_read`, `db_for_write`, and `allow_migrate`, which are directly related to the DB routing logic that might be causing the issue with the database parameter not being respected during certain operations. By analyzing these two files, we can identify the specific code spans that are relevant to the reported issue, particularly focusing on how the database parameter is handled and communicated to the DB router during the migration process.",

This is evident from the description, which highlights that after a successful migration with a specific database parameter, there is a subsequent DB read request that does not respect this parameter and instead triggers the DB router. The solution might involve ensuring that the database router is properly configured to use the specified database if explicitly provided during the management command execution. The search results provided contain key components including the 'Command.handle' and 'ConnectionRouter' classes and methods such as 'db_for_read', 'db_for_write', 'allow_relation', 'allow_migrate', and 'allow_migrate_model'. These elements are crucial for understanding how database routing works within Django and how it can be adjusted to strictly adhere to the database specified in the management command execution.\n\n1. Analyzing the reported issue, it's clear that a DB read request outside the context of the migrate command impacts the database specified. Examining the 'Command.handle' method, we find detailed steps on executing migrations based on user-specified database options, which is directly relevant to the issue.\n\n2. The 'ConnectionRouter' functionality, as outlined in the 'django/db/utils.py' file, including methods like '_router_func', 'db_for_read', 'db_for_write', and 'allow_migrate', should be scrutinized. This is important to understand how routing decisions are made and how they can be modified to ensure the specified database parameter is consistently adhered to within the migrate command context.\n\n3. The search results reveal key functionalities essential to address this issue, especially focusing on the parts of the code that interact directly with database selection in the context different operations like migrations and DB reads. The detailing of the methods in 'Command.handle' and 'ConnectionRouter' indicate the need to review how these methods use the specified database parameter to ensure uniform application across all requested operations.",

However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
