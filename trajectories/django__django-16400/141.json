Specifically, the 'migrate' command handling and the way it interacts with the database are detailed in the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file. Additionally, the 'django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py' file contains the logic for creating permissions. These files seem to cover the code related to the reported issue regarding the 'database' parameter and DB read requests during migrations. Further inspection of these files reveals that the 'db' parameter is explicitly handled in the 'migrate' command and the 'create_permissions' function, which are critical for the issue at hand. Therefore, the file context provided appears to be relevant and comprehensive enough to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
