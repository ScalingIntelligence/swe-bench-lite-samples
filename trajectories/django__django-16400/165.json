This seems to involve interactions with custom middleware and database routers related to multi-tenancy. The problem occurs during migration execution when a DB read request ignores the specified database and triggers the DB router. To pinpoint the issue, searches should focus on the 'migrate' command's handling of database parameters, custom middleware like 'TenantSubdomainMiddleware', and database routers. Additionally, it's important to identify any core Django functionality that might override or ignore the specified database in migrations. It's crucial to ensure that none of these components unintentionally use a default database when a specific database is provided.",

The 'migrate' command's handle method in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' is highly relevant as it deals with the execution of migrations, including handling the database parameter. The 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' is also pertinent, as it manages database routing, which is directly related to the custom DB router mechanism described in the issue. The '_router_func' method within 'ConnectionRouter' is particularly interesting as it determines the database to use for read and write operations based on the routers configured. Overall, these code spans provide a good starting point for addressing the issue by understanding how the database parameter is processed during migrations and how the custom DB router should interact with those processes.",
