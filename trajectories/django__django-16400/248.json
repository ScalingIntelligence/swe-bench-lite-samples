This can lead to inadvertent use of the default database instead of the specified one, which is problematic for multi-tenant setups. To address this, we need to identify the specific parts of the code responsible for handling database routing during migrations. We should focus on the 'migrate' command itself and the parts of the codebase responsible for database routing and managing the database context during management commands.",

This leads to a DB read request that bypasses the specified database and uses the default DB router settings. Given this context, the relevant code spans are primarily from the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file, where the 'migrate' command is defined and executed. The 'Command' class and its methods, such as 'handle' and 'migration_progress_callback', are crucial as they control the migration process and the interaction with the database. Additionally, the 'sync_apps' method could also be relevant if it involves database operations. The 'django/db/utils.py' file, containing the 'ConnectionRouter' class, is also relevant as it manages the routing of database operations according to the defined routers. The method 'db_for_read', which does not respect the specified database in the context of the 'migrate' command, stands out as specifically problematic and needs to be addressed to resolve the issue.",

This issue is critical for applications using custom DB routers for multi-tenant setups. Based on the provided context and search results, the relevant files and code spans are identified to address this issue. The analysis of the code spans showed that the migrate command is indeed handling the database parameter in its 'handle' method. However, further examination showed that the routers configuration is managed in django/db/utils.py, which should be examined to ensure that the router functions correctly with the specified database parameter. The ConnectionRouter class seems to be responsible for routing database operations and should be scrutinized for adherence to the database parameter provided in the command. No further sections were found in the search results that might handle the specific issue of permissions post-migration, so the current search is considered sufficient to investigate the reported issue.",

The new search results in `django/db/utils.py` and `django/db/__init__.py` provide additional context on database routing and connection handling, which are crucial for understanding how database selection is managed during migrations. Specifically, the `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` includes methods like `db_for_read`, `db_for_write`, and `allow_migrate`, which determine the database used for various operations based on the configured routers. Based on the analysis, the identified code spans from `django/db/utils.py` are relevant as they outline how database routing decisions are made, which directly relate to the issue of the 'migrate' command not respecting the database parameter during certain database read operations.

This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
