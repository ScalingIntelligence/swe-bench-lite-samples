This is causing unintended behavior in a custom DB router for a multi-tenant setup. The search results provide relevant code spans from the 'migrate.py' and 'utils.py' files, which are crucial for understanding how the management command operates and how the DB router is implemented. Specifically, the 'Command' class in 'migrate.py' contains the 'handle' method, which is the main entry point for the migrate command and includes logic for handling the database parameter and executing migrations. Additionally, the 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'utils.py' is responsible for routing DB operations based on the configured routers, which is directly related to the custom DB router mentioned in the issue. These code spans are highly relevant to the issue as they reveal the core logic behind the migrate command's interaction with the database and the router's role in determining DB operations.\n\nTo address the issue, it's essential to ensure that the database specified in the command is consistently used throughout the migration process, including any subsequent read operations. The identified code spans provide the necessary context to trace where the database parameter might be misused or overlooked, leading to the DB router being invoked unexpectedly. By examining these spans, one can pinpoint potential areas for modification to enforce the correct database usage during migrations.",

The relevant code spans should focus on the parts of the migration process where the database parameter should influence the database being targeted. From the provided search results, I observe that there are several potential entry points where the database parameter could be misused or inherited incorrectly, causing unintended database operations.\n\nAfter examining the file context and search results, it's clear that the `migrate.py` and `db/utils.py` files are at the core of the issue. The `migrate.py` contains the logic for handling the migrate command, which includes the initialization and handling of the database connection. The presence of the `handle` method in `migrate.py` could potentially override or ignore the custom database selection specified through the `database` parameter. Furthermore, the `db/utils.py` contains the `ConnectionRouter` class, often used in complex database setups, which might be misdirected by thread-local variables or other mechanisms in place for multi-tenant setups.\n\nGiven the use of a custom middleware and DB router as described in the issue, my focus should be on identifying code spans that directly interact with these customizations. This includes scrutinizing any parts of the Django core that might not properly integrate with the custom DB selection logic. Therefore, I should concentrate on the `handle` method in `migrate.py` and the `allow_migrate` method in `ConnectionRouter`, especially where these methods interact with optional parameters like `database`.\n\nAdditionally, considering the explicit example provided in the issue, I should ensure that the identified spans include any code that might implicitly read from the default database instead of the one specified. This would particularly involve checking any fallback mechanisms or default settings in the management command code. Therefore, the designated spans from the search results should encompass these critical areas in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` and `django/db/utils.py`.",

The issue is that a DB read request runs after the migration but does not respect the 'db' parameter specified during the command invocation, leading to the use of the default DB router. Reviewing the current file context and the new search results, we observe that the relevant code spans deal with the handling of database connections and migrations. The identified spans cover the 'ConnectionRouter' class and its methods, which are crucial for deciding which database to use for reading and writing in a multi-tenant environment. Although the existing context provides a good understanding of how the 'migrate' command handles database options, the newly identified span for 'ConnectionRouter' fills in the gap by showing how the router determines permission-related database usage. This additional context is important as it directly relates to the custom router behavior specified in the issue. Therefore, adding the relevant span from 'django/db/utils.py' to our identified spans should help address the reported issue more comprehensively.",
