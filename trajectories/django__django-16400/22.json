The main focus is on ensuring that database operations during the migrate command adhere to the specified database context, and not invoking unwanted db router calls.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant files are 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' and 'django/db/utils.py'. The 'migrate.py' file contains the implementation of the 'migrate' command, including the handling of database-related operations. Additionally, 'db/utils.py' includes the ConnectionRouter class, which is used for routing database operations to the correct database based on the router configuration.\n\nFrom 'migrate.py', the 'Command' class is identified as the core class responsible for executing the migrate process. Key spans include the 'handle' method, which contains the core logic for migrating databases, the 'db_for_read' and 'db_for_write' methods, which represent points where database operations are directed. The 'add_arguments' method is also relevant as it manipulates how arguments, including the 'database' parameter, are added to the command.\n\nIn conclusion, the relevant code spans from the provided search results include the 'Command' class definition, handle function, add_arguments method, and the 'db_for_read' and 'db_for_write' paths, which are crucial in implementing the 'migrate' process with respect to the database parameter, thus aligning with the reported issue.",

However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration.
