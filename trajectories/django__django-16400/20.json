Specifically, after a successful migration with a specified database, there is a subsequent DB read request that does not conform to the specified database parameter. This issue is significant for multi-tenant services using a custom DB router.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, particularly in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', the relevant code spans are identified as follows:\n\n1. The 'Command' class within 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' handles the logic for the 'migrate' command. Notable spans include 'Command.handle', 'Command.add_arguments', and 'Command.execute', which manage the invocation, arguments, and execution of the command. These are critical as they set up the database context (including the specified database parameter) and handle the migration process.\n\n2. The 'Command.handle' method is crucial as it processes the database parameter provided to the migrate command. It references 'database = options[\"database\"]', which directly correlates to the database parameter issue mentioned in the reported problem.\n\nGiven the identified code spans, they effectively demonstrate how the 'migrate' command operates concerning database specification and execution, directly relating to the issue reported.",

The file includes the 'Command' class with its 'handle' method, which handles the execution of the migrate command. This method processes various options, including the 'database' option, and it orchestrates the execution of the migration plan. The current file context indeed provides the relevant code for handling the 'migrate' command, which includes the logic for managing database connections, identifying migration targets, and executing the migration plan. The file context appears comprehensive enough to understand how the 'migrate' command interacts with database routing and how the database parameter is supposed to be used during the command's execution.

  "initial_message": "migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Vasanth)\n\t \nWhen invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .\nWhen naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.\nI came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .\nMinimal example \nSetup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that \"read {}\" is being printed before the exception message.\nIdeally none of this code must be called as the DB was specified during management command.\nfrom threading import local\nfrom django.conf import settings\nlocal_state = local()\nclass InvalidTenantException(Exception):\n\tpass\nclass TenantSubdomainMiddleware:\n\tdef __init__(self, get_response):\n\t\tself.get_response = get_response\n\tdef __call__(self, request):\n\t\t## Get Subdomain\n\t\thost = request.get_host().split(\":\")[0]\n\t\tlocal_state.subdomain = (\n\t\t\t# We assume single level of subdomain : app.service.com \n\t\t\t# HOST_IP : used to for local dev. \n\t\t\thost if host in settings.HOST_IP else host.split(\".\")[0]\n\t\t)\n\t\tresponse = self.get_response(request)\n\t\treturn response\nclass TenantDatabaseRouter:\n\tdef _default_db(self):\n\t\tsubdomain = getattr(local_state, \"subdomain\", None)\n\t\tif subdomain is not None and subdomain in settings.TENANT_MAP:\n\t\t\tdb_name = settings.TENANT_MAP[local_state.subdomain]\n\t\t\treturn db_name\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\traise InvalidTenantException()\n\tdef db_for_read(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"read\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef db_for_write(self, model, **hints):\n\t\tprint(\"write\", hints)\n\t\treturn self._default_db()\n\tdef allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n\t\treturn None\n## settings.py\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n\t\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantSubdomainMiddleware\",\n\t\"django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware\",\n\t...\n]\nTENANT_MAP = {\"localhost\":\"default\", \"tenant_1\":\"default\"}\nDATABASE_ROUTERS = [\"utils.tenant_db_router.TenantDatabaseRouter\"]\n"
