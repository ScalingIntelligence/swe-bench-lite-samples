This might be due to how the database router is being handled during the migration process.

Focusing on the `migrate` command and the database routing logic is critical to understanding and resolving this issue.",

The solution involves examining the code spans in the 'migrate.py' file that handle database-related operations, especially those that interact with the database parameter and the logic around it. The 'sync_apps' function in the 'migrate.py' file is of particular interest as it deals with the synchronization of app models and could potentially contain the logic that fails to respect the specified database. Additionally, the 'handle' function in 'migrate.py' should be scrutinized as it is the main execution point for the migration command and contains the logic for processing the database parameter options provided on the command line. An examination into how the 'database' parameter is used in these functions could help identify where the database specification is not being respected. Furthermore, the 'ConnectionHandler' and 'ConnectionRouter' classes in 'utils.py' also merit inspection, particularly the 'create_connection' and '_router_func' methods, which are involved in handling connections and routing according to the database specified.",

This is problematic for multi-tenant services where the database is specified during the management command. The provided context and search results primarily focus on the Django management command 'migrate' and its handling of the database parameter. The relevant code spans in the search results include portions of the ConnectionRouter class, which is responsible for routing database operations based on the current configuration. The ConnectionRouter's 'routers' property and '_router_func' method are particularly relevant because they determine how database operations are routed, potentially impacting the issue reported. However, there are no direct references to Permissions or explicit code related to the issue of migrations not respecting the database parameter in the provided search results.
