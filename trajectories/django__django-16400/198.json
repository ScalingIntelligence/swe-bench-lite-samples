The provided context suggests that the problem might be within the management command itself or how database routing is being processed during migrations. The minimal example provided involves custom middleware and a custom DB router, which should also be looked into to understand their interaction with Django's migration process.",

This behavior occurs after a successful migration. Given the critical nature of the 'migrate' command in managing database schema changes, it's imperative to examine how the command handles the database parameter and subsequent DB interactions. The provided search results primarily focus on the 'migrate' command implementation and the Django database routing mechanism. In the 'migrate' command, the 'handle' function initializes the database connection based on the provided options, which includes the database parameter. This setup is crucial for ensuring that all DB operations within the command context use the specified database. The database routing mechanism, encapsulated in 'ConnectionRouter', is also examined due to its involvement in determining which database should be used for read and write operations. The 'allow_migrate' method in the router is particularly relevant as it controls whether migrations should be applied to a given database. Based on the analysis of the search results and alignment with the reported issue, it appears that the identified code spans are relevant to the issue. Specifically, the 'handle' function in 'migrate.py' where the database parameter is processed and the database connection is established, and the various routing methods in 'ConnectionRouter' should be targeted for further investigation and potential issue resolution.",
