In 'django/db/utils.py', the ConnectionRouter class and its methods (db_for_read, db_for_write, allow_relation, allow_migrate, allow_migrate_model, get_migratable_models) are crucial as they handle database routing decisions. These methods could explain how the database parameter is or isn't respected during migrations. In 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py', the Command class and its handle method are central to understanding how the database parameter is used and passed around during the execution of the migrate command.

The user observed that after a successful migration, a DB read request runs that does not use the specified database, causing it to invoke the DB router instead. This is problematic for a multi-tenant service where the active DB should be detected using a thread-local variable and a custom DB router. To address this issue, it's crucial to ensure that all database calls during the migration process adhere to the specified database. The existing code analysis shows that the `handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` is where the migration command is executed. This method processes the database parameter and uses it to determine the migration targets. However, the issue might arise from subsequent calls or signals that bypass the specified database parameter. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` is also relevant, as it routes DB operations based on the router configuration, but the thread-local variable for determining the active DB isn't integrated in the provided snippets.

The user is using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service. After analyzing the provided context and search results, I see the following key points:\n\n1. The 'migrate' command logic is largely encapsulated in the 'handle' method of the Command class in the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file. This method deals with how migrations are executed, including the processing of database options.\n\n2. There are specific areas in the 'handle' method where the database parameter is either used or checked, such as when setting up the connection and preparing the database. This is relevant because the issue addresses how this parameter may not be fully respected in subsequent database operations.\n\n3. The methods 'emit_pre_migrate_signal' and 'emit_post_migrate_signal' are used, which suggests that the signals could potentially be a place where the DB handling might deviate or where additional custom handling might be needed.\n\n4. Given the reporting of specific issues related to database handling within the migration context, focusing on sections of the code that deal with database handling and signal emission seems most relevant to troubleshoot the issue further.\n\nBased on these observations, the identified spans in the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file that address code likely to be contributing to the reported issue are:",

The provided code spans are already relevant to the reported issue, covering database connection setup, migration execution, and the routing logic.
