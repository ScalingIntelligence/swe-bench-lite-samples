This could impact a multi-tenant setup where database routing is critical. Given the provided context, focusing on the 'django.contrib.auth.management.__init__.py' file, which contains the 'create_permissions' function, seems pertinent. Additionally, examining the 'migrate.py' command file to understand how the 'database' parameter is handled could provide insights. Finally, checking the 'tenant_db_router.py' file for the custom middleware and DB router implementation can help confirm their interaction and behavior during migrations.",

The functions `_get_all_permissions` and `_get_builtin_permissions` might also be relevant as they are involved in generating permissions.\n\n2. `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` - The `Command` class and its methods such as `handle`, `add_arguments`, and `migration_progress_callback` are all relevant as they deal with the execution of migrations, including specifying and processing the database parameter.\n\nThese selections are based on their direct involvement in managing database interactions during the migration process, which aligns with the described issue of database parameter handling.\n\nAdditionally, the file `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` may reference or interact with other parts of the codebase that handle database routing or permission creation, which will be important to ensure all relevant code is considered.",

The relevant code spans provided indicate that the `migrate` command is not consistently using the specified database for all operations, notably during the creation of Permissions. Specifically, there seems to be a post-migration DB read request that does not adhere to the specified database, leading to the invocation of the custom DB router. The `create_permissions` function warrants a closer look to ensure that all DB operations respect the `using` parameter. The current implementation has a segment where it correctly uses `Permission.objects.using(using).bulk_create(perms)` but it would benefit from scrutinizing other possible DB accesses to ensure they too respect the `using` parameter. Additionally, the custom middleware and DB router implementations provided in the issue description should be adhered to in handling tenant-specific DB routing. As a step forward, it would be prudent to validate all database accesses within the `create_permissions` function and potentially other related functions to ensure they incorporate the database parameter accurately.",

Critically, the reported issue is confirmed in the provided Minimal example where a custom DB router and middleware are in use. The issue surface during migration with specified DB parameters whereas the middleware causes the program to predictably deviate warning with db read request. This specific inconsistency is crucial. We have existing file context lacking in key components such as middleware error handling of default DB, custom DB router definitions when multiple DB exists, and migration handling procedures.
