The error message indicates that the same db_table name 'table_name' is being used by multiple models in different apps. This problem surfaced after upgrading to Django 2.2 and has forced a rollback to Django 2.0. The search results reveal relevant sections of Django's codebase concerning model field relationships (ForeignKey, ManyToManyField), schema editing (BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor, DatabaseSchemaEditor), and introspection (BaseDatabaseIntrospection). These sections include the definitions and initializations of classes and methods related to model relationships, database table management, and constraints. Notably, the 'ManyToManyField._check_table_uniqueness' method directly addresses the uniqueness of table names, which is central to the reported issue. These code spans are relevant as they provide insights into how Django handles table name uniqueness and model relationships, potentially indicating where conflicts might arise due to shared table names across models in different apps.",

The error message indicates that the 'table_name' is used by multiple models (base.ModelName and app2.ModelName) which is not allowed in Django 2.2 and later. The user needs to identify the relevant code spans responsible for handling table names in models, ensuring uniqueness across different apps' models. From the provided search results, several key areas were examined: 1. The ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes in django/db/models/fields/related.py which are central to defining relationships between models and implicitly or explicitly handle table naming through db_table parameters. 2. The check_all_models function in django/core/checks/model_checks.py which performs checks on all models ensuring that the db_table is unique across models. 3. Individual model definitions which were not directly provided but implicitly understood as relevant for the issue. Based on these factors, the search task is deemed complete as the identified code spans directly address the issue of table name uniqueness in Django models.",
