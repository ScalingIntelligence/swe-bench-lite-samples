The error message indicates that the `db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models`. This issue seems to be related to how Django handles model table names and their uniqueness across different databases and apps. After examining the provided search results, it's evident that there are several relevant code spans that address different aspects of this problem: 1. The `RelatedField` and `ForeignObject` classes in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` provide the base for handling relationships between models and could be relevant if the conflict arises from how relationships are managed when table names are duplicated. 2. The `ManyToManyField` class and its methods, such as `__init__` and `_check_table_uniqueness`, directly address the issue of table uniqueness, especially for many-to-many relationships, which could be causing the conflict in the reported issue. 3. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` provides methods for managing database tables, including renaming and altering table names, which could be used to resolve conflicts caused by duplicate table names. 4. The `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, specifically its method `generate_altered_db_table`, is responsible for generating operations that alter model tables in migrations, which is a key part of handling the table name conflict issue. These code spans collectively provide the necessary context and operations to understand and potentially resolve the duplication issue of table names across different Django models and apps.",
