The error message indicates that the same table name is used by multiple models, which is causing a clash. To address this issue, relevant code spans should include the definitions and operations related to table naming in Django's model and schema editor modules. The search results provided significant code spans in the context of Django's database operations, especially focusing on the management of table names, constraints, and operations. Relevant spans include definitions of ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, and their implementations concerning table uniqueness and constraints. The MigrationAutodetector's handling of altered table names during migrations is also crucial. The BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor's operations involving table renaming and column operations are also relevant regarding how Django handles changes in table structure as part of migrations. Overall, these spans offer a comprehensive view of how table names are managed in Django's model definitions and migrate operations, critical for addressing the reported issue.",

The `schema.py` and `autodetector.py` files also play key roles in schema management and migration operations, which are relevant to how Django handles table names during these processes.

We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names. \nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n"
