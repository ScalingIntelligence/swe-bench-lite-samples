The search results provide insight into how Django handles model creation and database schema management. The 'Model._check_column_name_clashes' method in 'django/db/models/base.py' is particularly relevant as it involves checking for column name clashes, which could be related to table name conflicts. Additionally, 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_db_table' in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' and its counterpart in 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py' are relevant because they deal with altering database tables, including renaming them, which is a potential solution to avoid table name conflicts.

This is confirmed in the provided file context, specifically in the `Model._check_column_name_clashes` method which checks for column name clashes across models. The context also includes relevant parts of the schema editor module where table alterations are handled. Although the specific error regarding the same table name across different apps (models.E028) isn't directly shown in the context, the code that validates model fields and their table names suggests that the conflict detection logic is implemented in a similar manner.

We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names. \nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n"
