The issue arises due to the restriction in Django 2.2 that disallows multiple models across different apps to share the same table name, even if they are in different databases. The error message specifically points to the models.E028 check, which likely enforces this uniqueness constraint. To resolve this, we need to locate the code responsible for checking the uniqueness of table names across models. The provided file context hints at several relevant files and methods within Django's model and migration classes that might be involved.",

The search results include relevant Django core files such as 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', 'django/db/models/base.py', and 'django/db/models/options.py'. In 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', multiple spans handle different aspects of ManyToManyField and its relationship with table names via db_table attribute. Specifically, the '__init__' span of ManyToManyField class initializes the db_table attribute and the 'deconstruct' method explicitly manages the persistence of db_table data on serialization which is directly relevant to the table conflict issue. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the '_check_column_name_clashes' method checks for column name clashes which indirectly relates to table uniqueness problem. In 'django/db/models/options.py', the Options class and its methods contribute_to_class manage model options including the db_table among others which are highly relevant to understanding and solving the table name conflict issue. Given the specific focus on table name conflicts and the presence of relevant code spans handling table names and model relationships, these spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
