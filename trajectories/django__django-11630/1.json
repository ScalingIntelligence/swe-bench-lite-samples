The error message indicates that the 'db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName'. The search results include several relevant code spans from the Django source code that handle model creation, database table naming, and unique constraint checks. The 'ModelBase' class in 'django/db/models/base.py' is particularly relevant as it defines how model classes are created and how conflicts in table names are handled. The '_check_column_name_clashes' method in the 'Model' class also checks for clashes in column names. Additionally, the migrations operations for renaming and altering models and fields, such as 'RenameModel' and 'RenameField' in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py', respectively, are relevant for managing changes to the database schema. The 'Apps' and 'AppConfig' classes in 'django/apps/registry.py' and 'django/apps/config.py', respectively, manage the registration and retrieval of models, which is essential for understanding how Django handles multiple apps and their models. These code spans collectively provide the necessary context to understand and address the issue of conflicting table names across different Django apps.",

Specifically, the `ModelBase` class in 'django/db/models/base.py' deals with model creation, checking for field and table name clashes. The migration operations such as `RenameModel`, `AlterModelTable`, and `RenameField` are crucial for handling table and field name changes which could be related to the issue of handling models with the same table name across different apps. The Apps registry and AppConfig in 'django/apps/registry.py' and 'django/apps/config.py' respectively provide mechanisms for app and model registration, which could influence how Django handles model names and table conflicts. Therefore, the provided file context appears to cover the critical areas where code related to the reported issue would be implemented or checked.",
