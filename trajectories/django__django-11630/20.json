The issue is that the same table name is being used in different apps pointing to different databases. This was not a problem in Django 2.0. The task is to identify the relevant parts of the Django framework that handle checking for unique table names across models and the logic that enforces this check. The search should focus on the ModelBase class, the Options class under django/db/models/options.py, and the check_all_models function in django/core/checks/model_checks.py as they seem to be involved in model and database table management.",

The error message specifically mentions the table name being used by multiple models, leading to a conflict. The search results provided include several key sections of Django's model handling code that are relevant to this issue.\n1. 'django/db/models/base.py' includes the `ModelBase` class, which is responsible for the creation of model classes. The `__new__` method within `ModelBase` handles the creation of new model classes and ensures that database table names are managed correctly, including checks for conflicts. The method is relevant because it's the point at which table name conflicts might be detected and reported.\n2. 'django/core/checks/model_checks.py' includes a function `check_all_models`, which registers a check for model-related errors, including conflicts related to database table names. This function is important as it actively scans for such conflicts and can generate errors when duplicates are found.\n3. 'django/db/models/options.py' contains the `Options` class, which manages metadata for model classes. The class includes methods and properties that directly affect how table names are set and managed for models. Specifically, the `contribute_to_class` method sets the database table name for a model based on its app label and model name, which is crucial for ensuring unique table names.\nGiven these findings, the search results provide a comprehensive view of the code that manages model creation and the assignment of database table names in Django, which is directly relevant to the reported issue of table name conflicts.",
