This error is triggered after upgrading Django, likely due to stricter model validation checks. The search should focus on identifying the specific checks and validations that Django 2.2 introduces to enforce uniqueness in db_table across models in different apps. Additionally, the search should look into migration operations and schema editors for any changes that might affect how table names are managed and validated.",

The error message indicates that 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName. This issue is relevant to the checking process in Django's model framework, specifically the part where it checks for column name clashes and model name db lookup clashes. From the search results, the base.py file contains relevant code spans such as 'Model.check', 'Model._check_column_name_clashes', and 'Model._check_model_name_db_lookup_clashes', which are directly related to the error message reported. These spans ensure that Django checks for potential clashes in column names and model names, which might cause the reported error. The 'Manager' class in the manager.py file is also relevant as it manages the objects of a model, but direct checks for duplicate table names are handled in the base.py file. The related.py file is less relevant as it handles relationships between fields, not clashes in table names. The other files like migrations and backends are tangential to the specific issue of duplicate table names but show how Django maintains and edits the database schema, which could lead to technical understanding if exploring deep fixes or features. Overall, 'base.py' contains the most relevant code for addressing the reported duplicate table name issue directly.",

The documentation mentions that, by default, Django automatically sets the `db_table` option to a value derived from the model's app label and model name. Therefore, any models with the same name within different apps will naturally result in the same `db_table` value unless explicitly overridden. This behavior is indeed designed to prevent data conflicts and ensure data integrity within a multi-database setup since the table names must be unique within a database. The error message 'models.E028' clearly indicates this constraint. Django raises this error to prevent potential conflicts between models that could lead to unpredictable behavior or data corruption. To resolve this, developers must ensure uniqueness in table names either by setting the `db_table` option explicitly for each model or by renaming models to be distinct within their respective apps. Thus, the search results need to focus on code sections that deal with the detection and response to such table name collisions, particularly in the context of model validation and error handling.",
