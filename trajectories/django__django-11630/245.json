This is particularly relevant post-upgrade to Django 2.2 and involves models in separate apps accessing different databases but sharing table names. The search results provide several relevant code spans: in 'django/db/models/base.py', there are multiple checks and error handling related to model field clashes, including '_check_field_name_clashes', '_check_column_name_clashes', '_check_model_name_db_lookup_clashes', and '_check_long_column_names'. These methods ensure that models do not have conflicting field or column names, which could be implicated in the reported issue. Additionally, in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', the '_check_table_uniqueness' method in the 'ManyToManyField' ensures that intermediary tables do not clash, which could also tie into the issue if multiple models were sharing many-to-many relationship tables. Furthermore, in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', the 'alter_db_table' method handles renaming tables, which might be necessary as a workaround to avoid table name clashes. All these spans of code directly or indirectly address aspects of uniqueness and clashes in model and table definitions, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.",
