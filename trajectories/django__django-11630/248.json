This is confirmed to be a new behavior in Django 2.2, which wasn't present in Django 2.0. The provided search results from 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' offer insights into how Django handles model uniqueness and table name assignments. Relevant code spans include '_check_field_name_clashes', '_check_column_name_clashes', and 'AlterModelTable' which deal with checking for and altering model table names to prevent clashes. Additionally, '_check_unique_together' and '_check_indexes' are relevant for understanding how Django ensures the uniqueness of models and their assignments to tables. This information should help in diagnosing and potentially resolving the table name conflict issue.",
