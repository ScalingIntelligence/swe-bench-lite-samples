The search results provided include several code spans from `django/db/models/base.py`, which are relevant to understanding how Django handles model creation and validation. Specifically, the error message mentions 'models.E028', which is related to the '_check_column_name_clashes' method within the 'Model' class in the provided code. This method checks for clashes in column names among fields of a model, which is precisely the issue the user is facing. Therefore, the code span with id 'Model._check_column_name_clashes' is directly relevant to the reported issue, as it deals with the validation of column names across fields within a model.

We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names. \nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n"
