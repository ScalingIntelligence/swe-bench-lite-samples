In django/db/models/base.py, the span 'Model._check_column_name_clashes' is relevant because it checks for column name clashes in models, which is a related but not direct fit for the issue. \n\n2. In django/db/models/fields/related.py, the span 'ManyToManyField._check_table_uniqueness' directly checks the uniqueness of table names, which is highly relevant to the issue. This function ensures that there are no duplicate table names in the database. \n\n3. The 'Options.contribute_to_class' method in django/db/models/options.py is crucial as it contributes options to the model class, including the database table name, making it highly relevant. \n\n4. Methods like 'alter_db_table' in django/db/backends/base/schema.py and django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py are significant because they handle the alteration of database table names, which is directly related to the issue.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, focusing on code spans that deal with model definitions, table name settings, and database schema alterations seems appropriate.

The `ManyToManyField` class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` includes the `_check_table_uniqueness` method, which is responsible for validating that the underlying table for a ManyToMany relationship does not clash with existing tables in the database. This method is significant as it directly relates to the issue raised concerning table name clashes across different models in different apps. Additionally, the `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` is also relevant as it manages various metadata options for a model, including the database table name. The inclusion of these classes and methods in the file context suggests that the necessary components for addressing the issue are potentially present.

We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names. \nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n"
