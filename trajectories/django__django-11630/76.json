This error arose after upgrading to Django 2.2, indicating a potential change in Django's handling of model table names across different databases or apps. The provided search results include relevant sections from Django's codebase that manage model instantiation, database schema editing, connection routing, and app configuration, all of which might influence how table names are handled or enforced. Notably, the `Model._check_column_name_clashes` method in `django/db/models/base.py` specifically checks for clashes in column names, which could be adapted to also check for clashes in table names among different models. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_db_table` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` is also pertinent as it deals with altering table names, suggesting it could be involved in the enforcement of unique table names across different models. Given the specificity of the error message ('table_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.'), it's likely that Django 2.2 introduces stricter checks for such naming conflicts, possibly within the model instantiation or schema editing processes.",
