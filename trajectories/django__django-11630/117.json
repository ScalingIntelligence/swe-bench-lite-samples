The search results provided include code spans from various Django modules that handle model state, table introspection, and index management. There are several key areas that might be relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. `StateApps` class in `django/db/migrations/state.py` - This class handles the state of apps and models during migrations, which is crucial for understanding how Django tracks and manages different models and their corresponding tables across different apps.\n\n2. `BaseDatabaseIntrospection` class in `django/db/backends/base/introspection.py` - This class provides methods for introspecting the database, including retrieving table names and installed models. Understanding how Django identifies and processes table names could be essential for resolving conflicts related to duplicate table names across different models and apps.\n\n3. `Index` class in `django/db/models/indexes.py` - Although not directly related to the issue of duplicate table names, understanding how Django handles indexes could provide insight into how table names are managed in relation to database operations.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, the most relevant code spans are those in `django/db/migrations/state.py` and `django/db/backends/base/introspection.py`, as they directly involve the management and introspection of model states and database tables.",

This could be related to changes in how Django handles model registration and introspection to ensure better consistency and potential conflicts with model references. Reviewing the code, we see spans that deal with model registration, introspection, and state management in migrations. The relevant code spans are in `django/db/migrations/state.py` and `django/db/backends/base/introspection.py`, which handle the state of models during migrations and introspecting the database tables, respectively. These spans include methods for adding and removing models from state, reloading models in state, and getting lists of tables from the database.
