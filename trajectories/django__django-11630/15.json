This suggests a change in behavior related to how Django handles model definitions and their corresponding database tables. The search results include relevant sections from Django's `base.py`, `state.py`, and `models.py` modules, which are crucial for understanding how Django models and their tables are managed. The `Model` class in `base.py` contains methods for initializing and validating models, while `ModelState` in `state.py` is used for representing model states during migrations. The `CreateModel` and `AlterModelTable` operations in `models.py` are specifically related to creating and altering models, which can affect table names. This context suggests that these sections are relevant to addressing the issue because they deal with model and table management, as well as migration operations that could lead to conflicts when table names are not uniquely defined across different apps and models.",
