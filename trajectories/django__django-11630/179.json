This issue arises after upgrading to Django 2.2, which enforces stricter rules about table name uniqueness across models. The relevant code spans from the search results are identified as closely related to model initialization, table name uniqueness checks, and schema management. These spans include the Model class and its methods for column name clashes and model name DB lookup clashes, which directly address the uniqueness of table names. Additionally, the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class and its methods for altering database tables, which could potentially be used to address the issue by renaming tables to ensure uniqueness, are also identified as relevant. The RenameModel and AlterModelTable operations in the migrations module further support the possibility of handling the reported issue by renaming models or altering model tables to avoid clashes.

The subsequent attempt to remove the `table_name` attribute and rely on the `schema_editor.alter_db_table` method to manage table name changes resolved the lint errors but the lint errors were still present. Upon reviewing the `RenameModel.database_forwards` and `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_db_table` methods, it becomes clear that the table name management is already handled within the `alter_db_table` method.
