The error message indicates that the `db_table` 'table_name' is used by multiple models, specifically `base.ModelName` and `app2.ModelName`. The context suggests that this setup was previously working but issues arose after upgrading to Django 2.2. The search results include relevant code spans from `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, `django/apps/config.py`, and `django/db/utils.py`. These files cover aspects such as the database schema editor, migration autodetector, app configuration, and database utility functions, all of which are pertinent to the issue at hand. Specifically, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_db_table` method in `schema.py` is directly related to altering table names, which is a potential solution to the issue. Additionally, the `MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_db_table` method in `autodetector.py` is responsible for generating operations related to altering database tables, indicating that migrations could be a way to resolve the naming conflict. The `AppConfig.get_model` method in `config.py` is also relevant as it deals with model lookups within apps, and understanding how Django handles models within different apps could provide insights into the issue. Lastly, `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate` in `utils.py` is related to route database operations, which could influence how migrations and table creations are handled. All these code spans collectively provide a comprehensive view of the areas involved in handling and potentially resolving the issue of table name conflicts across multiple apps and databases.",

The error message indicates that the 'db_table' 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName. This setup worked before upgrading to Django 2.2 but started causing issues after the upgrade. The search results provided include relevant code spans from 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py', 'django/apps/config.py', and 'django/db/utils.py'. These files contain critical methods and classes related to database schema management, migration autodetection, app configuration, and database utility functionalities. The identified spans include 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_db_table' which alters the database table, 'MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_db_table' which generates migrations on altering database tables, 'AppConfig.get_model' which retrieves a model from the app configuration, and 'ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate' which determines if a migration operation is allowed on a database. These spans are directly relevant to the handling of table names and migrations in Django, addressing the core of the reported issue. Therefore, these spans should be included in the identified spans response to address the issue comprehensively.",

The MigrationAutodetector class also specifically addresses changes in table names, which is crucial for detecting and resolving conflicts as mentioned in the reported issue. The AppConfig class manages Django app configurations, including retrieving models, suggesting it would include checks for unique table names, although the provided context doesn't show an explicit constraint enforcement. The ConnectionRouter class, handling database operations routing, could influence how migrations are managed in contexts with potential table name conflicts.
