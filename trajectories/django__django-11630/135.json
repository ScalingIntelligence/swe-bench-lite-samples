Django 2.2 seems to have introduced stricter checks for this scenario, leading to errors in setups that worked fine before the upgrade. The goal is to pinpoint the exact changes in Django's model and database handling that triggered this error after the upgrade. We'll search through the Django codebase, focusing on files related to model and database operations, especially those implementing checks for table uniqueness and model interactions with databases.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about Django throwing an error when different apps with different models have the same table name. This error is described as 'models.E028'. The search results provide several relevant code spans across multiple files in the Django codebase. The key areas of relevance are:\n\n1. **django/db/migrations/autodetector.py** - This file contains the `MigrationAutodetector` class which is responsible for detecting changes in models and generating migrations. The method `generate_altered_db_table` specifically checks for changes in the `db_table` option of models and generates operations to alter the table name if necessary. This method directly relates to the concern of handling identical table names across different models.\n\n2. **django/db/models/base.py** - The `Model` class and its method `_check_column_name_clashes` are relevant. The `Model` class is the base class for all Django models where each instance corresponds to a table in the database. The `_check_column_name_clashes` method checks for column name clashes in a model, which indirectly relates to the issue of table name conflicts but focuses more on column-level conflicts.\n\n3. **django/db/backends/base/schema.py** - The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class and its method `alter_db_table` are relevant. This class handles the schema manipulation operations on the database. The `alter_db_table` method allows changing the name of a database table. This is directly related to the error since changing a table name is one way to resolve the conflict.\n\n4. **django/core/checks/model_checks.py** - The `check_all_models` function is relevant as it checks all models for various issues including the specific error 'models.E028' which indicates that a `db_table` name is used by multiple models. This function collects errors and can be used to identify or prevent the error.\n\nCombining these findings, the relevant code spans are from `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, and `django/apps/config.py`, which involve model definitions, migration auto-detection, database schema editing, and app configuration, all of which are crucial in handling the issue of table name conflicts across different apps and models.",

Specifically, the `check_all_models` function in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` contains the logic that enforces unique table names across different models. This aligns with the error message and the explanation provided in the issue description. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` and the `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` handle modifications and migrations related to table names, which could be relevant in understanding how this change in behavior might have been introduced in Django 2.2. The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` also contains methods that are fundamental to understanding model table name handling. Given this context, I believe I have identified the relevant code necessary to complete the task.",
