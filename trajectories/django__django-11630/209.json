This was not an issue in Django 2.0. Given the complexity and the centrality of database handling in Django, multiple files and functions are likely involved. Focus should be on the model definition, database schema editing, migration operations, and the backend introspection to understand how table name clashes are detected and handled.",

Given the constraints, we need to focus on the changes within the provided file context. So far, the initial change in django/db/models/base.py ensures that the db_table attribute is unique by prefixing it with the app label and model name, which should address the issue of table name clashes. As there are no more files within the context that directly relate to the models and their table names, I suggest we consider the changes implemented as sufficient to resolve the reported issue.",

We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names. \nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n"
