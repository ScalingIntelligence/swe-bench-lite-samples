This issue has emerged post-upgrade to Django 2.2 and was not present in earlier versions like Django 2.0. The search results focus on Django's internal handling of models and related fields, particularly around initialization, checks for column name clashes, and the definition of relational fields such as ForeignKey and ManyToManyField. These code spans provide valuable insight into how Django defines and manages these fields, including how it might handle the assignment and checking of 'db_table'. For instance, the 'Model._check_column_name_clashes' method in 'django/db/models/base.py' directly addresses the collision of db_table names, indicating a direct hit for the reported issue. Additionally, 'ManyToManyField._check_table_uniqueness' in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' may contribute to ensuring uniqueness but is more focused on many-to-many relationships via intermediary tables. The 'MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_db_table' function in 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' also plays a role in handling changes to table names during migrations, which could be relevant to understanding how Django manages and enforces table name uniqueness across different apps and databases. These code spans are directly related to the reported issue of multiple models sharing the same table name, providing a clear lead on where to investigate further to address the issue or understand Django's behavior.",

We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names. \nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n"
