The key elements in the reported issue are the table name collision and the handling of this situation in different Django versions. The search results include relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' that handle the renaming of database tables if the table names change between model states. The method 'generate_altered_db_table' in the MigrationAutodetector class is particularly relevant as it checks and adds an operation to alter the model's table if the name differs from the old model state to the new model state. This aligns with resolving conflicts in table names across different apps, addressing the core issue reported.",
