This conflict is causing errors after upgrading to Django 2.2.

The sections 'Model._check_m2m_through_same_relationship', 'Model._check_column_name_clashes', and 'Model._check_local_fields' are particularly relevant as they deal with checks that ensure database integrity, which would include preventing multiple models from using the same table name. Additionally, 'ManyToManyField._check_table_uniqueness' in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' is essential as it ensures that many-to-many fields' intermediary tables do not clash.

This behavior was not present in Django 2.0. The key elements to identify in the code are the handling of table names in models and how these are checked for uniqueness across different apps and models.\n\nFrom the provided file context, the relevant sections appear to be within 'django/db/models/base.py', specifically the '_check_column_name_clashes' method which checks for clashes in column names, and 'django/db/models/fields/related.py', particularly the 'ManyToManyField' class which deals with many-to-many relationships and might handle some aspects of table name uniqueness in the context of such relations.\n\nNow, examining the new search results:\n\n1. 'django/db/models/base.py' - This file contains the '_check_column_name_clashes' method, which is already identified as relevant. No new insights here.\n\n2. 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' - The 'generate_altered_db_table' method is related to detecting changes in table names during migrations, which could be relevant to the issue.\n\n3. 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' - The 'ManyToManyField' class and its methods, including '__init__', 'check', '_check_unique', '_check_ignored_options', '_check_relationship_model', and '_check_table_uniqueness', are particularly relevant as they deal with the configuration and validation of many-to-many fields, which also involves handling table names and ensuring their uniqueness.\n\nConsidering the issue at hand and the code analysis, the relevant parts of the codebase primarily revolve around how Django handles table names for models and ensures their uniqueness, especially across different apps and during the migration process. This involves looking at both the model definition aspects (in 'base.py') and the field-specific configurations and checks (in 'related.py'), as well as the migration detection logic (in 'autodetector.py').",

Similarly, the ManyToManyField class in django.db.models.fields.related has a method _check_table_uniqueness which would be crucial in detecting and resolving table name clashes, especially for many-to-many relationships. Further, the generate_altered_db_table method in django.db.migrations.autodetector is relevant as it changes the db table if the table name has changed, which would directly impact how Django handles table uniqueness during upgrades and with multiple databases.
