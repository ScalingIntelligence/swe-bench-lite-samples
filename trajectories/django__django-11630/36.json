Django's behavior from version 2.2 onwards strictly enforces uniqueness of db_table names across models, which is a change from earlier versions. To resolve or mitigate this issue, one approach could involve manually adjusting the db_table attribute in the models to ensure uniqueness. The relevant code spans identified in the search results are primarily in 'django/db/models/base.py' which contains methods like '_check_unique_together' and '_check_m2m_through_same_relationship' that might be involved in enforcing these checks. Additionally, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' contains the 'AlterModelTable' operation which could be used to manually alter table names in migrations if automigrations fail due to name conflicts. These sections of code are crucial as they handle model constraints and migration operations related to table names, which are directly relevant to the reported issue.",

The '_check_m2m_through_same_relationship' and '_check_unique_together' methods indicate that Django performs checks on table names and uniqueness, which relates to the reported issue about enforcing unique table names across different models. Additionally, the 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' file context shows operations like 'CreateModel', 'RenameModel', and 'AlterModelTable', which are relevant when considering how migrations are handled with table names during development and deployment. These operations could be responsible for the stricter checks introduced in Django 2.2, affecting the uniqueness of db_table names. Based on this analysis, it appears that the file context is complete in terms of identifying where and how table name uniqueness is being enforced and managed in Django, implying that the relevant code for addressing the reported issue has been found.",
