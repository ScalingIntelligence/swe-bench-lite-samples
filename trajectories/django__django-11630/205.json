The error message specifically points to the 'table_name' being used by multiple models in different apps. This suggests that the database table name uniqueness validation might have been added or strengthened in Django 2.2. To address this, we need to search for the specific code sections related to model and table name validation in Django's source code.",

            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it is clear that the problem centers around Django's enforcement of unique table names across different apps and models in Django 2.2 compared to previous versions. The error message indicates that Django is detecting multiple models using the same table name, which it disallows. This behavior seems to have changed from previous versions of Django, leading to the observed error.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant code spans within Django's core models and migration operations that deal with model and table name uniqueness checks, alterations, and constraints. These include checks for unique together fields, indexes, constraints, and model table clashes. The `_check_field_name_clashes` and `_check_column_name_clashes` methods in the Model class are particularly relevant, as they check for clashes in field names and column names respectively. Additionally, the `check_all_models` function in `model_checks.py` is responsible for ensuring that database table names are unique across models. This function extends the model checks to include these uniqueness validations.\n\nFurthermore, the `AlterModelTable` and `RenameModel` classes in `migrations/operations/models.py` are relevant as they handle changes to model table names during migrations, which is a potential remediation step for resolving the reported issue by ensuring each model has a unique table name in the database. The `_check_model_name_db_lookup_clashes` method is also significant, as it checks for model name clashes that could potentially affect database lookup operations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue concerning unique table names across different models within Django applications. These spans cover critical areas such as model clash checks, index and constraint uniqueness, and migration operations for altering model tables, which are directly related to the issue at hand. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete with the identification of these relevant code spans.",

  "initial_message": "Django throws error when different apps with different models have the same name table name.\nDescription\n\t\nError message:\ntable_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.\nWe have a Base app that points to a central database and that has its own tables. We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names. \nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n"
