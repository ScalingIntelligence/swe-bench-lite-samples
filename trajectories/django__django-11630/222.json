This issue becomes apparent after upgrading to Django 2.2. The search results focus on the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py`, which is central to Django's model handling. Specifically, the code spans involving `Model.__init__` and `Model._check_column_name_clashes` are highly relevant. The `__init__` method is responsible for initializing model instances and handling field assignments, while `_check_column_name_clashes` method checks for and reports clashes in column names across fields in a model. These methods are crucial for understanding how Django handles model field assignments and column name conflicts. Therefore, they provide a solid basis for diagnosing and potentially resolving the reported issue of table name clashes across different models in different apps.",

This issue is exacerbated after upgrading to Django 2.2 and seems to be a new behavior not encountered in older versions such as Django 2.0. The error message specifically points out that the db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models. This suggests a check or constraint in Django versions 2.2+ that ensures table names are unique across different models. The search results provide insights into the mechanisms Django uses to manage and check table names. For instance, the '_check_column_name_clashes' method in the 'Model' class checks for column name clashes, hinting that similar checks might be in place for table names. The 'AppConfig' and 'Apps' classes are pivotal in managing application configurations and models, which are relevant for understanding how Django handles multiple apps and their corresponding models. The 'AppConfig' class, particularly its methods 'get_model' and 'get_models', and the 'Apps' class with its 'get_models' and 'get_model' methods, manage the retrieval of models. Therefore, these code spans are relevant to understanding how Django handles models and their uniqueness across apps. Synthesizing this information, the identified code spans will sufficiently address the reported issue regarding the limitations of having same table names across different models in different apps in Django 2.2+.",

  "initial_message": "Django throws error when different apps with different models have the same name table name.\nDescription\n\t\nError message:\ntable_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.\nWe have a Base app that points to a central database and that has its own tables. We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names. \nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n"
