To resolve this, we need to identify where the option parsing logic exists and how unrecognized options are currently handled. The primary files to focus on are the ones dealing with option parsing and handling exceptions related to unrecognized options. The provided file context includes relevant code from the 'pylint/config/config_initialization.py', 'pylint/config/exceptions.py', 'pylint/lint/run.py', and 'pylint/lint/base_options.py', which are all crucial for understanding how options are parsed and how errors are handled. Specifically, the '_UnrecognizedOptionError' class in 'pylint/config/exceptions.py' is directly related to the issue. Additionally, the '_config_initialization' function in 'pylint/config/config_initialization.py' appears to be the place where unrecognized options are detected and raise the '_UnrecognizedOptionError'. Given this context, it seems likely that modifying the way this exception is handled in the '__init__' method of the 'Run' class in 'pylint/lint/run.py' would resolve the issue.",

The option parsing logic in `pylint/config/config_initialization.py` is configured to handle unrecognized options by raising `_UnrecognizedOptionError` (found in `pylint/config/exceptions.py`). This exception is further processed to add a message indicating the unrecognized option.\n\n2. The linter's initialization and command-line argument handling are detailed in `pylint/lint/run.py`, which sets up the environment and processes arguments before the linting task begins.\n\n3. The ability to handle different reporting formats and configure linter behavior through various options is well-documented in `pylint/lint/base_options.py`.\n\nThis context suggests that the necessary components for addressing the unrecognized option issue are at least partly identified: the key exception handling is in place within `config_initialization.py`, and the overall mechanism for managing command-line arguments is set up through the combination of `config_initialization.py` and `run.py`. This indicates that modifications or enhancements to the user-friendly handling of unrecognized options might best be focused in these specific areas of the code.\n\nHowever, it's noted that while the recognition of an unrecognized option and the emission of an error message are covered, the specification specifically looking for a more user-friendly ending like the example from mypy (`usage: mypy [-h] [-v] [-V] [more options; see below] mypy: error: unrecognized arguments: -Q`) is not explicitly implemented in the context provided.
