The reference points to Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, suggesting that the code in this module likely needs to be updated. To address this, we should focus our search on the `deletion.py` module and inspect the code around the given line numbers for the delete function and related logic. Additionally, it would be wise to check the `base.py` module, specifically the Model class, for any related logic in the delete method.",
