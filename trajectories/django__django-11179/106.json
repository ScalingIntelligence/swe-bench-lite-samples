The issue specifically mentions Django.db.models.deletion, lines 276-281, indicating that the problem might be related to how the deletion is handled, particularly with respect to the primary key update. After analyzing the provided code spans, I've identified two key areas that need attention:\n\n1. The `Model.delete()` method in `django/db/models/base.py` where the actual deletion occurs, but it does not address the resetting of the primary key.\n2. The `Collector.delete()` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, which orchestrates the deletion of the instances but also does not explicitly handle the resetting of the PKs after deletion.\n\nTo resolve the issue, modifications are needed in the `Collector.delete()` method to ensure that after deleting instances of a model, the primary key is set to `None` if there are no dependencies. This involves extending the method to iterate through the deleted instances and reset their primary keys when appropriate.",
