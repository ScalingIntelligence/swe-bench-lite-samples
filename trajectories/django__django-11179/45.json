The search results provide two relevant files: 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'base.py', the span labeled 'Model.delete' shows the implementation of the delete method, which confirms it uses a Collector to handle the deletion process. This aligns with the issue context as it suggests inspecting deletion logic. In 'deletion.py', the span labeled 'Collector.delete' contains the core deletion logic, showing how instances are collected and deleted. This is highly relevant as it directly addresses the deletion mechanism and where the PK update should be implemented. Notably, the current delete method does not explicitly set the PK to None after deletion, thus validating the need for the reported issue.
