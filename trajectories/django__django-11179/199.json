This is a Django framework issue related to the deletion handling in the django/db/models/deletion.py module. The search results primarily consist of various functions and classes related to model deletion behaviors, including CASCADE, PROTECT, SET_NULL, and DO_NOTHING strategies. The Collector class appears to be central to the deletion process, managing how objects are collected for deletion and how field updates are handled. Notably, the .delete() method within the Collector class does not explicitly set the primary keys of the deleted instances to None. This aligns with the reported issue that the PKs are not updated after deletion. Considering the context, the relevant code spans include the entire Collector class as it is responsible for orchestrating model deletions, including the .delete() method which needs to be updated to address the issue.",
