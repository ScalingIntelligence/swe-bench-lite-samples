Specifically, it states that the Primary Key (PK) is not being set to None after the delete() method is called, which is the desired behavior. To address this, we need to identify where the delete operation is handled and ensure that the PK is set to None afterward.\n\nWe have identified three main files that might be relevant to this issue: 'django/db/models/base.py', 'django/db/models/deletion.py', and 'django/db/models/query.py'. \n\nIn 'django/db/models/base.py', the Model class contains the delete() method, which is responsible for initiating the deletion process. However, it delegates most of the actual deletion logic to the Collector class defined in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the Collector class's delete() method is where the actual deletion of model instances happens. It iterates through the instances to be deleted, sends pre_delete and post_delete signals, and then performs the actual deletion operation. The code responsible for setting the PK to None is found at the end of the delete() method in the Collector class, specifically in the section where it iterates over the deleted instances and sets the PK to None.\n\nFinally, 'django/db/models/query.py' contains the delete() method for the QuerySet class, but the implementation is more of a wrapper around the Collector class, so the detailed behavior is similar to what's found in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant spans are located primarily in the 'django/db/models/deletion.py' file, since this is where the actual deletion logic resides, including the setting of PKs to None.",
