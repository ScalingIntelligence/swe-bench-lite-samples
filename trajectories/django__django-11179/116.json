This is a critical behavior in database management systems to ensure data integrity and consistency. The issue mentions specific lines in the `django.db.models.deletion` module where the necessary changes should be made. After analyzing the provided code spans, it's clear that the `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py` is responsible for the deletion logic and could be the place to update to ensure the PK is set to None after deletion. The `Model.delete` method in `django/db/models/base.py` initializes the deletion process by creating a `Collector` object and calling its `delete` method. This process ensures that related objects are also deleted as needed. There's a clear alignment between the issue description and the behavior in the `Collector.delete` method, which iterates through models and instances to perform deletions and should be updated to set the PK to None after deletion.",
