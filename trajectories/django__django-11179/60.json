The provided search results include a section of code from django/db/models/deletion.py, specifically the delete() method in the Collector class. Initially, I noticed that the PK is set to None at the end of the delete() method for each instance in the self.data dictionary. However, upon further inspection, I see that this setting of PK to None is actually a fallback mechanism after the deletion process. The primary deletion logic (where the PK should ideally be set to None) appears to reside within the bulk deletion process using sql.DeleteQuery. Since the issue specifies the need to update the model's PK after a delete call, particularly for models without dependencies, it seems like the relevant area to focus on is within the bulk deletion section where the PK of each instance could be set to None immediately after deletion. Despite the initial impression from the code snippet, it becomes clear upon closer examination that the current implementation does not directly address the issue. Therefore, the relevant code span would be the part within the bulk deletion process where the PKs of deleted instances should be set to None.",
