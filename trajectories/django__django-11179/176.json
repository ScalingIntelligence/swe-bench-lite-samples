This behavior should be consistent in Django's model deletion process to avoid any dangling references. Based on the file context, we need to focus on `django/db/models/base.py` where the `Model` class is defined, particularly the `delete` method. Additionally, `django/db/models/deletion.py` contains the `Collector` class which is responsible for collecting and deleting objects, potentially where the change needs to be made. Finally, `django/db/models/query.py` defines the `QuerySet` class, which also has a `delete` method that may need to be considered.",

In the provided search results, I identified relevant code spans primarily from the `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py` files. This includes the `Model.delete` method in `base.py` and the `Collector.delete` method in `deletion.py`. Both methods seem crucial as they outline the deletion process and the state of the deleted object. Furthermore, the `Collector.delete` method contains logic that could potentially be modified to address the issue by ensuring that primary keys are set to None after deletion. Therefore, I conclude that these code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",
