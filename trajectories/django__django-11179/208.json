It is mentioned that primary keys (PKs) should be set to None after calling delete(). The issue also mentions a specific location in the Django source code (django/db/models/deletion:276-281) that likely needs updating to address this problem. Based on this information, two search parameters can be used: (1) a direct code snippet search in the mentioned file and lines to pinpoint the exact location, and (2) a broader search for the delete() method in Django's model-related files to ensure all relevant instances are considered.",
