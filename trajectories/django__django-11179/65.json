This change is needed to update the model line 280 in Django's deletion logic. The search results provided contain relevant code snippets from Django's models and deletion modules. Specifically, the 'Model.delete' and 'Collector.delete' methods are where the deletion logic is implemented in Django. The 'Model.delete' function currently ensures that the model instance has a PK before it attempts to delete it. The 'Collector.delete' function is responsible for managing the deletion of objects and their dependencies, and it does not currently set the PK to None after deleting an instance. To address the issue, modifications would need to be made to these functions to ensure that after deleting an instance, the PK is set to None.",
