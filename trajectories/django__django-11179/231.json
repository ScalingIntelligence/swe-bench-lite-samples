The search results include relevant code spans from the `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py` files. In `base.py`, the `delete()` method of the `Model` class is found, which is responsible for deleting model instances.

In `deletion.py`, the `delete()` method of the `Collector` class is found, which handles the actual deletion of collected instances.
