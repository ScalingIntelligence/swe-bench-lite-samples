This needs to be addressed in the `delete()` method of the `Model` class. The current implementation of `delete()` in the `Model` class collects the objects to be deleted and delegates the actual deletion to the `Collector`. The `Collector` class's `delete()` method currently does not set the PK to None after deletion. We need to identify the relevant part in the `Collector` class to modify this behavior. The `Collector` class has a method `delete()` that performs the actual deletion and it appears to be the appropriate place to set the PK to None after deletion. The analysis of the search results shows that the code spans related to `Model.delete` and `Collector.delete` are relevant to the reported issue. The `Model.delete` method is where the deletion process is initiated, and the `Collector.delete` method is where the actual deletion happens and where the PK should be set to None after deletion.",
