After analyzing the provided search results, it appears that the relevant code spans are located within the django/db/models/deletion.py file, specifically within the Collector class's delete method (span_id 'Collector.delete'). This method contains the logic for batch deletion and includes setting the primary key to None after deletion. Additionally, within the django/db/models/base.py file, the Model class's delete method (span_id 'Model.delete') calls the Collector to handle the deletion, which further confirms the relevance of the aforementioned code span.
