From the search results, the relevant part of the code is in the `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. This method handles the actual deletion process and should update the primary key to None after deletion. The provided code span does indeed reflect this logic, where after deleting the instances, the primary key of each instance is set to None in the line `setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)`. This directly addresses the reported issue.\n\nAdditionally, there's a confirmation that the `delete` method in the `Model` class of `django/db/models/base.py` calls the `Collector.collect` method and then `return collector.delete()`, ensuring that the entire deletion process is managed and the PK clearing function is executed, aligning with the requirement.\n\nSince the code spans provided cover the necessary functionality for setting PKs to None after delete and managing the deletion process, the search task can be considered complete.",
