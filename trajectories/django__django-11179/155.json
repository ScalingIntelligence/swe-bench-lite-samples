Currently, this update is not happening, and the issue is specifically mentioned to be around Django.db.models.deletion:276-281. To address this, I need to focus on the delete() method within the Django model classes and ensure that the primary key is set to None after deletion. Additionally, I should check the deletion logic in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file for any operations that might affect primary key updates. Given the context, I will first look for the delete() method in models and then investigate the specific lines in the `deletion.py` file.",

The issue specifies that after calling delete() on a model instance, the primary key (PK) should be set to None, which is not currently happening. The code in django/db/models/base.py for the Model.delete method does not currently set the primary key to None after deletion. Similarly, the code in django/db/models/deletion.py, specifically in the Collector.delete method, does not address setting primary keys to None either. These two sections of code are therefore the most relevant to address the reported issue, as they directly handle model instance deletion and would be the appropriate places to implement the required functionality to update the PKs after deletion.",
