The issue mentions Django.db.models.deletion specifically around lines 276-281, which suggests that this part of the code should be updated to set the PKs to None after a .delete() call. Upon examining the provided search results, I found a relevant code span in the django/db/models/deletion.py file within the Collector class's delete method. This method handles the deletion of instances and includes a loop iterating over instances in the self.data dictionary. The last part of this method, after the post_delete signals are sent, is where the primary keys of the deleted instances are set to None. This part of the code directly addresses the issue reported and should be considered relevant.",
