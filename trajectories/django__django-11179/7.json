The issue navigates to a specific section in django/db/models/deletion.py, lines 276-281, which suggests looking into the delete logic within that module. Additionally, there are references to model and deletion related classes and functions across several files, indicating a need to focus on the model deletion process. Given the references, the search should primarily focus on the model deletion logic within the files related to models, deletion handling, and databases.",

The file context provided includes the relevant parts of 'django/db/models/deletion.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'. Specifically, the 'delete' method in 'Model' class uses a 'Collector' instance to handle deletion, which is defined in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. The 'Collector' class contains a 'delete' method that currently handles deletion logic, including sending pre_delete and post_delete signals, updating fields, and performing the actual deletion in batches. However, it does not explicitly set the PK to None after deletion. This behavior aligns with the issue reported, indicating that the provided file context does contain the relevant code where modifications are likely to be made.
