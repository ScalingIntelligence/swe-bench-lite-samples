Given the context provided, it is likely that the 'delete' method in the `Model` class in '_base.py' or the 'delete' method in the 'Collector' class in 'deletion.py' should be reviewed. Additionally, the 'ForeignKey' class in 'related.py' might handle dependency checks, which could be related. We can initiate a search on these classes and methods to find relevant code.",

To address this, I looked into the 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py' files. In 'base.py', the 'Model.delete()' method is responsible for deleting instances of models, and it uses a 'Collector' object. The 'Collector' class in 'deletion.py' collects instances to be deleted and handles the actual deletion process. The main logic for deletion is found in the 'delete()' method of the 'Collector' class. It sorts the instances to be deleted, handles pre and post deletion signals, and performs the actual deletion. However, the current implementation of 'Collector.delete()' does not explicitly set the PK to None after deletion. From the context provided and the code examined, the line number 280 mentioned in the issue corresponds to the setting of the PK to None. Thus, the relevant code spans involve the 'Model.delete()' method in 'base.py' and the 'delete()' method in 'Collector' in 'deletion.py'.",
