In 'django/db/models/base.py', the Model class's delete method is found, which is directly related to the reported issue. This method delegates the deletion process to a Collector instance but does not currently handle the setting of PKs to None after deletion. Similarly, in 'django/db/models/query.py', the QuerySet class's delete method is also relevant as it involves bulk deletions and uses a Collector to perform the deletions. Given the context and the specific issue, these code spans are the primary focus for addressing the requirement to set PKs to None upon deletion of model instances without dependencies.",

Upon reviewing the provided search results, the relevant file is 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. Within this file, the 'Collector' class contains methods that handle the deletion process. The 'Collector.delete' method at the end of the file is the most relevant as it orchestrates the actual deletion of objects and could be modified to also handle setting the PKs to None after deletion. This method should be updated similarly to how the field updates are handled within the same method to ensure that the PKs are set to None for models without dependencies after their deletion.",
