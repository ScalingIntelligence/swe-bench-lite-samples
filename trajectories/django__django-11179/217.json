The primary key (PK) should be set to None after a `delete()` call. The relevant file is likely `django/db/models/base.py`, and potential areas to focus on are the `delete()` method and its interactions with the model's primary key. Additionally, the model's `_get_pk_val` method might be relevant as it deals with getting the primary key value, which might need to be updated to handle the PK being set to None after deletion.",

The search results provided include several code spans from django/db/models/base.py, which is relevant to the issue since it contains the Model class definition and its methods. The key spans to focus on are those related to the delete() method and the primary key (pk) handling. Specifically, I identified the following spans as relevant: 'Model.delete', 'Model._get_pk_val', and 'Model._set_pk_val'. These spans are directly related to the deletion process and the management of the primary key, which aligns with the reported issue. However, the current implementation in the 'Model.delete' does not include setting the PK to None, which suggests this area needs modification to address the issue.",
