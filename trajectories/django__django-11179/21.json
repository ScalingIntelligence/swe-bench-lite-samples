However, the actual update to the model during deletion is handled in the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py. Here, the Collector's collect method collect dependencies of the objects to be deleted and then handles the deletion. The exact location of the update to set the PK fields to None post-deletion would likely be specific to the Collector's delete method signature, which isn't provided in the search results. Given the endpoint mentioned (Django.db.models.deletion:276-281), which is not included in the provided snippets, there might be additional code relevant to the issue that wasn't included, yet that would probably handle or influence the behavior post-deletion, influencing the PK clearing logic critically.",
