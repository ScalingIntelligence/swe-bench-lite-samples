            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves the behavior of the delete() method in Django models when no dependencies are present. The Primary Key (PK) should be set to None after a delete() call, but this functionality is apparently missing. The issue suggests that the modification should be made in the Django.db.models.deletion module around lines 276-281. Focusing on these lines and possibly the surrounding code is likely to yield the exact part of the codebase that handles the delete() method. From the context provided, it's clear that the deletion logic might be in the 'delete' method of the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py. Additionally, it's also important to check the 'delete' method in the QuerySet class within django/db/models/query.py, which manages the deletion logic at a more general level.",

The issue specifically references Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, implying that the deletion logic might need to be adjusted in this section. In the search results, there are two files of interest: django/db/models/deletion.py and django/db/models/query.py. These files contain classes and methods related to model deletion. Specifically, the `Collector` class in django/db/models/deletion.py contains methods like `delete()` which is likely where the PK update logic should be placed. Additionally, the `QuerySet` class in django/db/models/query.py contains a `delete()` method that calls into the `Collector` class. The content of both files suggests that the primary focus should be on updating the `Collector.delete()` method to ensure that the PKs are set to None after deletion. This task is not yet complete as the current implementation of `Collector.delete()` does not set the PKs to None after deletion. Instead, it calls `sql.DeleteQuery(model).delete_batch(pk_list, self.using)` and emits `signals.post_delete.send()`. The identified spans of code are relevant but require modification to address the reported issue.",
