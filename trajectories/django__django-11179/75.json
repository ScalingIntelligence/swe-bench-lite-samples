Specifically, it mentions that the primary key (PK) should be set to None after a `.delete()` call on a model with no dependencies. The current context indicates that no relevant code has been identified yet. The search results present a detailed view of the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py`, including the `delete()` method. This method is responsible for deleting an instance of a model. It uses a `Collector` to collect related objects and then calls `collector.delete()` to perform the deletion. However, it does not currently set the PK to None after deletion. This suggests that the relevant code spans are those related to the `delete()` method in the `Model` class, as this is where the logic for handling deletions exists. By analyzing these spans, we can identify the location where the PK should be set to None after deletion, aligning with the reported issue's requirements.",

The issue suggests setting the PK to None after the `.delete()` call. To address this, we need to focus on the `delete()` method and potentially modify it to update the PK after deletion. The relevant code spans are the `delete()` method itself and possibly the `ModelState` class for managing the model's state, including the PK.

In particular, the line 'setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)' is executed for each instance after deletion, which aligns with the required behavior highlighted in the issue. This suggests that despite the initial impression based on the 'Model' class context, the entire deletion process related to changing the PKs is indeed covered in the file context provided. Importantly, this setting of PKs to None is not solely managed within the 'Model' class, rather within the cascading deletion control mechanism actively managed through the 'Collector' class, which tracks and manages all related objects and fields under deletion.
