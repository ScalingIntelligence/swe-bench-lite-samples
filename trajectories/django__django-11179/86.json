The issue mentions Django.db.models.deletion specifically around lines 276-281, suggesting a need to review the 'Collector.delete()' method which is where the deletion process is handled. \n\nFrom the given code spans, the 'django/db/models/deletion.py' file contains the 'Collector.delete()' method implementation, which includes the logic for handling model deletions, including setting primary keys to None in the final lines of method (lines 276-281 in summary). Additionally, 'django/db/models/base.py' file contains the 'Model.delete()' method which orchestrates the deletion including instantiating the collector and calling its delete method. Both these methods and sections of the code are directly relevant to the reported issue of setting PKs to None after model deletion.\n\nThe current search seems sufficient to address the reported issue as it covers the critical parts of the deletion process, including where primary keys should be set to None.
