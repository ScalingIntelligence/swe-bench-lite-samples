This behavior is expected to be updated such that the PK is set to `None` after the `delete()` call if there are no dependencies. The search results provide insights into the relevant sections of the Django codebase that handle model deletion and PK management. Specifically, the `Model.delete()` method in `django/db/models/base.py` and the `Collector.delete()` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py` are crucial for understanding the deletion process. The `Model._get_pk_val()` and `Model._set_pk_val()` methods are also relevant as they deal with getting and setting the PK value. Additionally, the `ForeignKey` and `ForeignObject` classes in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` are examined for any dependencies that might affect the deletion and PK clearing process. The analysis indicates that the current implementation of `Collector.delete()` does not explicitly set the PK to `None` for the deleted instances, which aligns with the reported issue. Therefore, the identified relevant code spans include the `Model.delete()`, `Collector.delete()`, `Model._get_pk_val()`, and `Model._set_pk_val()` methods, as well as any related sections that might influence this behavior.",
