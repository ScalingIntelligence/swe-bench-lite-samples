            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the `.delete()` method on model instances when there are no dependencies. The specific complaint is that the primary key (PK) is not set to `None` after calling `.delete()`. This issue is directly linked to the code within `django/db/models/deletion.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`.\n\n1. **django/db/models/deletion.py**: This file contains the `Collector` class which is responsible for collecting and deleting instances. The relevant method is `Collector.delete()`. This method implements the logic for deletion including updating field values and sending signals. The key part that handles the deletion is the loop where instances are deleted and the post_delete signals are sent. The issue suggests that after deleting an instance, the PK should be set to `None`, which isn't happening currently. There's a pointer to lines 276-281, which implies that the specific section should be updated to include setting the PK to `None`.\n\n2. **django/db/models/base.py**: This file contains the `Model` class, which includes the `Model.delete()` method. This method is responsible for deleting individual model instances. It uses the `Collector` class to perform the delete operation. Although the method itself does not directly handle setting the PK to `None`, it is the entry point for deleting individual instances and should be updated to ensure that the PK is cleared after deletion. Given the nature of the issue, it's evident that the pertinent code spans are within the `Collector.delete()` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`.\n\nTo address the issue, the `Collector.delete()` method should be modified to ensure that after deleting instances, their PKs are set to `None`. This modification will cover both scenarios where instances are deleted individually through `Model.delete()` and in bulk through `QuerySet.delete()` since both methods rely on the `Collector` class to perform deletions.",

The provided file context includes the relevant delete() method in both django/db/models/deletion.py and django/db/models/base.py. In the django/db/models/deletion.py, the delete method within the Collector class appears to handle the actual deletion process and does not immediately set the PK to None after deletion. However, the indication in the issue about needing to update the model line 280 suggests that this might be where the change should occur to set the PK to None.
