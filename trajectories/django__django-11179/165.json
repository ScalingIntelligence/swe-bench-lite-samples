This should be handled within the `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. Upon analyzing the file, the `Collector.delete` method indeed performs the deletion of objects but does not explicitly set the PKs to `None`. The relevant code spans to address this issue are those that handle the deletion and possibly those that handle the signals post deletion, as those might be places where the PK could be updated.\n\nThe identified code spans are within the `Collector.delete` method where the deletion logic resides. Specifically, the spans that iterate over instances and manage signals before and after deletion are critical. The existing logic does not include setting the PK to `None`, which is the main issue to address. Therefore, these spans need to be modified or supplemented to ensure that PKs are set to `None` after deletion for models without dependencies.",
