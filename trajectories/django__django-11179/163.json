Based on the issue description, the focus is on the behavior of the `delete()` method in the Django ORM, specifically how the PKs are managed post-deletion. \n\nFrom the search results, several code spans in `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py` are potentially relevant. Notably:\n- The `Model.delete()` method (span id='Model.delete') in `django/db/models/base.py` contains the core delete logic for model instances. It is crucial to inspect this code to understand if and how the PK might be reset after deletion.\n- The `Collector.delete()` method (span id='Collector.delete') in `django/db/models/deletion.py` is responsible for managing the deletion of related objects, which might include checks or operations relevant to the PK management.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are targeted for further investigation and potential modification to implement the desired behavior of clearing the PK after a successful delete operation on model instances without dependencies.",
