The primary files of interest are django/db/models/deletion.py and django/db/models/base.py, as these are directly related to model deletion and the base model class implementation. The specific lines mentioned in the issue (276-281) in django/db/models/deletion.py suggest that the logic for handling PK after deletion might be implemented there. Additionally, django/db/models/query.py contains the QuerySet class, which also implements delete() method, making it another relevant file to examine. Other files listed provide context on related functionalities but are less directly related to the specific issue at hand. Given this information, focusing on the delete() method implementation in these files should be sufficient to address the issue.",

Specifically, it mentions that the primary keys (PKs) are not being set to None after a delete operation. This issue is critical for data integrity and consistency in the database.\n\nWithin the search results, multiple files and spans of code are relevant to this issue. Notably, the delete() method in django/db/models/base.py is the starting point for a model's deletion process. It uses a Collector object to perform the deletion, which suggests that any logic for setting the PK to None after deletion would likely be found within the logic of the Collector class or its methods.\n\nAdditionally, the delete() method within the QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py also initiates the deletion process, which aligns with the reported issue, as it affects how models are deleted via querysets. The Collector class's delete() method in django/db/models/deletion.py is the most relevant, as it handles the actual deletion process, including updating fields.\n\nGiven the detailed inspection of the code, the spans involving the delete methods and the Collector class are the most pertinent to the reported issue. These spans address the immediate actions post-deletion, including the setting of PKs to None, which is directly related to fixing the reported issue.",
