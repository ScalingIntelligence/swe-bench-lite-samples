The search results show a relevant section of the Django codebase in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file. Specifically, the `Collector.delete` method is a significant part of this. This method handles the deletion process for models, including sorting, sending signals, and executing the delete queries. The existing code does not explicitly set the primary key to None after deletion. However, it's interesting to note that the code attempts to handle post-delete operations, which could be a place to implement the requirement. Given this, the focus should be on understanding and possibly modifying the last part of the `delete` method to ensure the primary key is set to None for deleted instances, which is currently hinted at but not fully implemented. This understanding is crucial for determining the relevance of this code span to the reported issue.",
