This behavior should be implemented in the delete method of the model. In the provided search results, we have three main files: django/db/models/base.py, django/db/models/deletion.py, and django/db/models/query.py. \n\nThe django/db/models/base.py file contains the Model class definition and its delete method. This is directly relevant as it defines the delete behavior for model instances. The delete method here calls the Collector to handle the deletion process. \n\nThe django/db/models/deletion.py file contains the Collector class, which is responsible for collecting objects to be deleted and handling the deletion process. The delete method in this class does not currently set the PK to None after deletion. This is where the fix should be applied. \n\nThe django/db/models/query.py file contains the QuerySet class, which also includes a delete method. This method calls the Collector to perform the deletion, making it indirectly relevant to the issue as it triggers the deletion process handled by the Collector. \n\nBased on this analysis, the most relevant code span to address the issue is the delete method in the Collector class within django/db/models/deletion.py, as it is responsible for the actual deletion and should be updated to set the PK to None. Other parts of the code involve trigger points for deletion but do not directly handle the logic of setting the PK to None.",
