This suggests an update is needed around the delete() method and its interaction with primary keys. Reviewing the search results, two files are relevant: django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/deletion.py. In django/db/models/base.py, the Model class contains the delete() method implementation which directly relates to the issue. The delete() method calls the Collector to handle the deletion. In django/db/models/deletion.py, the Collector class that handles the actual deletion process is defined, particularly the delete() method within the Collector class. This is where the actual deletion and potential update of primary keys post-deletion should occur. Given the issue description, the relevant code spans are those related to the delete methods and their interactions with primary keys in both files. The code span for Model.delete in django/db/models/base.py is likely relevant for understanding how the delete operation is initiated. The code spans for Collector.delete and the initialization of Collector in django/db/models/deletion.py are crucial as they encapsulate the deletion logic and any operations that should be done after deletion to ensure primary keys are set to None for models without dependencies. Specifically, the update to ensure primary keys are set to None should be implemented in the deletion logic of the Collector class.",
