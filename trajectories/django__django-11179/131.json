Given the complexity of Django's model deletion process, which often involves cascading and managing related models, it might be beneficial to search across Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and the deletion handling mechanism further.

The provided context and search results include several relevant sections of the Django codebase that can be related to this issue. The most relevant sections are found in the Model.delete method and the Collector class within the deletion.py file. The Model.delete method is responsible for the actual deletion of model instances, while the Collector class manages the collection and deletion of related objects. There are a few key sections to focus on: Model.delete, which initiates the deletion process; Collector.delete, which handles the actual deletion and could potentially include the logic to set PKs to None; and potentially the QuerySet.delete method, although it mostly delegates to the Collector. Further analysis of the Collector.delete method reveals that it does not currently set the PK to None after deletion, which aligns with the reported issue that PKs are not being updated after deletion.",
