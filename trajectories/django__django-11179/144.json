Specifically, the issue highlights that when an instance of a model with no dependencies is deleted, the primary key (PK) is not set to None as it should be. The reference to 'Django.db.models.deletion:276-281' suggests a section in the Django code base that may need modification to resolve this issue.\n\nFrom the search results, two main files are relevant: 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. Within these files, the most pertinent code spans are related to the 'delete' method in the Model class and the 'delete' method in the Collector class. These methods directly handle the deletion logic and are the likely candidates for modification to ensure that PKs are set to None upon deletion.\n\nThe 'Model.delete' span in 'django/db/models/base.py' shows the method that initiates the deletion process, while the 'Collector.delete' span in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' contains the actual deletion logic. Notably, the 'delete' method in the Collector class includes a loop that updates attributes and sets PKs to None at the end of the deletion process. This section already contains logic that sets the PK to None, but there is potential for further examination to ensure this logic is triggered as expected when there are no dependencies.",
