This method initiates the deletion process and uses the `Collector` to collect and delete related objects.\n\n2. In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `delete()` method of the `Collector` class is present. This method manages the actual deletion of objects and should be updated to set the PK to None after deletion.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans are in the `deletion.py` file, particularly the `delete()` method of the `Collector` class, as it is responsible for the final deletion and should handle the setting of PK to None.",
