In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.delete` method currently collects and deletes the instance but does not handle the PK setting to None as required by the issue. \n2. In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `Collector.delete` method handles the deletion of objects and sends signals but also lacks the PK update logic.\n\nBased on the issue description, the relevant spans are where the delete logic occurs and where model instances are removed or updated. The specific targets are `Model.delete` and `Collector.delete`. Both spans need modification to implement the PK setting to None after deletion.",
