Specifically, the issue mentions that the primary key (PK) should be set to None after the .delete() call. This requires examining the code related to the .delete() method in the Django source code.\n\nThe search results contain two relevant files: 'django/db/models/deletion.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'. In 'deletion.py', the 'Collector' class's 'delete' method is found, and it includes logic for handling the deletion of model instances. The code does not currently set the PK to None for instances that are deleted if they have no dependencies. Therefore, this is the relevant section for addressing the issue.\n\nIn 'base.py', the 'Model' class's 'delete' method is found, which calls the Collector to handle the deletion. Although this method does not directly address the PK setting, it orchestrates the deletion process, making it relevant context for understanding the flow.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are within the 'Collector.delete' method in 'deletion.py', specifically examining the part of the method responsible for handling deleted instances. There is no direct code yet to set the PK to None for instances deleted without dependencies.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Model.delete' method in 'base.py' provides context but does not directly relate to setting the PK to None. However, any changes to how PKs are handled would likely need to consider this method's interactions with the deletion process.",
