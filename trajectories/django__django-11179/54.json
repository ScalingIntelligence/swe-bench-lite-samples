The issue mentiones Django's db.models.deletion module, specifically lines 276-281, suggesting a need to check and potentially update this part of the code. Given the context, focusing on the 'delete' functionality within the models and deletion modules seems crucial. Also, since PKs are intimately linked with model instances, looking at how PKs are managed upon deletion is essential. Specific targets would be the 'delete()' method across Model classes and QuerySet, as well as related functionalities in 'deletion.py'.",

The reported issue specifically mentioned Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, indicating that the deletion logic in the Collector class should be updated. I found that in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file, the `Collector.delete` method handles the deletion of objects and could be modified to set the PK to None. Currently, it doesn't explicitly set the PK to None after deletion. Relevant spans in the Model class from `django/db/models/base.py` were also analyzed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the delete operation and the management of PKs. The span `Model.delete` contains the delete method itself, which is crucial for understanding how deletion is initiated. The span `Collector.delete` in `django/db/models/deletion.py` is where the actual deletion logic resides and where the update to set PKs to None should be implemented. No other code files or spans seemed directly relevant beyond these, so I have included these critical spans in my response.",

The 'Model' class's 'delete' method uses 'Collector' to handle the deletion process, including sending pre_delete and post_delete signals and performing the actual deletion.
