This requirement suggests modifying the deletion process to ensure that the PK is updated accordingly. The provided search results contain code from two files: `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py`. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.delete` method is identified as a likely location for implementing the necessary changes. The method currently ensures that the instance has a PK before deletion and delegates the deletion process to a `Collector`. However, the PK update logic is not present in this method. In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `Collector.delete` method is found, which manages the actual deletion process. This method iterates over models and instances to perform deletions and might be the appropriate place to include the logic for setting the PK to `None` after deletion. Reviewing these methods suggests that modifications are required in both to address the reported issue fully. I will identify the relevant code spans accordingly.",
