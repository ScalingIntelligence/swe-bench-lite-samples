The issue suggests examining lines 276-281 in `django/db/models/deletion.py` to update the model at line 280. It appears that the primary focus should be on the `delete()` method within models and how it interacts with primary keys upon deletion. The likely locations for this logic are within `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/db/models/deletion.py`, and potentially `django/db/models/query.py` if the deletion logic extends to QuerySets. Searching specifically for implementations of `delete()` in these files should be effective.",

The search results include relevant code spans from the Django source, particularly in the Model class's delete method and the Collector class's delete method. The Model.delete method checks that the instance's primary key is not None before proceeding with deletion and does not explicitly reset the PK after deletion. The Collector.delete method handles the actual deletion and would be the ideal place to implement the PK reset functionality as suggested in the issue. The QuerySet.delete method is also relevant as it interacts with the Collector to perform deletions on querysets, but it does not directly influence the PK handling after deletion. The identified code spans provide enough context to understand how deletions are currently handled and where modifications should be made to address the reported issue.",

In `base.py`, the `delete()` method is found, but it doesn't handle setting the PK to None explicitly; it delegates deletion to a `Collector` instance. The `Collector` class in `deletion.py`, however, includes a `delete()` method that iterates over instances and sets their PKs to None after deletion.
