The issue specifies that the relevant code should be found near Django's model deletion handling, specifically at lines 276-281 in \"django/db/models/deletion.py\". Upon reviewing the search results, there are multiple relevant sections of code:\n\n1. \"django/db/models/base.py\" contains the `Model.delete` method, which is responsible for initiating the deletion process. This method calls the `Collector.collect` method from \"deletion.py\" to gather and delete related objects.\n\n2. In \"django/db/models/deletion.py\", the `Collector.delete` method is found. This method conducts the actual deletion of collected objects and updates the field values as necessary. This section of code includes the logic that should be examined and possibly modified to ensure that the PKs are set to None after deletion.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the most pertinent section of code is within the `Collector.delete` method in \"deletion.py\" at lines 291-359 in the search results.\n\nTo address the issue, code spans related to the `delete` method in both \"base.py\" and \"deletion.py\" should be identified and then modified to include the setting of PKs to None post-deletion.",
