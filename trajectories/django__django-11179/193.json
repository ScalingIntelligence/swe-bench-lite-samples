This is a specific problem within the Django ORM and needs to be addressed in the delete method of relevant model classes or in the deletion logic itself. Given the stack trace reference to Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, it suggests that modifications are needed around the delete functionality. Thus, it's essential to focus the search on the Django ORM's model deletion process, particularly in files containing the delete method and related deletion handlers.",

The analysis involves examining how the delete operation is carried out in the 'Model' class and the 'Collector' class within the Django codebase. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the 'Model.delete' method in 'django/db/models/base.py' and the 'Collector.delete' method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. These methods manage the deletion process and would need to be adjusted to ensure the PK is set to None after deletion, as per the issue's requirements. The 'Model.delete' method confirms the object has a PK before attempting deletion, while the 'Collector.delete' method orchestrates the actual deletion process. Modifications should focus on updating the PK after the deletion logic in the 'Collector.delete' method to align with the report's expectations.",
