Upon analyzing the search results, the `delete()` method is indeed found in two files: `django/db/models/deletion.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `delete()` method of the `Model` class calls the `Collector`'s `delete()` method. In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `delete()` method of the `Collector` class is where the actual deletion logic resides. Specifically, the issue mentions Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, which corresponds to the logic inside the `delete()` method of the `Collector` class. The current implementation does set the primary key to `None` at the end of the deletion process, which aligns with the requirement set out in the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are within these methods.",
