This requires modifications in both django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/deletion.py. \n\n2. In django/db/models/base.py, the relevant code spans are:\n   - The definition of the Model class and its methods.\n   - The Model.delete method which is responsible for deleting the model instance.\n   - The _get_pk_val and _set_pk_val methods, which handle the primary key value of the model.\n\n3. In django/db/models/deletion.py, the relevant code spans are:\n   - The Collector class which handles the deletion of related objects.\n   - The Collector.delete method, which is responsible for actually deleting the collected objects and should be where the PKs are updated to None.\n\n4. Based on the code, it seems the actual logic for updating the PKs should be placed within the Collector.delete method, as this is where the deletion process is handled and where setting the PK to None would make the most sense. This method iterates over all collected instances and deletes them, making it the appropriate place to set the PKs to None.\n\n5. The Model.delete method already includes a collector.collect() call and then a return collector.delete() call, so the logic for updating the PK should be implemented in the Collector.delete method.\n\n6. The current implementation does not update the PKs to None. The fix would require adding a line in the Collector.delete method after the objects are deleted to set the PKs to None for each deleted object.",

The `delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py` processes the deletion and, more importantly, includes code that sets the primary key to None after deletion.
