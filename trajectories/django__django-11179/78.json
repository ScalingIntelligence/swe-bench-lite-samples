The core parts of the Django ORM dealing with model deletion are located in two primary files: django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/deletion.py. In django/db/models/base.py, the Model class contains the delete() method which initiates the deletion process by creating an instance of the Collector class and using it to collect and delete related objects. The relevant span here is 'Model.delete'. In django/db/models/deletion.py, the Collector class handles the actual deletion logic. The 'Collector.delete' span is crucial because it iterates over collected instances and performs deletions, but it does not currently set the PK to None after deletion. This part of the code needs to be updated to address the issue, ensuring that after deletion, if there are no dependencies, the PK is set to None.",
