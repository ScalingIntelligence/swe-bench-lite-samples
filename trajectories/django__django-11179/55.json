The reported issue specifically mentions Django's `django.db.models.deletion` module, which suggests that changes are needed around or within the `Collector` class's `delete()` method. Initially, I noticed that the `delete()` method in `django/db/models/base.py` does not explicitly handle the resetting of primary keys after deletion, which aligns with the issue. Further, in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `delete()` method of the `Collector` class should be examined for the potential to reset the primary keys after deletion operations. It appears that the current implementation of `Collector.delete()` does not handle the resetting of primary keys as required by the issue. Therefore, this method, as well as potentially the `Model.delete()` method in `django/db/models/base.py`, need to be updated to ensure that primary keys are set to `None` after a model instance is deleted if no dependencies exist.",

The provided file context includes the relevant code from both the base model class and the deletion module, which are crucial for understanding and fixing the reported issue. In django/db/models/base.py, the delete() method is implemented to delete the instance using a Collector object. However, the primary key is not explicitly set to None in this implementation. Instead, a reference to line 280 in the deletion module is mentioned in the issue. In django/db/models/deletion.py, the Collector class and its delete() method handle the actual deletion process, including the setting of primary keys to None, as seen in the last lines of the delete() method.
