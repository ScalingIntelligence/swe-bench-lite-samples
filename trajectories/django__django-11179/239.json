The analysis of the provided code spans reveals several key areas relevant to the issue, particularly in how the 'Collector' class manages the deletion process and how the 'Model' and 'QuerySet' classes interact with deletions. Specifically, the 'Collector.delete()' method is responsible for collecting objects for deletion and then performing the actual deletion, but it currently does not handle the clearing of primary keys for the deleted instances. To resolve this, an enhancement should be made in 'Collector.delete()' to ensure that after an instance is deleted, its primary key is set to None.",
