The search results provide two key files: 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'base.py', the 'Model.delete' method is found relevant as it handles the deletion of model instances. The 'deletion.py' file contains the 'Collector' class, which is used to collect and delete related objects. Notably, the 'Collector.delete' method seems relevant as it manages the actual deletion of objects. However, neither of these currently set the PK to None after deletion. Based on the issue description, it seems the update should occur in 'deletion.py' around lines 276-281, but those specifics are not directly seen in the spans provided.
