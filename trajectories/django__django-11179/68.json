In 'deletion.py', the delete() method of the Collector class is found, which is responsible for handling the deletion of model instances. This method sorts instances by their primary key, checks if fast deletion is possible, and then enters a transaction to handle the deletion. The primary key is updated to None at the end of the deletion process. In 'base.py', the delete() method for the Model class is found, which initiates the deletion process by creating a Collector instance and then calling its delete() method. This confirms that the primary keys are set to None after deletion as required by the issue. Therefore, the search result is relevant to the reported issue.",
