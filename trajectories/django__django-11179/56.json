In the base.py file, the Model.delete method is found, which is the method responsible for deleting the model instance. It collects the instance to be deleted and then performs the delete operation. In the deletion.py file, the Collector.delete method is found, which is responsible for the actual deletion of the collected instances. The deletion process includes handling pre_delete and post_delete signals and performing the actual SQL delete operation.
