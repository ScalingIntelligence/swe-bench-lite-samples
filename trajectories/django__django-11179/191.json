Notably, the 'Model.delete' span in django/db/models/base.py currently does not update the PK to None. This is aligned with the reported issue. Additionally, the 'Collector.delete' span in django/db/models/deletion.py contains logic that could be modified to address the issue, specifically by setting the PK to None after deletion. This span includes the method where deleting model instances is handled. It seems pertinent to the issue to ensure PKs are reset after deletion operations.
