This suggests that the .delete() method needs to be updated to handle this case. Based on the provided context, the relevant code appears to be in the django/db/models/base.py file, specifically the delete() method within the Model class. Additionally, the issue mentions Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, indicating that the deletion logic in the deletion.py file is also relevant. It would be beneficial to review these specific parts of the code to understand how the .delete() method works and how the primary keys are managed during deletion.",

The Django documentation mentions that this change should be made around lines 276-281 in django/db/models/deletion.py. While scanning the provided search results, I identified the Model.delete() method and the Collector.delete() method as highly relevant. These methods handle the deletion process, and modifications within these can influence the behavior of the PK after deletion.\n\nThe Model.delete() method initializes a Collector object and uses it to collect and delete related objects. The Collector.delete() method contains logic that handles sending pre_delete and post_delete signals, deleting instances, and updating field values. These methods could be amended to ensure the PK of a model instance is set to None post-deletion if it has no dependencies. This approach ensures the deletion mechanism aligns with the reported issue's requirements by directly addressing the delete process that affects PK values.",
