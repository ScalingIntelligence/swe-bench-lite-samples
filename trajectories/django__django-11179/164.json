The search results, mainly from 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py', contain crucial information needed to identify the relevant code spans. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the method 'Model.delete' is defined as expected. This method delegates the deletion process to a 'Collector' object, which indicates where and how the deletion operations occur across the database. The 'Model.delete' method checks that the primary key is not None before further processing. This aligns with the concern of not clearing PKs, since it fails to address the need for setting PKs to None post-deletion. Digging further into `django/db/models/deletion.py`, particularly the `Collector` class, shows the sequence and management of object deletions, including batch deletions and the sending of pre_delete and post_delete signals. Note that each model's instances are reversed before deletion is executed in batches. Although this class manages deletion actions comprehensively, a key requirement mentioned in the issue - setting the PK to None after deletion - is missing from current implementations seen in both files. Nevertheless, from the evidence provided, 'django/db/models/base.py:Model.delete' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py:Collector.delete' seem to be critical starting points for drilling down into the issue's specifics to determine exactly where the PK attribute should be set to None upon object deletion.",
