The analysis of the search results aimed to find the relevant code spans that need to be modified or examined to address this issue. The primary focus was on the _delete_ method in the django/db/models/base.py file and the Collector.delete() method in the django/db/models/deletion.py file. The _delete_ method in base.py currently does not handle setting the PK to None after deletion, which aligns with the reported issue. The Collector.delete() method in deletion.py contains the logic for actually performing the deletion and does currently clear the PKs for instances, but might need adjustments to ensure it also sets them to None before returning. To fully resolve the issue, modifications in both the base.py and deletion.py files are likely necessary to ensure consistent behavior across different parts of the codebase.",
