According to the issue, the primary key (PK) should be set to None after a call to delete(). The specific area of interest is around line 280 in django/db/models/deletion.py. Thus, the focus should be on the delete method and its handling of the PK, specifically checking if it appropriately sets the PK to None. It seems that the current code in self.delete (in django/db/models/base.py) and the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py should be inspected to ensure correct behavior.",

The issue specifically references lines 276-281 in Django.db.models.deletion, suggesting a potential place to apply a fix. However, while searching for relevant code, we need to pay attention to how the delete operation is handled and how the PK might be affected as a result. In the search results, the `Model.delete` method definition seems relevant as it orchestrates the deletion process. Additionally, examining the `Collector` class in `django/db/models/deletion.py` is also important as it is the utility used by Django to collect related objects for deletion. Specific methods within these sections need to be analyzed further to check their interactions and implications on the instance properties, which could lead to identifying or suggesting fixes for the PK issue after deletion.",

I identified the relevant code spans by looking for logic related to model deletion and primary key management. In the 'Model.delete' method, the primary key is checked for None before deletion and assert is used, but no code to set the primary key to None after deletion. In the 'Collector.delete' method, after the deletion process, the primary key of the instance is set to None in the line 'setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)'. However, this logic seems to be missing or incorrectly placed outside the transaction.atomic context, which might not correctly update the model instances in the database. This part should be updated to ensure that the primary key of the model instance is set to None after deletion in the correct context. Therefore, I've identified the relevant spans in 'Model.delete' and 'Collector.delete' as critical and corrected or suggested the placement of the code to handle the primary key modification after deletion properly.",
