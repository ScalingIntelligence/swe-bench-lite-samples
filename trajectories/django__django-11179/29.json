The issue mentions specific lines in 'Django.db.models.deletion' which suggests that the problem lies within the deletion logic. Given the context and specific lines mentioned, I should focus the search on the 'django/db/models/deletion.py' file and particularly around line 280 where the 'delete' method is expected to be found. Additionally, the broader 'django/db/models/base.py' file should be checked for any related logic concerning the delete() method and the handling of primary keys.",

Focusing on the search results, the relevant code spans are primarily found within the 'django/db/models/deletion.py' file under the 'Collector.delete' method and within the 'django/db/models/base.py' file under the 'Model.delete' method. \n\nIn 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the 'delete' method of the 'Collector' class handles the deletion process for model instances. This method includes steps to sort instances, handle fast deletions, update fields, and finally delete instances. The critical part for addressing the issue appears at the end of this method, where after all deletions, the primary key attributes of the instances are set to None. This behavior supports the requirement mentioned in the issue. \n\nIn 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'delete' method of the 'Model' class invokes the deletion process through a 'Collector' instance. This method ensures that the delete operation is directed to the appropriate database and confirms that the instance has a primary key before deletion. Although this method does not directly handle the post-deletion state of the instance's PK, it is essential for understanding the overall deletion mechanism in Django's ORM. \n\nBased on the provided search results, the identified code spans directly address the issue by ensuring that deleted instances without dependencies have their PKs set to None. This identification completes the search task as it aligns well with the reported issue and the referenced code snippet in the issue description. \n\nThe JSON response below includes the relevant file paths and the IDs of the code spans that were identified as pertinent to the reported issue. Each span ID corresponds to the specific location in the code where critical actions related to deletion and PK handling take place. This structured information can be used by the development team to review, test, or modify the code as necessary to address the issue more comprehensively if any additional changes are required.",
