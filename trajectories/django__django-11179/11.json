The relevant code for this functionality resides in the `delete()` method of the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` and the `delete()` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. The `Model.delete()` method calls the `Collector.delete()` method, which is where the actual deletion logic resides. However, neither of these methods currently set the PK to None after deletion. The critical sections to focus on are the `delete()` methods in both files. The `Model.delete()` method ensures the instance's PK is not None before deletion, but it doesn't handle post-deletion state. The `Collector.delete()` method performs the actual database deletion and should be adjusted to set the PK to None for each instance after deletion. Additional relevant code spans include the imports and the `Collector.__init__` method, as they provide context on how the collector is initialized and used.",
