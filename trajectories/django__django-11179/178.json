The detailed examination of the provided search results focused on two primary files: `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py`. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the relevant code span is `Model.delete`, which contains the implementation of the `.delete()` method for `Model`. This method uses a `Collector` object to manage the deletion process, but it does not currently set the PK to `None`. In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the crucial code span is `Collector.delete`, which handles the actual deletion logic, including the updating of fields. However, this section also lacks the mention of setting the PK to `None`. The search task can be considered complete as the identified code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue, requiring updates to ensure the PK is set to `None` post-deletion.",
