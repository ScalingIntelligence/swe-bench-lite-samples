The search results provide context from Django's models base file, specifically focusing on the Model class and its methods. The imports section indicates that the file is related to model manipulations, and the Model class includes the __init__ and delete methods. The __init__ method is responsible for initializing model instances, which is relevant but does not directly address the deletion process. The delete method, on the other hand, is directly related to the issue as it deals with the deletion logic of model instances. It collects the instance to be deleted and then performs the deletion. This method is where the update to set the PK to None after deletion should be implemented to address the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code span is the delete method within the Model class.",

The current implementation of the `delete` method in the `Model` class checks if the object's primary key is not None before proceeding with the delete operation. There is no explicit code to set the primary key to None after deleting the object. The `Collector` class in the `deletion.py` file handles the actual deletion process and might need to be updated to include setting primary keys to None. The `delete` method in the `Collector` class dispatches pre_delete and post_delete signals but does not modify the primary keys of the deleted objects. To address the issue, the `delete` method in the `Collector` class should be updated to iterate over the instances of each model after deletion and set their primary keys to None.
