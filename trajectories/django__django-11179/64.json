The search results provide relevant code spans in 'django/db/models/base.py' for 'Model.delete()' and in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' for the 'Collector' class and its methods. Here, the 'Model.delete()' method uses the 'Collector' to manage the deletion process, where 'Collector.delete()' method eventually deletes the objects. However, these spans do not directly set the PK to None after deletion in cases without dependencies, which aligns with the reported issue. To address this, we need to identify where in the 'Collector.delete()' method, after performing the deletion, the PK could be set to None for objects with no dependencies. The current code does not directly address this, so additional logic would be required within the 'Collector.delete()' method to handle this requirement.",
