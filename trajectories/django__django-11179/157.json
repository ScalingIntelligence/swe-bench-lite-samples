Given the description and reference to Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, it's essential to focus on the deletion mechanism within the models and how PKs are handled post-deletion. Two primary areas to investigate are the Model class in django/db/models/base.py for the delete method and the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py. It's likely that adjustments or additional logic are needed around line 280 in django/db/models/deletion.py to address the PK setting to None upon deletion.",
