The issue is that the primary key (PK) is not set to None after the delete operation. The problem is specified to be around line 280 of `django/db/models/deletion.py`. Upon reviewing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are identified as follows: The `delete()` method in `django/db/models/base.py` at span_id 'Model.delete', and in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `delete()` method in class `Collector` at span_id 'Collector.delete'. These spans encapsulate the logic responsible for deleting model instances and managing dependencies, which is directly related to the reported issue. The analysis of these spans suggests that while the deletion logic is present, the explicit setting of the PK to None after deletion is not currently implemented. This aligns with the observed issue and provides the necessary context for potential modifications.",
