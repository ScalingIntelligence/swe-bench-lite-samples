This requires examining the `delete()` method in Django's `Model` class and how the deletion process within the `Collector` class handles the deletion of models without related objects. The search results provided include the `Model.delete` method and relevant parts of the `Collector` class. Analyzing these sections, I identified the `Model.delete` method where the actual deletion logic is initiated, and the `Collector.delete` method where the deletion process is completed. The `delete()` method of the `Model` class calls the `Collector` to manage the deletion, which includes handling related objects, emitting signals, and finally deleting the objects. The specific part of the issue that involves setting PKs to None after deletion is not explicitly addressed in the provided code spans. However, this seems to be handled by the `Collector.delete` method where after deleting the objects, the primary keys of the remaining instances are set to `None`. This aligns with the issue's requirement. Therefore, these code spans are relevant as they contain the deletion logic and handling of PKs.",
