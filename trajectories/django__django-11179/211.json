The expected behavior is that the primary key (PK) should be set to None after the delete operation. Upon analyzing the provided search results, the code spans that are relevant to this issue are found in both 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'Model' class contains the 'delete' method, which is responsible for deleting model instances. However, the primary key is not explicitly set to None within this method. Instead, this functionality is handled in the 'Collector' class within 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. The 'Collector.delete' method processes the deletion of model instances and includes logic to set the primary key to None for each instance after deletion. This aligns with the reported issue's requirement to update the primary key to None post-deletion. Thus, the relevant code spans are those within the 'Model.delete' method in 'django/db/models/base.py' and the 'Collector.delete' method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'.",

In the provided file context, the delete() method in django/db/models/base.py does not explicitly set the PK to None.

This suggests that the relevant code for PK manipulation upon deletion is indeed provided in the file context. However, the base.py file's delete() method does not explicitly handle the PK update, instead delegating it to the Collector.
