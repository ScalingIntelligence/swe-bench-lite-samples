The issue is described as not updating the PK to 'None' after the .delete() call, as it should. The hint points to 'Django.db.models.deletion:276-281' indicating these lines within this module might be critical to investigate. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the `delete` method within the `Model` class and the `delete` function within the `Collector` class in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' is logical. Additionally, examining the broader context of model deletion mechanics may uncover the necessary changes needed to update PKs upon model deletion.",

The analysis of the provided file context reveals relevant code spans in the 'Model.delete' method and the 'Collector.delete' method. These methods handle the deletion process and should be modified to update the PKs to None. The new search results provide additional methods within the 'Collector' class that support the deletion process, including methods like 'add', 'add_field_update', 'can_fast_delete', 'get_del_batches', 'collect', 'related_objects', 'instances_with_model', and 'sort'. These methods are part of the deletion workflow and were not initially present in the file context. Specifically, the 'Collector.delete' method should set the PKs to None for instances of models without dependencies after deletion. The identified spans in the 'Model.delete' and 'Collector.delete' methods, along with the new methods in 'Collector', are essential for understanding and implementing the solution to the reported issue.
