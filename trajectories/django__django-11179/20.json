The issue reference points to django/db/models/deletion.py specifically at lines 276-281, indicating that the necessary update might not be happening at line 280. Given this information, the focus should be on the `deletion.py` file and the `delete` method within the `Collector` class or related functions.

Additionally, examining the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` might provide insights since it also implements a `delete` method.
