The search results provide insights into how deletion is handled in Django's `Model` class and the `Collector` class. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.delete` method is responsible for deleting instances and involves the `Collector` class to handle related objects. The `Collector` class in `django/db/models/deletion.py` has methods like `collect`, `delete`, and `instances_with_model` which manage collecting and deleting objects. However, the current implementation of `Model.delete` does not set the PK to None, which aligns with the user's issue. This is evident in the `Collector.delete` method where objects are deleted, but there's no specific code to set their PKs to None.",

The relevant code for this operation should be found in either the model's delete() method or in the deletion handling functions. The file context includes code from both django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/deletion.py. Specifically, in django/db/models/deletion.py, the Collector class's delete() method appears to handle the deletion process and already contains logic to set the PK to None after deletion (see the line 'for instance in instances: setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)'). This seems to address the requirement directly. The django/db/models/base.py file context contains the Model class's delete() method, which calls the Collector to perform the deletion, suggesting that this part of the file context is also relevant as it initiates the deletion process.
