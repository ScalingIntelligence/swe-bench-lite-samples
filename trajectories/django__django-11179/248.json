The issue specifies that the primary key (PK) should be set to None after the .delete() call. The relevant code spans provided in the search results include the 'delete' method within the 'Collector' class and the 'delete' method within the 'Model' class. Both of these methods are critically examined to check how the primary key is handled during the delete operation. The 'Collector.delete' method processes the deletion of model instances and updates related fields, but does not explicitly set the primary key to None for each instance in the loop as expected from the reported issue. The 'Model.delete' method invokes the collector's delete method but does not directly handle setting the primary key to None. To address the issue, the 'Collector.delete' method must be updated to ensure that the primary key of each deleted instance is set to None before returning.",
