            "scratch_pad": "The issue specifies that when deleting a model instance with no dependencies, the primary key (PK) is not updated to None. The issue mentions checking Django's 'deletion' module, specifically lines 276-281. This suggests that the problem might be within the delete method or related functions in the 'deletion' module or the base model class. Given the significant impact of this issue on the integrity of data after deletion, it's crucial to ensure that the PKs are properly managed. Therefore, my approach will focus first on the 'deletion' module and the 'base' model module where the delete method is defined, to identify adjustments needed to properly reset PKs post-deletion. I will also consider the 'fields/related.py' file as it relates to ForeignKey which might impact deletion processes, and 'query.py' which also explicitly mentions a delete method in the QuerySet class.",
