Directly relevant code spans are found in the 'delete' method of the 'Collector' class within 'django/db/models/deletion.py', as well as the 'delete' method within the 'Model' class in 'django/db/models/base.py'. The 'Collector.delete' method contains the logic for batch deletes and the 'Model.delete' method is responsible for deleting individual model instances. Each method performs the deletion but does not explicitly set the primary key to None after deletion. These spans are highly relevant as they directly address the issue's concern of PK handling during deletion, offering the exact lines within the Django source code that need updating for the reported issue. Analyzing more of the context provided in the 'delete' method of both classes confirms this finding by showing that while the PK value is used during deletion, it's not set to None after the delete operation is executed.",
