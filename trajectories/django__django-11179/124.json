This requires modifying the `.delete()` method in Django's model implementation. From the search results, the relevant code spans are located in two files: `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py`. \n\n1. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.delete()` method is found, which is responsible for initiating the deletion process. However, this method itself does not handle the setting of the PK to None, which is a necessary change for resolving the issue. The current behavior is to assert that the PK is not None before proceeding with the deletion.\n\n2. The `Collector.delete()` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py` contains the logic for actually deleting model instances and handling their dependencies. The key span here is the final for-loop where instances are processed after being deleted. This is where the PK should be set to None for each instance, which is not currently done. By modifying this loop to set the PK to None, the issue can be resolved.\n\nThe task is complete as the relevant code spans necessary for addressing the reported issue have been identified: specifically, the `Model.delete()` method in `django/db/models/base.py` and the `Collector.delete()` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. These spans indicate where the PK should be updated after deletion.",
