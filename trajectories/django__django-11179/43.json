The issue points specifically to lines 276-281 in Django's `models.deletion` module, suggesting an update to the model's handling of this case.\n\nAfter reviewing the search results, especially focused on the `django/db/models/deletion.py` and `django/db/models/base.py` files, I identified two key areas of interest:\n\n1. The `Collector.delete()` method in `deletion.py` is responsible for orchestrating the deletion of objects, including those without dependencies.\n2. The `Model.delete()` method in `base.py` initiates the deletion process, creating a `Collector` instance to handle the deletion.\n\nKey points to note:\n- The `Collector.delete()` method already contains logic for setting primary keys to None after deleting the instances.\n- The issue suggests an additional check or update around lines 276-281, but based on the current code, the PKs are already set to None, which aligns with the issue's requirement.\n\nSince the current implementation in the `Collector.delete()` method already performs the necessary action of setting PKs to None, and the issue does not specify additional changes needed in those lines, the current search results fully address the issue.\n\nIdentified Spans:\n- Relevant class: `Collector`\n- Relevant function: `Collector.delete()`\n- Relevant file: `django/db/models/deletion.py`\n- Span IDs related to the 'Collector' class and its methods directly involve handling delete operations and post-deletion states.\n",
