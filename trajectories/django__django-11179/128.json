The search results provided contain the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file, which appears to be the relevant file based on the provided file path hint (Django.db.models.deletion). Within this file, there is a method `Collector.delete()` that seems to handle the deletion process. It iterates over models and instances, potentially sending `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals, and then proceeds to delete instances. The line `setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)` at the end of the `delete` method aligns with the requirement to set the PK to None after deletion. Therefore, the span containing this line is marked as relevant. However, the issue specifically mentions fixing the behavior to set PKs to None without needing modifications outside of the provided section, so I'll mark the entire `delete` section as relevant.",
