The issue specifically points to Django's deletion logic, particularly lines 276-281 in django/db/models/deletion.py, as the area needing an update. Upon examining the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are located in the 'Collector.delete' method within django/db/models/deletion.py. This method is responsible for handling the deletion process of model instances and includes logic for setting primary keys to None as part of its post-delete operations. Additionally, the 'Model.delete' method in django/db/models/base.py initializes the deletion process by creating a Collector instance and triggering the collection and deletion processes. The 'QuerySet.delete' method in django/db/models/query.py also collaborates with the Collector to handle batch deletions. All these methods are part of Django's ORM and are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue at hand. However, the specific line in question (setting PK to None) is found in 'Collector.delete', which appears to be already implemented but may need adjustment based on the issue description.",
