Specifically, the issue mentions that the primary keys (PKs) are not being set to None after a `.delete()` call, which is expected behavior. Given the reference to Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, it's clear that the modification or addition to the existing deletion logic should be around that area. Hence, focusing on the 'delete' method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' makes sense. Additionally, considering 'django/db/models/base.py' as it contains the base Model class which likely includes the 'delete' method implementation.",
