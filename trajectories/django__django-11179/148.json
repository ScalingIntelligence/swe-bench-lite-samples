The provided context suggests that the relevant code may be found in `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py`. To address the issue, we need to focus on the `delete()` method and any related functionality that handles primary key management post-deletion. The specific range `Django.db.models.deletion:276-281` mentioned in the issue description also points directly to the `deletion.py` file, indicating that the modification should be made in that range. The search should concentrate on these parameters to find the exact part of the code that needs updating.",

This is to prevent dangling PKs in the database, which could potentially lead to confusion or errors. The analysis starts by reviewing the code related to the delete method in the provided search results. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'Model.delete' method is assessed. This method calls a 'Collector' object to handle the deletion process. Within 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the 'Collector.delete' method is examined. This method initiates a transaction and sends pre_delete and post_delete signals. It also processes fast deletes and field updates. The critical part is at the end of the 'Collector.delete' method where it iterates over the models and their instances to set their PKs to None. This functionality matches the requirement of the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to resolving the reported issue.",
