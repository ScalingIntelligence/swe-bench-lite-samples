The reported issue specifically mentions line 280 in `django.db.models.deletion`, which corresponds to the `Collector.delete` method. This method is responsible for actually performing the deletion and updating fields. Currently, the code in `Collector.delete` does not explicitly set the PK to None for the deleted instances. The relevant code spans include the `Model.delete` method where the collector is called, and the `Collector.delete` method where the actual deletion happens and fields might be updated. The proposed solution is to modify `Collector.delete` to ensure that the PK is set to None for each instance after deletion.",

The method collects instances to be deleted, sorts them, and then performs the deletions within a transaction. After the deletions, it updates the fields as specified in `self.field_updates` and sets the primary key (PK) of each instance to None. This last step addresses the issue of updating the PKs to None after deletion of models with no dependencies. No further action seems necessary as the logic already implemented within the `delete` method in the `Collector` class fulfills the requirement set out in the issue.",
