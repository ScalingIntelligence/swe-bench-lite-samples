The search results include two files: 'django/db/models/deletion.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'.

Notably, the code already includes setting the PK to None for each instance after deletion (last loop in the 'delete' method). In 'base.py', the 'Model.delete' method is found, which is responsible for initializing the deletion process by creating a 'Collector' and collecting the instance to be deleted.
