This behavior seems to be a part of the deletion process within Django's ORM. To address the issue, two main files are relevant: 'django/db/models/deletion.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'. The 'Collector.delete' method in 'deletion.py' is responsible for managing the deletion of objects and already includes logic that sets the PK to None after deletion. This is done to ensure that the instance's PK is appropriately managed post-deletion, which aligns with the reported issue. Additionally, the 'Model.delete' method in 'base.py' coordinates the overall deletion process, integrating with the Collector class from 'deletion.py'. However, the 'Model.delete' method itself does not explicitly set the PK to None; this responsibility is delegated to the Collector. In summary, the current implementation appears to handle the PK setting correctly post-deletion, as described in the issue. Therefore, the identified code spans from 'django/db/models/deletion.py' demonstrate the relevant logic.",
