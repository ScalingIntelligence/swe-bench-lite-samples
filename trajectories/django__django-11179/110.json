This directly relates to the delete functionality within the Django ORM. The issue specifically mentions Django.db.models.deletion, which suggests focusing on the Collector class within django/db/models/deletion.py.\n\nReviewing the provided code spans, the Model class's delete method in django/db/models/base.py is relevant as it initializes the delete process by creating a Collector instance. However, the critical adjustment needed seems to be within the Collector class's delete method in django/db/models/deletion.py, where the final setting of primary keys to None after deletion should be implemented.\n\nThe relevant spans are `Model.delete` from django/db/models/base.py which initiates the delete operation, and `Collector.delete` from django/db/models/deletion.py which handles the actual deletion process and where the setting of PK to None should be implemented. This aligns with line 280 mentioned in the issue, indicating that code within the `Collector.delete` method should be modified.",
