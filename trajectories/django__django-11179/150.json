Specifically, it mentions that the primary keys (PKs) of these models are not being set to None after a delete() call, which is the expected behavior. The search results include code spans from several Django files that are relevant to this issue. Notably, the 'delete' method in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' contains logic for deleting instances, including steps for updating the PKs of the instances to None. This directly addresses the issue at hand. Additionally, the 'delete' method in 'django/db/models/base.py' coordinates the deletion process, including the use of the Collector class from 'deletion.py'. The 'delete' method in 'django/db/models/query.py' also relates to the deletion process within the context of a QuerySet. While 'django/core/cache/backends/db.py' contains a 'delete' method, it deals with cache deletion and is not directly relevant to the model deletion issue in question.",

The `djang/db/models/deletion.py` file contains the `Collector` class with a `delete()` method that iterates over the models and their instances, calling `sql.DeleteQuery(model).delete_batch(pk_list, self.using)` for each. After deletion, it sets the primary key attribute to None for each instance in the `if not model._meta.auto_created:` block. The issue's concern seems to be addressed in the provided `Collector.delete()` method, where the primary key is set to None after the delete operation.
