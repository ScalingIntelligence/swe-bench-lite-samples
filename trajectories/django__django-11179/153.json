The reference to Django.db.models.deletion:276-281 suggests that the issue might be within the deletion logic of the Django ORM. Given the context, it's likely that the fix involves modifying the deletion process to update the PKs of models or ensuring a proper clearing mechanism. Investigating the delete method in django/db/models/base.py and the related deletion logic in django/db/models/deletion.py should be a priority.",

The key sections to focus on are the `Model.delete` method in `django/db/models/base.py` and the `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. The `Model.delete` method initiates the delete process and utilizes the `Collector` class to handle the deletion and related operations. The `Collector.delete` method is responsible for handling the actual deletion and signaling. However, upon reviewing the `Collector.delete` method, I noticed that it does not currently set the Primary Key (PK) to None after deletion. This is where the update should occur to ensure that the PK is cleared after a model instance is deleted, as per the reported issue. Identifying these sections of the code is crucial because they directly deal with the deletion process and need to be updated to include the functionality to set the PKs to None for models without dependencies.",
