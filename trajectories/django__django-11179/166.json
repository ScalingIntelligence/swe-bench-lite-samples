This span includes code that updates fields, sends delete signals, and eventually deletes instances based on their primary keys.

Therefore, the code span that needs to be updated is line 280 within the 'delete' method of the 'Collector' class, where after the deletion logic, explicit code should be added to set the primary key to None for the instances where primary keys are not automatically set (i.e., models without dependencies).",
