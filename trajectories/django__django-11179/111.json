I analyzed the search results to identify relevant code spans that address this functionality. The main focus is on the `Model.delete` method in `django/db/models/base.py` and the `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`. The `Model.delete` method initiates the deletion process, while the `Collector.delete` method handles the actual deletion logic. Notably, the `Collector.delete` method currently does not set the PK to None after deletion, which aligns with the reported issue. For models like `FieldFile` and `ImageFieldFile` in `django/db/models/fields/files.py`, the `.delete()` method has a different implementation not directly related to setting PKs to None. The `QuerySet.delete` method in `django/db/models/query.py` orchestrates the deletion of multiple objects but delegates the actual deletion to the `Collector`. Therefore, the relevant code span to address the reported issue is within `django/db/models/deletion.py`, specifically the `Collector.delete` method.",
