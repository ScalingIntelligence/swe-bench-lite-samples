The provided file context includes relevant sections from `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py`. Specifically, the `delete()` method in `base.py` initializes a `Collector` and calls its `delete()` method. In `deletion.py`, the `Collector` class handles the actual deletion logic, including updates to fields and sending pre and post delete signals. The critical part is the absence of an explicit line in the `Collector` class's `delete()` method that sets the PK to `None`. This aligns with the issue's request.
