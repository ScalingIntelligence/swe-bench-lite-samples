This is the key aspect we need to ensure is addressed in the code. The search results provide relevant code in two files: 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'Model.delete' method is found, which initiates the deletion process. However, it does not currently set the PK to None. In 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the 'Collector.delete' method is where the actual deletion and possibly the update of the PK to None should occur, based on the issue's requirement. This method, however, does not currently handle the setting of the PK to None for models without dependencies. The issue specifically references 'Django.db.models.deletion:276-281', suggesting that line 280 in 'Collector.delete' might need modification to implement this behavior. This analysis indicates that the search results do contain relevant code, particularly the 'Collector.delete' method, which needs to be amended to resolve the issue.",
