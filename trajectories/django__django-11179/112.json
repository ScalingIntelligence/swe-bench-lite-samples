This requires examining the delete method in the Model class and the Collector class in Django's models. The search results provide both the Model.delete method and the Collector.delete method. In Model.delete, it chains to the Collector to handle the deletion. In Collector.delete, it handles the actual deletion of objects and their related objects. However, it does not explicitly set the primary keys to None for the instances being deleted if they have no dependencies. To address the issue, it would be necessary to modify the Collector.delete method to include setting the primary key to None before or after the deletion of the object, depending on whether it has dependencies.",
