This suggests a modification to the delete method in Django's Model class or the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py. The search results contain two relevant files: django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/deletion.py. In django/db/models/base.py, the `Model.delete` method is found, which is part of the Django Model class and serves as a likely starting point for implementing the desired functionality. In django/db/models/deletion.py, the `Collector.delete` method is found, which is responsible for the actual deletion and could potentially be modified to handle the setting of the PKs to None. The code spans in both methods need to be reviewed and adjusted if necessary. Based on the reported issue, modifications should likely be added to these parts of the code to ensure that PKs are set to None after a delete operation on models without dependencies.",
