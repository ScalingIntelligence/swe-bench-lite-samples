The main focus was on understanding how delete operations are handled and how PK values are currently managed. I started by examining the 'Model.delete' span in 'django/db/models/base.py', which indicates that after a delete operation, the object's state should assert that its PK is not None. This is consistent with the current behavior. However, the issue suggests that PKs should be set to None after the delete. Next, I reviewed the 'Collector.delete' span in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' where the delete operations are managed. Here, I noticed that there's a section for 'fast_deletes' and a broader delete process that iterates over models and their instances. A key observation was the absence of a command that explicitly sets the PK to None for deleted instances. This is a crucial aspect to address the issue. Adding a command within the 'Collector.delete' method to set the PK to None for deleted instances, especially for models without dependencies, would fix the issue. The relevant spans are: 'Model.delete' in 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'Collector.delete' in 'django/db/models/deletion.py'.",
