The issue indicates that the primary key (PK) of the model is not being set to None after a delete() call, as it should. This suggests a need to review the logic in the delete() method, particularly in the django/db/models/base.py file and possibly related files such as django/db/models/deletion.py. The code snippet 'django/db/models/deletion:276-281' provided in the issue description will be used as a reference to pinpoint the exact location of the code that might need an update. Given the detailed description and context, it seems clear that focusing on the 'delete' method in the context of model instances and their primary keys is the correct approach.",

The search results provided include code spans from two files: 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. \n\nIn 'django/db/models/base.py', there's a 'Model.delete' method that handles the deletion process for model instances and interacts with the 'Collector' class. This method is crucial for understanding how deletion works in Django models.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the 'Collector.delete' method is found. This method is responsible for the actual deletion logic, including handling dependencies and sending deletion signals. Additionally, it appears to manage the setting of PKs to None after deletion, as suggested by the issue. The relevant line for updating PKs (line 280) is not directly found in the provided spans, but the context of the entire method suggests it would handle such updates.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, these two methods - 'Model.delete' and 'Collector.delete' - are highly relevant as they directly impact the deletion process and PK handling in Django models. Thus, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
