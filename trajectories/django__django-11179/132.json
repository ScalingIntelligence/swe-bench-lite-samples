The search results include relevant code spans from multiple files and methods, particularly focused on the `Model.delete` method in `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Collector` class in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, and the `QuerySet.delete` method in `django/db/models/query.py`. Moreover, it is important that this process happens only for models with no dependencies so that models with associations (like foreign keys) are handled correctly as intended. As per user's reference in the issue, Django.db.models.deletion.276-281 also highlights the need to check and update the deletion logic here as well. Analyzing the provided code snippets, the key areas to focus on are the `Model.delete` method where the actual deletion happens, the `Collector` class handling the collection of objects for deletion. Since the issue states models with no dependencies, the logic in `can_fast_delete` of the `Collector` class also seems pertinent as it decides if the deletion can happen without triggering cascading effects. However, none of the spans explicitly handle the setting of PK to None post-deletion when there are no dependencies, which is highlighted by the user's reported issue. It suggests additional code modifications or overrides are needed to specifically address the requirement to clear PKs in such instances. Thus, the search results provide a foundation to implement or adjust the deletion logic, particularly focusing on where dependency check and primary key handling can be inserted or modified within the `Model.delete` method or associated deletion functions.",
