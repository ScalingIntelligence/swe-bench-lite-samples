This suggests modifying the delete() method in the Django ORM to handle the PK setting post-deletion. The search results provide valuable context in the form of the Model.delete() method in django/db/models/base.py, which currently manages the deletion process without altering the PK. Additionally, the Collector.delete() method in django/db/models/deletion.py orchestrates the deletion of model instances, which could be the appropriate place to add logic for setting PKs to None after deletion. Lastly, the QuerySet.delete() method in django/db/models/query.py and the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class in django/db/backends/base/schema.py, while related to database operations and schema management, do not directly address the issue at hand.

The current file context and search results are focused on the `Model.delete` method and the `Collector` class, which is responsible for collecting and deleting model instances. These sections include the logic for deleting instances and the necessary steps to ensure the PK is updated. From the current context, the relevant files and code spans have been identified, particularly in the `Model.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method, where the PK setting logic resides. The search results validate the presence of the necessary code spans within the specified files, ensuring that all relevant parts of the codebase are considered. Therefore, based on the analysis, the relevant code spans have been identified and the search task can be considered complete.",
