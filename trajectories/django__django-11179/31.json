The issue specifically references the Django.db.models.deletion module, and mentions lines 276-281 where the update might be needed. To address the issue, focus on the delete method in the Model class and the delete methods in the QuerySet class, as they are central to the deletion processes in Django models. Additionally, explore the deletion handling in the Collector class and within the schema editor for possible points of intervention.",

Specifically, it states that the Primary Key (PK) of the model instance is not set to None after deletion. The issue references Django.db.models.deletion:276-281 and suggests that the model's delete method should be updated. I have identified the relevant code spans in the search results, focusing on the delete method implementation in django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/query.py. The delete method in django/db/models/base.py does not currently set the PK to None after deletion, which aligns with the issue's description. I also examined django/db/models/deletion.py to understand how deletions are handled with respect to dependencies, although it does not directly affect the setting of PKs. Based on the analysis, the identified code span in django/db/models/base.py should be further examined and possibly modified to address the issue. The search task is not yet complete as the necessary modification to the delete method to set the PK to None post-deletion has not been applied.",
