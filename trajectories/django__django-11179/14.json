This directly addresses the issue mentioned, so I included the relevant code span in my findings. I also checked the 'Model.delete' method in 'django/db/models/base.py' to ensure that there's a proper process initiating the deletion, which indeed it does by calling the 'Collector.delete' method. This confirms that the identified section in 'Collector.delete' is invoked during the deletion process of a model instance. It's crucial to mention that although the immediate issue seems resolved, potential broader implications such as cascading deletions or other related effects should be considered outside this code analysis.",

The line setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None) within the delete method ensures that the primary key is set to None after deletion. Additionally, the base.py file context shows the delete method of the Model class, which initializes the deletion process.
