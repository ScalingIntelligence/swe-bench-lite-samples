            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the behavior of the `delete()` method in Django models, specifically when deleting instances without any dependencies. The issue states that the primary key (PK) should be set to `None` after the delete operation. This functionality is expected to be implemented around line 280 in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file.\n\nUpon examining the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are within the `Model.delete` method and the `Collector.delete` method. Notably, the `Model.delete` method calls the `Collector` to handle the deletion, and the `Collector.delete` method performs the actual deletion and possibly updates field values. However, in the provided code, there isn't a direct implementation of setting the PK to `None` after deletion. The code in `Collector.delete` involves sending pre and post delete signals, updating fields if necessary, and finally, deleting the instances. There's potential to insert the logic of setting the PK to `None` in the part of the code where instances are being processed after deletion. Since the issue references `deletion.py:276-281`, it implies we should look closely at the `Collector.delete` method starting from around line 276 in the actual codebase to pinpoint the exact location for the required update.\n\nGiven the complexity and critical nature of the `delete` operation in Django, especially concerning data integrity and signals, and understanding the reference given in the issue for lines 276-281 in `deletion.py`, it's clear that the actions should be taken with caution. It's advisable to delve deeper into the actual codebase on GitHub or the Django source to ensure that the exact location for introducing the fix is verified and that it aligns with the overall design and ideology of Django's data manipulation principles.\n\nIn conclusion, the identified code spans from the `base.py` file and the `deletion.py` file are relevant, particularly focusing on the `Model.delete` and `Collector.delete` methods. However, based on the issue's request for setting PKs to `None` after deletion, there seems to be an expectation for a more specialized modification in the deletion process, which is deduced from the reference to specific lines. For now, considering these chunks as the starting point for addressing the issue.",
