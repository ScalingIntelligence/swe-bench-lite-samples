            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue of ensuring that primary keys (PKs) are set to None after deleting model instances without dependencies, I need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the deletion process. The issue specifically mentions Django's deletion handling around line 276-281 in django/db/models/deletion.py. This file is crucial as it contains the `Collector` class that manages the deletion of model instances and their dependencies.\n\nGiven the <search_results> provided, I will focus on django/db/models/deletion.py, django/db/models/base.py, and django/db/models/fields/files.py as they contain key methods (`delete` on models and fields) directly related to deletion.\n\n1. In django/db/models/deletion.py, the `Collector` class's `delete` method (span id 'Collector.delete') is crucial as it orchestrates the deletion of objects and manages signals and transactions during deletion. This is where the models' primary keys could potentially be reset to None after deletion.\n\n2. In django/db/models/base.py, the `delete` method on the `Model` class (span id 'Model.delete') is where individual model instances are deleted. This method also involves the `Collector` to handle dependent objects, which makes it a relevant place to check for PK updates.\n\n3. In django/db/models/fields/files.py, the `delete` method on `FieldFile` (span id 'FieldFile.delete') and `ImageFieldFile` (span id 'ImageFieldFile.delete') handle file deletions and might affect model instances, but they are less directly related to the PK issue unless there's an indirect effect through file handling.\n\nBased on the analysis, the primary candidate for addressing the PK setting to None after deletion is in the deletion logic within django/db/models/deletion.py, specifically `Collector.delete`. Other files and spans are important for a broader context, but the core action to update model PKs upon deletion is likely to be found or influenced by the code in django/db/models/deletion.py.",
