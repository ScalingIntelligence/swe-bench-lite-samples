To address this, we need to investigate the `delete()` method in the Django model system. Specifically, the issue mentions Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, indicating that the line 280 of that file might need updating to ensure PKs are set to None after a `.delete()` call. Given the context provided, the focus should be on the `delete()` method in both `models.base.Model` and `models.deletion.Collector`. Additionally, checking related fields handling in `models.fields.related` and the behavior of the `delete()` method in `models.query.QuerySet` might also be relevant for a comprehensive understanding. Lastly, ensuring that admin and schema editor classes do not interfere with this logic should also be considered.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the primary key (PK) not being set to None after calling .delete() on instances of models with no dependencies. This issue seems to be relevant to the Django ORM's deletion process. To address this, we need to find the place in the code where the delete operation is handled and ensure that the primary key is set to None after deletion. The search results provide several relevant files and code spans: 1. **django/db/models/base.py**: Contains the delete method for the Model class, which orchestrates the deletion process. It uses a Collector to manage deletions. 2. **django/db/models/deletion.py**: Contains the implementation of the Collector class, which is responsible for collecting and deleting related objects and managing field updates and deletions. It also includes the delete method, which should be the focus for updating the primary key. 3. **django/db/models/query.py**: Contains the delete method for QuerySet, which uses the Collector to handle deletions. This is more about batch deletions but still relevant to understanding the deletion flow. 4. **django/db/models/fields/files.py**: Contains the delete method for FieldFile and ImageFieldFile, which handle file deletions. This is less relevant to the issue at hand but still provides context on how Django handles deletions of different types.\n\n From the provided code, the most relevant spans are within django/db/models/deletion.py and django/db/models/base.py. Specifically, the delete method in django/db/models/deletion.py needs to be examined to ensure that the primary key is set to None after deleting a model instance. The relevant span within django/db/models/deletion.py is where the primary key is explicitly set to None, which can be found in the block of code where the keyword 'None' is used in the context of primary keys.\n\n In order to fix the primary key issue, the critical modification would be to add or adjust the code where the primary key (PK) is set to None after the deletion process in the Collector class. This ensures that when .delete() is called on a model instance where there are no dependencies, the primary key is indeed set to None.",
