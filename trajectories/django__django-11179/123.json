This task requires identifying the relevant code spans in the provided search results where the delete() method is defined and subsequently where the primary keys might be updated. From the search results, we can see that the delete() method is defined in the Model class within the django/db/models/base.py file. Additionally, the delete method in the Collector class within django/db/models/deletion.py might also be relevant as it handles the actual deletion process. The task is to find and focus on the parts of the code where the primary keys could be set to None after deletion. Looking at the code spans provided, the Model.delete span in base.py does not currently set the PK to None, and we need to identify if the deletion process might set it to None in the deletion.py file. In the Collector.delete span, we can see the deletion process, but it doesn't explicitly set the PKs to None. The search results cover the essential parts of the deletion process in Django's models, and focusing on the two main spans in the base.py and deletion.py files should provide a scope to address the reported issue.",
