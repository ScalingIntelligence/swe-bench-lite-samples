This implies that the problem lies within the delete functionality of Django's models. Specifically, the mention of Django.db.models.deletion:276-281 suggests that the code handling the deletion logic needs to be adjusted to update the PK. Given the context and the need to update the PK after a delete operation, focusing on the delete method in django/db/models/base.py and the related deletion handling in django/db/models/deletion.py seems appropriate.",

The search results include relevant sections from `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py`. In `base.py`, the `Model.delete` method is found, which is responsible for the deletion logic of model instances. This method collects related objects and calls `collector.delete()`. However, there is no explicit logic to set the PK to None after deletion. In `deletion.py`, the `Collector.delete` method is identified, which handles the actual deletion of collected objects and includes logic for sending signals. Notably, there is a comment that suggests setting the PK to None for each instance after deletion. This aligns with the requirement of the reported issue. Therefore, modifications should be made in the `Collector.delete` method to ensure that PKs are set to None for models without dependencies.",
