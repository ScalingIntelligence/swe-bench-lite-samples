The issue specifies that the primary key (PK) should be set to `None` after a `.delete()` call. This requires modifications in two relevant files: `django/db/models/base.py` for the `Model` class's `delete` method and `django/db/models/deletion.py` for the `Collector` class's `delete` method.\n\nIn `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.delete` method currently does not handle the setting of PK to `None`. This part of the code needs to be updated to set PK to `None` after the deletion process is complete. The specific line to look at would be where the deletion logic is executed.\n\nIn `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `Collector.delete` method manages the actual deletion process for model instances. This is where the actual deletion logic is handled, and thus this part of the code needs to be adjusted to ensure that the PK is set to `None` for each instance after deletion.\n\nBy examining these code spans, it's clear that the `Model.delete` method delegates the deletion process to the `Collector` object but does not handle the post-deletion state of the model instances (like setting the PK to `None`). The `Collector.delete` method, on the other hand, manages the actual deletion and can be modified to include the logic for setting the PK to `None` for each instance. This ensures that the desired outcome is achieved after a successful deletion of model instances.",
