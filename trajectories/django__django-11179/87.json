The issue mentions specifically Django.db.models.deletion lines 276-281, suggesting that the update should occur around line 280. Given this context, the focus should be on the delete method and how it handles the PK for models with no dependencies. Relevant files and methods have been provided in the context, including the Model class in django/db/models/base.py and the Collector class in django/db/models/deletion.py. It's likely that the fix involves modifying how the PK is handled within the delete method in these or related classes.",
