The analysis of the search results reveals that the `Model.delete` method in `django/db/models/base.py` does not currently set the PK to None after deletion. This is a potential area to update. Additionally, the `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py` at line 280 is the place to modify since it handles the actual deletion process and post-deletion operations. Also, the `Collector` class seems to be responsible for managing the deletion of model instances and could be where the PK setting logic should be implemented. The `QuerySet.delete` method in `django/db/models/query.py` is also relevant as it uses the `Collector` class to perform deletions, indicating that any changes to ensure PKs are set to None should be coordinated with how deletions are processed through this method.",
