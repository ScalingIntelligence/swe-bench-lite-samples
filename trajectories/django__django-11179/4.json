The specified lines in `django.db.models.deletion` (276-281) suggest that the problem might lie in the `delete()` method implementation or how the primary key is managed post-deletion. To debug and fix this, we need to focus on the `delete()` method in the `Model` class and the `Collector` class (particularly its `delete()` method), as well as any relevant handling of primary keys in deletion processes. Additionally, examining the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` and its subclasses could provide insights into how the database schema interacts with model deletions.",

Analysing the search results, I found two key locations in the codebase that are relevant to this issue: 1. The `Model.delete` method in `django/db/models/base.py`, which is responsible for initiating the deletion process. This method calls the `Collector.delete` method. 2. The `Collector.delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, which is where the actual deletion logic is implemented. This method currently does not handle the setting of PKs to None after deletion. To address the issue, the PK setting logic needs to be incorporated in the `Collector.delete` method. This would ensure that after successfully deleting a model, its PK is set to None, as required by the reported issue.",
