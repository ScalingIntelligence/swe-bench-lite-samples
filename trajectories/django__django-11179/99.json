This should be investigated in the context of Django's model deletion process. The provided files suggest focusing on the django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/deletion.py files, where the deletion logic and model management are handled. Specifically, the `delete` method in the Model class and the Collector class are relevant. Additionally, the deletion behavior in the QuerySet class within django/db/models/query.py should also be considered, as it handles bulk deletions. The issue indicates a focus on lines 276-281 in django/db/models/deletion.py, which suggests checking the Collector class's delete method for how it handles model deletions and possibly updating the PK setting logic.",
