Specifically, the Primary Key (PK) should be set to None after the delete() call. This requirement indicates a need to examine the delete method and its related context within the Django database models to implement the desired behavior.\n\nThe initial file context provided includes multiple Django core files related to model operations such as base.py, deletion.py, related_descriptors.py, and fields/related.py. The examination should focus on the instances where the delete method is defined or used, particularly in base.py and deletion.py as they are most directly related to model instance deletion and its implications for primary keys.\n\nTo facilitate the resolution, a targeted search within these files for the delete method and its effects on primary keys, including checking if the PK is being set to None after a deletion, will be beneficial. The search should look for explicit handling or lack of handling (in case of an omission) in these contexts.",

However, the specific requirement of setting the Primary Key (PK) to None after deletion is not directly addressed in the provided code snippets. The last lines of the Collector's delete method seem to attempt to set the PK to None for all instances after deletion, but this might not fully meet the requirement if not adequately tested or applied in all relevant contexts.
