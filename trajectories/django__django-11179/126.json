Specifically, it is noted that the primary key (PK) is not being set to None after the .delete() call, which is the expected behavior. The issue references Django.db.models.deletion:276-281 as a starting point for investigation. Given the context, the focus should be on the delete method in the django/db/models/base.py file, as well as any related deletion logic in the django/db/models/deletion.py file.",

These sections provide a complete view of the delete process and how the PK is managed before and after the deletion. Additionally, the get_candidate_relations_to_delete function can help identify any dependencies before proceeding with the deletion. These are crucial parts to consider when determining if the PK should be reset to None after deletion of an instance with no dependencies.
