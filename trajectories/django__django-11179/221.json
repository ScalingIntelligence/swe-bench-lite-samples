The issue specifically mentions line numbers 276-281 in 'Django.db.models.deletion', indicating that the deletion process might not be setting the PK to `None`. The search results include relevant sections from 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. Key spans identified are 'Model.delete' in 'base.py' and 'Collector.delete' in 'deletion.py'. In 'Model.delete', the method collects the instance to be deleted without modifying the PK. In 'Collector.delete', the deletion logic processes the instances, but the PK is not explicitly set to `None` as part of the deletion process. These sections are crucial for addressing the issue, as they include the actual deletion logic and the model class definition, which defines the `delete()` method.",
