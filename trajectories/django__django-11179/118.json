This operational requirement entails checking how the delete() method works in Django's Model class and then looking at the deletion process in the Collector class, which handles the actual deletion and possibly the state management for objects being deleted. Two files from Django's source have been retrieved: 'base.py' and 'deletion.py'. The 'base.py' file contains the implementation of the delete() method for the Model class, which is crucial since it initiates the deletion process by creating an instance of the Collector class. This method seems to be responsible for checking if the Primary Key exists and initializing a deletion collector. Thus, it is the starting point for the fix. On the other hand, in 'deletion.py', there's a more detailed implementationof the deletion process in the Collector class. After mining through the codebase, we observed direct interaction with PKs within the deletion operation. Notably, after raw deletion within the the Collector's delete() method, the options_pk.attname (representing PK) afforded the perfect location service where setting the PK to None is necessary. This method facility orchestrates the actual deletion acts as varable facilitating post therapy on models PK attribute. The changes exhibiting overlap the PK reset required catalyzed resolution to issue.",
