Specifically, it mentions that after calling delete() on a model instance with no dependencies, the primary key (PK) should be set to None. The specific location in the code to be updated is mentioned as Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, line 280. Given the specificity of the issue, targeting the delete() method in the Model class within 'django/db/models/base.py' and the deletion logic in 'django/db/models/deletion.py' is a priority. Additionally, reviewing the primary key handling in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' might be necessary to ensure that PKs are appropriately managed upon deletion.",
