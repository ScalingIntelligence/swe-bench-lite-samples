The search results included files 'django/db/models/deletion.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'. In 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the method 'Collector.delete' is a potential location to implement the change, as it orchestrates the deletion process. It includes a section that iterates over instances and sets their primary keys to None. This section appears relevant for addressing the issue. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the method 'Model.delete' initializes the deletion process, indicating that changes here might also be necessary depending on the identified solution.
