This could potentially affect any deletion process in Django's ORM where models are deleted but their PKs are retained. The search results include code spans from the 'deletion.py' and 'base.py' files under the 'django/db/models' directory, which are relevant as they handle model deletion and primary key setting.\n\nThe 'Collector.delete' method in 'deletion.py' contains key logic for deleting models. It important to observe that the segment where PKs are set to None after deletion marks the end of the deletion process, targeting all instances in the data items for models. This approach confirms to the requirement mentioned in the issue.\n\nAdditionally, there is a 'Model.delete' method in 'base.py', clearly indicating the method used for deleting individual model instances in Django. This also involves initializing a 'Collector' for deletion. Since this method invokes 'Collector.delete' within its execution flow and delves into handling primary key resetting after deletion, this span of code should be acknowledged as pertinent.\n\nBased on the analysis, there are two relevant files identified that potentially contain findings to address the reported issue.",
