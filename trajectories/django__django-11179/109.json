A specific mention is made about Django's deletion logic in django/db/models/deletion.py, lines 276-281, suggesting an update to line 280 in particular.\n\nFrom the search results, two key files are identified: django/db/models/deletion.py and django/db/models/base.py. Both files contain code spans related to deletion and handling primary keys.\n\nIn django/db/models/deletion.py:\n- The delete() method in the Collector class is responsible for managing the deletion process. It sorts instances, sends signals, handles fast deletes, and updates fields before finally deleting instances.\n\nIn django/db/models/base.py:\n- The delete() method in the Model class initializes a Collector and uses it to collect and delete the model instance, handling the database operations related to deletion.\n\nBoth methods are crucial for understanding how model deletion is handled in Django, and they are directly related to the reported issue about PKs not being cleared upon deletion. Specifically, in the delete() method of the Collector, we can see the code setting PKs to None after all deletions are processed (after popping the primary key from self.__dict__), which likely relates to the update needed as per the issue report.",
