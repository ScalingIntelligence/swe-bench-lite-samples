The issue mentions Django's deletion process and suggests looking at django/db/models/deletion.py lines 276-281. Given the complexity and multiple files involved in Django's model management and deletion process, focusing on these lines and the surrounding code in the deletion module is a good starting point. Additionally, examining the delete method in django/db/models/base.py and related methods in other files might help uncover the specific code responsible for handling PK updates upon model deletion.",

Specifically, the `delete()` method in `django/db/models/base.py` demonstrates the process of model deletion and uses the `Collector` class from `django/db/models/deletion.py` to manage cascading deletes and field updates. However, the code concerning the setting of primary keys (PKs) to `None` after a `.delete()` call is not explicitly found in the provided context. The issue mentions lines 276-281 in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, but those lines relate to various deletion strategies like CASCADE, PROTECT, SET, etc., and not directly to the setting of PKs to `None`. Additionally, the `delete()` method in `QuerySet` class of `django/db/models/query.py` orchestrates the deletion of multiple objects, but again, does not explicitly handle PK updates to `None`. The issue seems to require a deeper dive into how Django handles PKs post-deletion if there are no dependencies, which is not fully covered by the provided file context.",

Given the context of Django's deletion mechanisms, we should focus on the `delete` methods and mechanisms in the provided file context. Specifically, we need to look into how the post-deletion state of the model instance is managed, especially concerning the primary keys. The `delete` method in `django/db/models/base.py` collects the instance to be deleted and uses a `Collector` to handle the deletion. However, the context provided does not explicitly show where or how the primary key is set to None after deletion. It is possible that this logic might be more deeply integrated within the `Collector` class or in other related modules not directly included in the file context. Since the key part of the operation revolves around the deletion and the handling of dependent objects, it's crucial to trace back where and how the primary keys are addressed during this process.",
