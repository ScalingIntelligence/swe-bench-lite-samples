I need to find and understand the relevant parts of the Django code that handle the deletion of model instances to identify where the PKs should ideally be set to None. The search results include code from 'django/db/models/deletion.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'. In 'django/db/models/deletion.py', the 'delete' method of the 'Collector' class (span: Collector.delete) seems to be the place where the deletion logic is handled for multiple instances at once, but it does not seem to directly address the issue of clearing PKs. In 'django/db/models/base.py', the 'delete' method of the 'Model' class (span: Model.delete) implements the deletion logic for a single instance and calls the 'Collector.delete' method. This method does not directly mention clearing PKs either. Given the issue's reference to Django.db.models.deletion:276-281, the relevant part seems to be 'Collector.delete', which is indeed found in the search results at the specified lines, but it doesn't mention setting PKs to None there. The search results do not immediately reveal the exact piece of code that should be modified to set PKs to None after deletion. Further research or context might be needed to pinpoint the exact location for the change, but based on the initial search, focusing on 'Collector.delete' would be the logical starting point.",
