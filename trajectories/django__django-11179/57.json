Specifically, deleting a model instance with no dependencies should set its primary key (PK) to None. The problem potentially lies in the handling of the delete method within the django/db/models/base.py or django/db/models/deletion.py files. To address this, we should focus on the delete method in these files and possibly look for lines around 276-281 in the deletion module as indicated by the issue description.",

The issue suggests that the PK should be set to None after deletion, which aligns with the section in the delete method where PKs are set to None after deletion completes.
