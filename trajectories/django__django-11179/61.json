The references provided from the reported issue suggest examining specific sections of the Django codebase related to model deletion and PK management. From the search results, it's evident that the `django/db/models/base.py` file contains the `Model.delete()` method and related properties like `_get_pk_val` and `_set_pk_val`, which are crucial for managing the PK. The `django/db/models/deletion.py` file also contains the `Collector.delete()` method, responsible for managing deletion in related models. The `django/db/models/query.py` file includes the `QuerySet.delete()` method, which orchestrates the deletion of objects from the database. These code spans are relevant because they provide the foundational logic for model deletion and PK management. The provided spans outline crucial aspects of model deletion and PK handling, which should be carefully inspected and updated to align with the reported issue's requirements, ensuring that the PK is set to `None` post deletion.",
