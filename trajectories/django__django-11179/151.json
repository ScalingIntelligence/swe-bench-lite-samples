The search results provide context in three main files: django/db/models/base.py, django/db/models/deletion.py, and django/db/models/fields/files.py.\n\nIn django/db/models/base.py, the `Model.delete` method exists but does not handle the setting of the PK to None post-deletion. This is the primary area of concern as it involves the base functionality of model deletion.\n\nIn django/db/models/deletion.py, the `Collector.delete` method is a critical part of the deletion process. This method sorts and deletes instances and updates fields. However, it also does not explicitly set the PK to None, which aligns with the issue description.\n\nIn django/db/models/fields/files.py, the `FieldFile.delete` and `ImageFieldFile.delete` methods handle file deletion but are not directly relevant to the setting of model PKs to None.\n\nGiven these findings, the focus should be on editing the `Model.delete` method in django/db/models/base.py and the `Collector.delete` method in django/db/models/deletion.py to include a call that sets the PK to None for models without dependencies after deletion.",
