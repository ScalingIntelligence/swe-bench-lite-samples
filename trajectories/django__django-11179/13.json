The issue specifically mentions a line in 'django.db.models.deletion' which should be updated.\n\nIn the provided search results, two main files are relevant: 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/deletion.py'. The first file contains the base model class and its methods, including the 'delete' method. The second file contains the 'Collector' class which is used by the 'delete' method to manage and execute deletions.\n\nThe 'Model.delete' method in 'base.py' calls the 'collect' method on a 'Collector' instance, which then handles the actual deletion. The 'Collector.delete' method performs the deletion and sends pre_delete and post_delete signals, but it does not currently set the primary key to None after deletion.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the necessary fix involves modifying the 'Collector.delete' method to set the primary key to None for each deleted instance after the deletion operation. This aligns with the identification of the relevant part of the code that needs to be updated and ensures that the primary key is cleared after deletion.",
