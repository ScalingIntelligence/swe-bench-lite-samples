This should be addressed by modifying the `delete` method in the `Model` class or the `delete` method in the `Collector` class.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are identified as follows:\n1. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model.delete` method is found, which calls the `Collector`'s `delete` method.\n2. In `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the `Collector.delete` method is found, which performs the actual deletion process and currently does not set the primary key to `None` after deletion.\n\nThe immediate step should be to review these methods and determine if setting the primary key to `None` can be safely implemented without breaking other functionalities. For now, I will identify the relevant code spans that need further review or modification to address the issue.",
