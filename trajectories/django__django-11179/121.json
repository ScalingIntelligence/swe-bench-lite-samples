I need to identify and analyze the code spans related to model deletion and the handling of primary keys. From the search results, I see that the `delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py` is relevant as it deals with the deletion of model instances. Specifically, the `Collector.delete` method performs the actual deletion and handling of related objects. It should be checked if this method already handles setting the PK to None for models without dependencies. Additionally, the `Model.delete` method in `django/db/models/base.py` is also relevant as it uses the `Collector` to delete the model instance. The search results also include other implementations of `delete` in different parts of Django, such as `QuerySet.delete` in `django/db/models/query.py`, which may indirectly affect how the PK is handled post-deletion. These sections need to be reviewed to ensure the PK handling after deletion is consistent and correctly implemented across different components of Django.",
