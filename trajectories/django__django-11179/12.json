The hint points to the Django.db.models.deletion module, specifically lines 276-281. From the provided context, it's evident that methods related to deletion, such as delete() in the Model class and Collector class, need to be examined. The delete() method in the QuerySet class, as well as the underlying delete logic in the deletion module, are crucial for understanding how deletion works. Additionally, the ForeignKey class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' has a deconstruct method, which might be related to how objects are handled during deletion. Focusing on these areas will help identify where the PK update logic might be missing or needs adjustment.",

By closely examining the provided search results, particularly the 'django/db/models/deletion.py' file, I identified the `Collector.delete()` method which handles the deletion logic, including a loop that goes through `self.data.items()` and sets the primary key attribute (`model._meta.pk.attname`) to `None` for each instance after deletion. This specific logic aligns perfectly with the requirement to update the PK to `None` after deleting instances without dependencies. Additionally, in 'django/db/models/base.py', the `Model.delete()` method calls `Collector.collect()` to gather the instances for deletion, which further supports the relevance of the identified code spans to the reported issue. Given these matches, the necessary code for addressing the reported issue appears to be present and correctly implemented, indicating that the search results provide the needed context for the task at hand.",
