        "message": "The `delete()` method in the `Collector` class within `django/db/models/deletion.py` is responsible for handling the deletion process of model instances. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the method does not explicitly set the primary key (PK) of the deleted instances to `None`. This behavior is expected as part of the deletion process, ensuring that the deleted instances are properly marked as non-existent in the database. Nevertheless, it is crucial to ensure that the primary keys are indeed cleared or set to `None` after the deletion process to reflect the state accurately in the application. Within the `delete()` method, the logic to send `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals is present, but there is no explicit code segment that sets the PK to `None`. However, the last loop in the method that iterates over `self.data` and `instances` suggests a place where such an update could be integrated. Specifically, after the deletion counter updates, the method could be amended to set the PK to `None` for each instance. Additionally, it's worthwhile to consider that the `delete()` method of individual model instances might also require adjustments, especially considering the `collector.delete()` call within the `Model` class's `delete()` method. The current context does not show any nested helper functions within `Collector` dedicated to setting PKs to `None` post-deletion directly, and the responsibility for handling this update might be shouldered by the main `delete()` function itself.",
