The issue references Django's `django.db.models.deletion` module and specifies lines 276-281, suggesting there's a specific part of the deletion process that needs updating. From the search results, it's evident that the relevant files are `django/db/models/deletion.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`. The `Collector` class in `deletion.py` seems to handle the actual deletion logic, including sending pre_delete and post_delete signals and managing how instances are deleted. The `Model.delete` method in `base.py` sets up and uses the `Collector` to handle the deletion of instances. However, the current implementation does not explicitly set the PK to None after deletion. Based on the issue details and search results, the relevant code spans to address the issue are in the `Collector.delete()` method in `deletion.py`, specifically where post-deletion operations take place. Ensuring that the primary key is set to None post-deletion involves looking at where model instances are handled after deletion in the `Collector` class.",
