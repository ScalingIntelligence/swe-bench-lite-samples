Specifically, the primary key (PK) is not being set to `None` after a `.delete()` call, as it should. Given the hint in the issue ('See Django.db.models.deletion:276-281'), the focus is on the `deletion` module within `django.db.models`. The primary candidates for inspection are the `delete()` method defined in `base.py` and potentially the `delete()` method within the `Collector` class in `deletion.py`, as well as any related logic in `related_descriptors.py` and `related.py` that might affect how primary keys are handled during deletions.",

The issue refers to Django's model API and specifically points out the `Model.delete()` method and its relation to the `django.db.models.deletion` module. The current search results provide several relevant code spans from the `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/deletion.py` files. The most relevant spans include the definition of the `Model.delete()` method, which triggers the `Collector` to collect and delete the instance, and the `Collector.delete()` method, which handles the actual deletion process. Notably, the current implementation does not include setting the PK to None after deletion. Therefore, the relevant spans are those involved in the deletion process and where we may need to add logic for setting the PK to None. These spans include `Model.delete()`, `Collector.delete()`, and possibly the `_set_pk_val` method within `Model`. Analyzing the entire process of deletion from `Model.delete()` to `Collector.delete()` suggests where the modification should take place.",

The `Collector` class's `delete()` method does indeed handle the deletion process and could potentially be the place where the PK should be updated to `None` post-deletion. The issue also refers to 'django.db.models.deletion:276-281', which aligns with the code provided in `deletion.py`. This strongly suggests that the provided context includes the necessary code for addressing the issue. However, the exact line mentioned in the issue (line 280 in `deletion.py`) does not currently set the PK to `None` after a deletion.
