The expected behavior is that empty arrays should be returned regardless of the datatypes used to fit the LabelEncoder. The issue is evident from the provided code snippet where transforming an empty list after fitting with numerical values works, but it fails after fitting with string values. This indicates a potential bug related to datatype handling in the transform method.\n\nThe search results include the implementation of the LabelEncoder class and its transform method. The transform method is crucial as it directly handles the transformation of input data after the LabelEncoder has been fit. The method calls np.searchsorted on the classes_ attribute with the input y. The issue might be linked to how the datatypes of y and self.classes_ are aligned or handled during this search operation, especially when y is an empty list.\n\nThe relevant code spans are those directly involved in the transform method and any helper methods it uses, such as check_is_fitted, column_or_1d, and np.searchsorted.
