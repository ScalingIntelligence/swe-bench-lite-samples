The entire LabelEncoder class definition, as it contains the methods fit, transform, and inverse_transform which are directly related to the issue.\n2. The transform method of the LabelEncoder class is particularly relevant as it is where the failure occurs when dealing with empty lists.\n\nThe transform method contains the code `return np.searchsorted(self.classes_, y)` which is likely causing the TypeError described in the issue. This indicates that the dtype of `self.classes_` and `y` might not align when `y` is an empty list, leading to the error.\n\nThe fit method is also relevant as it sets up the `self.classes_` attribute, which is used in the transform method. Understanding how `self.classes_` is set and its dtype is crucial for addressing the issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are sufficient to address the issue as they cover the relevant methods and attributes involved in the failure.",

The current context provided already includes relevant code spans from the LabelEncoder class, such as the fit and transform methods. However, the transform method's handling of empty lists could potentially benefit from more nuanced dtype handling to prevent exceptions. The search results provided additional utility functions from sklearn.utils that might be useful for enhancing the transform method's handling of different dtypes, especially in handling empty inputs. Particularly, the check_array function in sklearn.utils.validation could be useful for preprocessing the input before it is passed to np.searchsorted, ensuring that the input's dtype is consistent and safe for the operation. This function validates and potentially reshapes the input array, which could prevent the dtype-related exceptions mentioned in the issue. Therefore, integrating this function into the transform method could be a solution. The column_or_1d function in the same module could also be relevant, ensuring that the input is a 1D array, which is expected by the LabelEncoder's methods.",
