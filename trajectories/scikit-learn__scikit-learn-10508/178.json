From the provided traceback, it's evident that the transformation fails when the LabelEncoder has been fit with string labels, which is different from the behavior observed when it has been fit with integer labels. This difference suggests an underlying issue related to the datatype handling. Upon reviewing the search results, the relevant file is 'sklearn/preprocessing/label.py', and specifically, the 'transform' method of the 'LabelEncoder' class is highly relevant. This method is responsible for transforming the input data based on previously fit labels. The current implementation raises a ValueError if new labels are encountered during transformation but does not handle the case of empty lists differently based on the fit data type. Therefore, this method is the likely source of the issue, and further investigation or modification here should resolve the problem described.",
