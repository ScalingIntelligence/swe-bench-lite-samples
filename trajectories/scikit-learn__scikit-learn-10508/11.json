The expected behavior is for the method to return empty arrays regardless of the data types used for fitting. However, a TypeError is thrown when the LabelEncoder is previously fit with strings. To address this issue, it's crucial to pinpoint the implementation of the transform method and the handling of different data types within the LabelEncoder class. Also, it's important to review how data types are being managed and cast within the context of an empty list transformation.",

The issue specifically mentions that when using string inputs for fitting (like ['a', 'b']), transforming an empty list throws a `TypeError`. This suggests that the `LabelEncoder` class or the `transform` method might need adjustments to handle different data types more gracefully, specifically, ensuring that empty arrays are returned regardless of the data type used during fitting.\n\nBy examining the provided search results, I can see that the LabelEncoder class and its `transform` method are defined under 'sklearn/preprocessing/label.py'. This file seems to include the `LabelEncoder` class and the `transform` method that is likely causing the error because it uses the `np.searchsorted` function, which could be problematic for different data types. The error traceback provided by the user also indicates that the error occurs within this `transform` method.\n\nGiven this context, I recommend focusing on the `transform` method within this class to address the issue by ensuring that it can handle empty lists regardless of the data type used during fitting.
