The expected behavior is that empty arrays should be returned regardless of the datatype used in fitting. The provided code demonstration from the user shows that LabelEncoder behaves correctly when fitting with numerical values but fails when fitting with string values. This discrepancy arises in the transform method when dealing with empty arrays. The relevant code snippet provided in the search results clearly shows the transform method of the LabelEncoder class where the main transformation logic resides. This method checks if the object has been fitted, processes the input y to ensure it's a 1D array, and then uses np.searchsorted to find the indices corresponding to the labels in y. The exception handling in the user's traceback suggests that the discrepancy in behavior is likely due to the internal handling of datatypes by numpy's searchsorted method when dealing with empty arrays, especially when the datatypes in fit and transform differ. The provided span fully encapsulates the logic at the root of the issue and is thus highly relevant to the reported problem.",

The traceback in the issue indicates that the failure occurs during the np.searchsorted call, which seems to mishandle the dtype mismatch between the input data (float64) and the expected data type (<U32).\n\nAn examination of the updated file context in sklearn/preprocessing/label.py shows that the LabelEncoder class definition and its methods (fit, fit_transform, transform, and inverse_transform) are correctly included. The transform method in particular is relevant as it uses np.searchsorted. The current implementation checks if the input y is fitted (check_is_fitted) and then calls np.unique on y and compares it with the self.classes_ to ensure consistency before using np.searchsorted. This suggests that the error arises because of the dtype difference leading to data casting issues when np.searchsorted is executed on empty lists.\n\nGiven this analysis, the code spans directly related to the LabelEncoder's transform method are the most relevant for addressing the reported issue.",
