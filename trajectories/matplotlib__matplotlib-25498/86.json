The error messages and the provided example suggest that the current methods for updating the colorbar, such as `update_normal` and `update_bruteforce`, are not working as expected. Specifically, `update_normal` has no effect, and `update_bruteforce` throws a `ZeroDivisionError`. Given this context, the search should focus on the `colorbar.py` file within Matplotlib's library to find relevant code spans and potentially identify alternative or undocumented methods for updating the colorbar after modifying the norm instance.",
