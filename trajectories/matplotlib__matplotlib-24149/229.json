The provided error traceback points to a potential problem in the `Axes._convert_dx` method within the `Axes.bar` function. To investigate this, it's crucial to focus on the `axes/_axes.py` file, as this is where the `Axes` class and its `bar` method are defined. Additionally, the mention of a specific code snippet (`engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)`) implies that the issue might be related to data handling or NaN value processing. Therefore, this search will focus on the `axes/_axes.py` file to find relevant code spans within the `Axes.bar` method and related functions.",

The code spans provided include the `Axes.hist` method, which could also be relevant if the issue affects histograms as well. The analysis of the provided code suggests that the `Axes.bar` method may need to handle cases where only nan data is provided, potentially by ensuring that the first finite value is correctly handled to avoid a `StopIteration` exception. Further investigation into the `_safe_first_finite` function and how it interacts with the `Axes.bar` method is warranted to determine a fix.

The file context primarily focuses on the 'hist' method, which indirectly relates to histogram functionality, a close relative of bar plots.

However, without seeing the specific implementation of 'ax.bar' and its utility methods in the given context, I cannot verify if all necessary code spans are included to address the issue. A deeper investigation into the 'ax.bar' method and its dependencies in the 'axes/_axes.py' file is needed.",
