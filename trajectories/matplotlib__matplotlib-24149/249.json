The provided file context and search results from `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` are examined. The file is a core part of the matplotlib library containing the Axes class which includes the `bar` method and a static method `_convert_dx`. Analyzing these sections, the `Axes._convert_dx` method attempts to handle NaN values by using `cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)` and `cbook._safe_first_finite(xconv)` within a try block to manipulate the inputs and denominators. If empty arrays are encountered (which would be the case with NaN inputs), the methods fail as shown in the repro code. The `Axes.bar` method calls `self._convert_dx` for width and height adjustments, suggesting a strong correlation with the reported issue as the core logic involves processing and adjusting bar plot dimensions.
