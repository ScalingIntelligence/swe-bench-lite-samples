The issue specifically mentions that `ax.bar` raises an exception when passed only NaN data, and it is related to the handling of NaN values in the 'x' positions or heights of the bars. By analyzing the provided 'Axes.bar' implementation, we can pinpoint the code spans responsible for handling the 'x' positions, which is most likely where the error occurs. The relevant code spans to investigate would be those dealing with the conversion of 'x' and 'width' values since the exception traceback points to 'convert_xunits' and '_convert_dx' functions. Looking at the 'width = self._convert_dx(width, x0, x, self.convert_xunits)' line and following that up to 'x0 = cbook._safe_first_finite(x0)', we can see that the 'x0' values, which should be the original 'x' values passed to 'ax.bar', are being processed to ensure proper handling. This suggests that the portion of the code involving 'Axes._convert_dx' and 'cbook._safe_first_finite' could be critical to understanding and fixing the issue with NaN values. We should also consider the lines immediately before and after this snippet to have a complete context of how NaN values might be handled or mishandled in version 3.6.1 of matplotlib specifically related to 'ax.bar' function and its interacting subfunctions dash '_convert_dx',convert_xunits', '_safe_first_finite' and any related data preprocessing operations.\\n Combining these findings, the collection of code spans from 'Axes.bar' method till one breadth search around '_convert_dx', '_safe_first_finite' functions and their immediate context would be captured for better resolution of NaN valued scenarios in '-bar plot' stack.",
