            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is related to the `ax.bar` function raising an exception when given only NaN data in Matplotlib 3.6.1. This seems to be a regression or change in behavior from 3.6.0, where it would return a `BarCollection` with one Rectangle having NaN for `x` and `height`. The issue seems to be specifically related to the handling of NaN values in the `x` position. From the traceback, it's clear that the exception is occurring in the `_convert_dx` method, which tries to handle the width and positioning of the bars. The code spans provided include the `Axes.bar` method and the `Axes._convert_dx` method. The `Axes.bar` method is the main function where the `ax.bar` call ends up, and it uses `_convert_dx` to handle the width. These code spans seem relevant as they directly address the function in question and the method where the exception occurs. However, since the issue involves handling NaN values, it's crucial to also consider how these values are processed in `_convert_dx`. The current code in `_convert_dx` attempts to find the first finite value in `x0` and `xconv`, which is likely where the StopIteration is being raised because all values are NaN, and thus no finite value can be found. This aligns with the reported issue's focus on NaN handling specifically in the `x` position.",
