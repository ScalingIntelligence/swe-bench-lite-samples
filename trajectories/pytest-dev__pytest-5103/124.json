Specifically, the `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` method in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` is responsible for rewriting assert statements, and it currently handles the transformation of assert statements into a form that includes detailed failure messaging. The search results also include methods such as `visit_BoolOp`, `visit_UnaryOp`, `visit_BinOp`, and others in the `AssertionRewriter` class, which are involved in the rewriting process.
