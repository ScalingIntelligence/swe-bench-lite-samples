The example provided shows the lack of useful failure messages when using generator expressions and list comprehensions compared to a for loop. The suggested solution is to have the assertion re-writer 'unroll' the iterator to mimic the for loop's detailed failure report.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, the key file of interest appears to be `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, which contains the `AssertionRewriter` class responsible for rewriting assertions. Specifically, the `visit_BoolOp` method is relevant as it deals with boolean operations that include `all`/`any` functions. This method could be modified to 'unroll' iterators and provide more detailed failure messages. The other file `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` contains utility functions for assertion operations, specifically `assertrepr_compare` which formats comparison explanations.\n\nAdditionally, the `doc/en/example/assertion/failure_demo.py` file provides examples of failing tests and can be used to validate the effectiveness of any changes made to the assertion rewriting process.",
