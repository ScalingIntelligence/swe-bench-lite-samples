Specifically, the `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp` methods are relevant to the issue at hand. The `visit_Assert` method handles the rewriting of `assert` statements, while the `visit_BoolOp` method deals with boolean operations. The focus should now shift to understanding how these methods handle generator expressions and list comprehensions. The goal is to determine how to enhance the handling of such iterables to provide more detailed failure reports, similar to a for loop. This may involve modifying how iterables are processed within these methods or adding additional helper functions to manage the unrolling and reporting of iterables.",

The issue concerns enhancing the failure messages for `all`/`any` calls by 'unrolling' the iterable, making the error messages more meaningful. The `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp` methods are critical as they handle the rewriting of assert statements and boolean operations, respectively. These methods need to be examined to understand how they currently handle and rewrite these operations and to identify potential places for improvement. Subsequently, we should assess if there are other methods (like `run` or `is_rewrite_disabled`) that could indirectly influence how assert messages are processed or displayed.\n\nOur analysis of the provided code spans reveals detailed handling of assert statements and boolean operations within the `AssertionRewriter` class, precisely where we need to focus. Specifically, the `visit_Assert` method showcases how assert statements are transformed, which is crucial for understanding how to improve the error reporting. The `visit_BoolOp` method deals with boolean operations and could be a key area for refining the 'unrolling' of iterables.\n\nThe `run` method, while not directly modifying assert messages, is responsible for executing the rewriter on a module and could provide broader context on when and where these methods are applied. This context could be beneficial in understanding the full scope of changes needed. Additionally, considering the existing structure and additional code detailing auxiliary functions like `variable`, `assign`, and helper methods, we can infer how the rewriter maintains state and performs complex transformations.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans clearly revolve around the `AssertionRewriter` class's methods, specifically where assert and boolean operations are handled. Therefore, the task of identifying relevant code spans is complete, as we have precisely located where the changes would be applied to address the reported issue.",
