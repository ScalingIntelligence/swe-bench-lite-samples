The example provided shows that the failure messages for these functions are not as informative as they could be compared to the for loop method. The goal is to enhance the assertion rewriter to 'unroll' the iterator, improving the failure messages to be more like the detailed output of the for loop.\n\nThe search results from `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` contain the `AssertionRewriter` class, which seems to be responsible for rewriting assertion statements to provide better error messages. This class has methods that handle different types of AST nodes, such as `visit_Assert`, `visit_BoolOp`, `visit_Name`, and more. These methods appear to be involved in transforming the AST to generate more informative error messages.\n\nWithin the `AssertionRewriter` class, the `visit_Assert` method is of particular interest. This method processes the `assert` statements and constructs the error messages. It includes logic to handle different types of assertions and generate more detailed error messages. The method uses helper methods like `helper`, `display`, and `assign` to build the explanation message for assertion failures.\n\nGiven the user's request for better reporting of `all` and `any` when using assertions, the relevant parts of the code are methods within the `AssertionRewriter` class that handle these scenarios. Specifically, the `visit_BoolOp` method would be important for handling the case where `all` or `any` is used within an assertion, as it processes boolean operations. Additionally, the `visit_Assert` method itself, as it controls how assertions are transformed, should be considered.\n\nConsidering the search results and the issue at hand, it appears that the identified code spans could potentially be used to implement the requested feature. The implementation would likely require modifying the existing logic in `visit_BoolOp` and `visit_Assert` to better handle iterables within `all` and `any` functions, unrolling them to produce more detailed and useful error messages.",
