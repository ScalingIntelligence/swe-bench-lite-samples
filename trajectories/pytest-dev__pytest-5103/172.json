Specifically, the `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` seems relevant, as it handles the rewriting of assert statements. The `visit_Assert` method is of particular interest, as it processes individual assert statements and could potentially be modified to unroll iterables for better reporting. Similarly, the `visit_BoolOp` method, which handles boolean operations within assert statements, might also need adjustments to support this enhancement. The identification of these methods and the broader context within the `AssertionRewriter` class indicates a strong starting point for addressing the issue.",
