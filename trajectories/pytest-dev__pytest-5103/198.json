The relevant files identified from the context include src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py, src/_pytest/assertion/util.py, and src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py. These files are likely to contain the assertion rewriter logic and utility functions used for generating assertion messages. Since the problem involves the failure messages for `all`/`any` calls, the focus should be on the `AssertionRewriter` class and the functions related to handling boolean operations in the assertion rewriter module. Additionally, looking for functions or methods that handle iterable unrolling or detailed assertion messages could be beneficial.",

The current implementation of the `AssertionRewriter` in the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file is relevant to this issue as it handles the re-writing of assertions to provide better debug information. The `visit_Assert` method is particularly important as it deals with transforming `assert` statements to include more detailed failure messages. Additionally, the `visit_BoolOp` method is relevant for handling boolean operations within assertions, which includes `all` and `any` functions. Furthermore, the `visit_Name`, `visit_Call_35`, `visit_Call_legacy`, and `visit_Compare` methods are related to handling specific types of expressions and calls within the assertions, which could be relevant for unrolling the iterator and providing more detailed failure messages. The rest of the methods within the `AssertionRewriter` class contribute to the context in which these transformations are made, ensuring that the re-written assertions function correctly and provide the necessary debug information upon failure.",
