The current failure messages aren't useful because they don't unroll the iterable in the assertion, whereas a for loop would provide a more meaningful report. \n\nThe search results provide relevant code spans in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`. Specifically, within `rewrite.py`, the `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` method and `AssertionRewriter.visit_BoolOp` method are relevant as they handle the rewriting of assert statements and boolean operations, respectively. These methods can be modified to better unroll the iterable and provide more detailed failure messages. \n\nIn `util.py`, various helper functions like `assertrepr_compare`, `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, `_compare_eq_cls`, and `_notin_text` are provided for generating detailed and verbose comparison explanations. These functions can use to enhance the failure messages by comparing and diffing elements of the iterables, which is essential for improvements in reporting on `all`/`any` assertions. \n\nFrom the provided search results, it appears that the existing codebase is equipped with the necessary components for modifying the assertion rewriter(possibly by updating `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp` functions), maintaining context, and generating better failure messages at relevant places (where essentially thorough explanations for inconsistent elements are needed as in helper functions mentioned).\n\nOverall, based on the detailed analysis, the relevant code spans aligned with the reported issue have been identified and are included below.",
