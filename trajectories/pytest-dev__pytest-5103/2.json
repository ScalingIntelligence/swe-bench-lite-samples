The provided search results contain relevant code spans in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` that handle the rewriting of assertions, including the `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp` methods in the `AssertionRewriter` class. These methods are involved in the transformation of assert statements to provide more informative failure messages. Specifically, `visit_Assert` processes assert statements and includes logic to handle different forms of assertions, while `visit_BoolOp` deals with boolean operations within assertions. The utility functions in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` such as `assertrepr_compare` and related functions are also relevant as they generate detailed comparison explanations, which could be leveraged to enhance the failure messages for `all`/`any` calls. Overall, the identified code spans are directly related to the assertion rewriting and comparison explanation functionalities, which are key to addressing the issue.",
