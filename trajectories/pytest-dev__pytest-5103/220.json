The user suggests that the assertion rewriter should 'unroll' the iterator to provide more detailed failure reports, similar to how a for loop would work but without the verbosity. This indicates that the relevant code to look for involves how the assertion rewriter handles these iterable inputs and possibly transforms them into a more detailed format for error reporting. In the provided search results, the `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` contains methods that seem to handle boolean operations (like `all` and `any`) and might be involved in generating failure messages. Specifically, the `visit_BoolOp` method processes boolean operations and constructs detailed explanations for failures, which aligns with the needs expressed in the issue. This method iterates over the boolean operation values, building up a detailed explanation for each value, which suggests it's involved in the kind of 'unrolling' behavior the user desires for better error messages. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those within the `visit_BoolOp` method, as they directly deal with transforming boolean operations into more verbose failure reports.",
