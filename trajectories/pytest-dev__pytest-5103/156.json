The provided search results include several relevant files and code spans, particularly from `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py`, `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, and `doc/en/example/assertion/failure_demo.py`. In `rewrite.py`, the `AssertionRewritingHook` class and its methods, such as `__init__`, `_should_rewrite`, and `visit_BoolOp`, are crucial for understanding how assertion rewriting works. The `AssertionRewriter` class and its `visit_BoolOp` and `visit_Compare` methods also handle the rewriting of boolean operations and comparisons. The util.py file contains helper functions like `assertrepr_compare`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, and `_notin_text`, which are used for creating detailed comparison explanations. Additionally, the `failure_demo.py` file provides practical examples demonstrating different assertion failures and their corresponding output. By examining these specific parts of the codebase, we can understand how assertions are currently rewritten and handled, which is crucial for implementing the proposed 'unrolling' of iterators to improve failure messages.",
