The `AssertionRewriter` class is responsible for rewriting assert statements to provide more informative failure messages. The `assertrepr_compare` function generates detailed comparison explanations, which are essential for understanding the failures in `all`/`any` calls. The function `_compare_eq_iterable` within `assertrepr_compare` deals specifically with comparing iterable objects, which aligns directly with the issue of needing better reports for iterable checks in `all`/`any` calls. This function should be carefully reviewed and potentially improved to provide more detailed and useful failure messages when asserting on iterable objects. No further code context is necessary as the identified spans already address the core of the issue.",
