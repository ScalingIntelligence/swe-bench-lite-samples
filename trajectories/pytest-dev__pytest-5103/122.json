Specifically, the user wants to 'unroll' the iterable in such calls to provide more detailed failure reports. The provided file context and search results are from the `rewrite.py` module of pytest, which is responsible for rewriting assertions to provide better failure messages. The search results contain several key functions and methods within the `AssertionRewriter` class that are likely involved in handling assertions, including `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp`. These methods are directly related to processing assert statements and boolean operations, which are pivotal for addressing the issue. The `visit_Assert` method handles the rewriting of assert statements, and within this method, the creation of more detailed failure messages is setup. Similarly, the `visit_BoolOp` method deals with boolean operations, which are relevant for `all`/`any` calls as mentioned in the issue. Both methods are critical for implementing the proposed enhancement of 'unrolling' iterables. Thus, these sections of code are highly relevant to the reported issue.",

I've examined the provided code spans within the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods. The class is responsible for rewriting assertions to provide better error messages. The `visit_Assert` method is the main location where the AST of assertions is processed, and it constructs a detailed report when an assertion fails. Notably, the current implementation does not explicitly handle the 'unrolling' of iterables within `all`/`any` calls. To address the issue, we would likely need to enhance the `visit_Assert` method to identify and handle the 'unrolling' process for such calls. The related methods and spans in the `AssertionRewriter` class can provide a foundation to extend this functionality.
