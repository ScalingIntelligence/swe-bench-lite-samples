This involves modifying the `visit_BoolOp` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class to include detailed explanations for each element in the iterable.\n\nIn the search results from `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, several functions handle the comparison and explanation of differing elements. These functions, such as `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls`, offer detailed comparisons for different types of objects. These functions could be leveraged within the `AssertionRewriter` class to provide more detailed failure messages when handling `all` and `any` operations.\n\nThe identified relevant spans in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` are `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls`.
