The current problem is that when using these functions in an assert statement, the failure message does not provide specific details about which element caused the failure. The proposed solution is to 'unroll' the iterator in these assertions to provide more meaningful error messages, similar to what a for loop would provide. Given the nature of the problem, I should focus my search on the pytest assertion rewriting and utility functions, particularly those related to handling assert statements and generating failure messages.",

The primary concern is that the current failure messages don't provide enough detail, unlike the for-loop approach which offers specific failure points. The proposed solution is to 'unroll' these iterables within the assertions to provide more specific failure reports, akin to how a for-loop would handle it.\n\nIn analyzing the provided search results, the focus is on the `AssertionRewriter` class within `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. This class appears to be responsible for rewriting assertions, particularly in the `visit_BoolOp` method, which handles boolean operations including `all`/`any`. The method contains logic to iterate through boolean operation values and handle failure contexts, suggesting it's directly involved in processing assertion failures.\n\nBased on the issue description and the discovered code, the `visit_BoolOp` method is likely the key area to modify or extend in order to 'unroll' iterables and improve error reporting for `all`/`any` calls. Identifying and processing each value in the iterable within this context could lead to more detailed failure messages, as proposed in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code span identified is the `visit_BoolOp` method within the `AssertionRewriter` class.",
