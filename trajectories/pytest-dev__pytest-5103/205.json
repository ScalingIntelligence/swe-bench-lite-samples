The goal is to make these failure messages more informative by unrolling the iterable, akin to the behavior of a for loop. Given the nature of the problem, it's likely that the solution lies within the assertion rewriter of pytest. Key files to focus on are those related to assertion rewriting, specifically `rewrite.py` and `util.py`, which handle the AST rewriting and utility functions for assertions, respectively. The search should focus on these files to locate functions or classes that handle the rewriting of assertions involving `all` and `any` operations.",

The primary objective is to enhance the reporting mechanism to make it more informative, similar to how a detailed loop-based assertion works. Observing the provided code spans, several segments stand out as potentially relevant to addressing this issue:\n\n1. **AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert**: This method is central to the assertion rewriting process and is likely to hold essential logic for handling assertion failures. Specifically, the handling mechanisms for different types of nodes within the assert statement could provide an interface for customizing failure reports based on the type of expression.\n\n2. **Utilities for string and collection comparisons** in `util.py` (like `_compare_eq_sequence` and `_compare_eq_iterable`), which provide detailed diffs and reports when collections or strings are involved in comparisons, suggesting methods already in place for precise failure descriptions.\n\n3. **Specific handling of comparison operators and boolean operations** in `AssertionRewriter.visit_Compare` and `AssertionRewriter.visit_BoolOp`, which directly deal with expressions that use `all`/`any`. Enhancing these methods to unroll iterables and generate more descriptive error messages could directly address the issue.\n\nThese sections appear to be the most promising for integrating enhancements that unroll iterables in `all`/`any` assertions, thereby improving clarity in failure reports. Further analysis within these sections will likely unearth the necessary hooks or functionalities to implement the desired feature.",

Additionally, the file context includes utility functions like `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, and `_compare_eq_dict` which are likely to be involved in generating detailed comparison explanations for iterable, sequence, and set comparisons. These utility functions are referenced within the `assertrepr_compare` function, indicating their importance in the assertion rewriting process.
