In `visit_BoolOp`, there's a loop over `boolop.values` which represents the expressions being evaluated by `all`/`any`. Enhancing this loop to check the type of each expression and, if it's a generator or list comprehension, capturing each element could allow for more detailed reporting. This might involve adding new variables to store these elements and appending them to failure explanations. In `visit_Assert`, adjustments would be needed to incorporate these detailed explanations. This could mean modifying the `assertmsg` and `explanation` variables to include the details from the unrolled iterator. Additional helper functions may be necessary to format these details.",
