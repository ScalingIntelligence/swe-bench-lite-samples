The goal is to make the failure reports more meaningful by 'unrolling' the iterator and using existing reports. From the provided context, relevant files and functions like `AssertionRewriter`, `visit_BoolOp`, `visit_Assert` in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, and `assertrepr_compare` in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` seem pivotal. These could be starting points to find the exact locations where modifications need to be made to achieve the desired functionality.",

The failure messages should be as informative as those generated by a loop, but without the verbosity. The issue mentions that the assertion re-writer should 'unroll' the iterator to the third form, similar to a loop, to utilize existing reports. This suggests a need for improving the message generation process in pytest's assertion rewriting and utility functions. Looking at the search results, several functions in `util.py` and `rewrite.py` could be relevant for implementing this improvement. The function `_compare_eq_iterable` and related functions (`_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`) in `util.py` seem to be directly involved in comparing iterable types and could be where the 'unrolling' logic should be added. Additionally, the `AssertionRewritingHook` and `AssertionRewriter` classes in `rewrite.py` appear to manage how assertions are rewritten, which aligns with the requirement to improve the rewriting process for iterables used with `all`/`any`.",

This might involve adding new methods or modifying existing ones to recognize these calls and process them differently.\n\nThe changes need to be focused on the handling of `all` and `any` calls within the `assert` statements. This requires modifying the part of the `visit_Assert` method where the test of the assertion is visited and processed. Specifically, lines 843 and 852 are relevant as they involve the visiting and processing of the assertion test which is where the unrolling of iterables for `all` and `any` calls should be implemented.",
