These files are central to the assertion rewriting and comparison logic in pytest, which is directly relevant to the issue. The `AssertionRewriter` class in `rewrite.py` is responsible for rewriting assertions, which could potentially be adjusted to unroll iterable objects before passing them to `all`/`any`. In `util.py`, several functions (`assertrepr_compare`, `_diff_text`, and others) handle detailed comparison and representation of failing assertions, suggesting areas where the failure messages could be enhanced to include more context about the iterable contents. Specifically, the functions `_compare_eq_iterable` and `_compare_eq_sequence` could be modified to provide more detailed failure reports for iterables, which aligns with the request to improve failure messages for `all`/`any` calls by unrolling the iterable. Based on this analysis, I identified specific code spans that are most relevant to the solution, focusing on the functions and methods involved in assertion rewriting and detailed comparison utilities.",
