These methods handle the rewriting of assert statements and boolean operations, respectively. The `set_location` function is also relevant as it sets the location of nodes in the parsed AST, which is important for generating meaningful error messages. In `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, the `assertrepr_compare` function and its helper functions (`_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, `_compare_eq_cls`, `_notin_text`) are relevant as they generate detailed explanations for assertion failures, which aligns with the goal of improving failure messages. These functions cover various types of comparisons and could be leveraged to provide more detailed failure reports for `all`/`any` calls.
