The AssertionRewriter class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` appears to be responsible for rewriting assertions. Particularly, the `visit_BoolOp` method within this class handles boolean operations like `all` and `any`. By examining the code, I see that it attempts to handle boolean operations by iterating through the values and appending explanations for failures. This mechanism aligns well with the need to improve failure messages for iterable assertions as reported in the issue. Based on the issue's description and the context of the code, I conclude that the `visit_BoolOp` method is directly relevant to addressing the problem of improving the failure messages for `all`/`any` calls.",
