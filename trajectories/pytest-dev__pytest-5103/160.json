The proposed solution is to rewrite the assertion to provide more meaningful reports similar to a for loop. Examining the current file context and new search results, the main focus should be on the `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. The `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp` methods are particularly relevant as they handle the rewriting of assert statements and boolean operations. Additionally, the utility functions in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` provide helper methods for generating detailed comparisons, which could be integrated into the rewriting process to enhance the output of `all`/`any` unrolling. Specifically, `assertrepr_compare` and its helper functions like `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls` are key for generating detailed explanations on assertion failures. These functionalities should be leveraged during the unrolling process to provide meaningful reports for `all`/`any` calls.",

The user wants the assertion re-writer to 'unroll' the iterator to the third form for better reporting. The provided code spans in `rewrite.py` handle the rewriting of assert statements, including visiting `Assert`, `BoolOp`, and other relevant nodes. However, the current identified spans do not directly address the unrolling of iterables for `all`/`any` calls. The new search results introduce additional methods within the `AssertionRewriter` class, such as `run`, `is_rewrite_disabled`, `variable`, `assign`, and others, which could potentially be used to implement the desired unrolling functionality. Consequently, these new methods and the existing ones related to the `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp` should be considered for the solution. The `util.py` file also contains utility functions like `_compare_eq_iterable` which, although not directly related to the unrolling task, are useful for generating detailed comparison reports and could be integrated into the solution. Integrating these findings into the solution will require careful consideration on how to modify or extend the current rewriter to unroll the iterable and then use the existing reporting utilities to generate detailed failure messages.",
