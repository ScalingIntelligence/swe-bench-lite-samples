The current messages are not useful, as they do not provide specific details about which elements in the iterable caused the failure. To address this, a solution could involve modifying the assertion rewriter to 'unroll' the iterator into a more detailed form, similar to the for loop in the provided example. Given the context, it is likely that modifications will be needed in the assertion rewriting process, specifically in the files handling assertion rewriting and utility functions.",

The current implementation of `AssertionRewriter` in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` is relevant. It is responsible for rewriting assert statements in tests to provide more informative failure messages. The `visit_Assert` method in `AssertionRewriter` class is particularly relevant as it handles the transformation of assert statements, including those involving `all` and `any`. This method could be modified to unroll iterables in `all`/`any` calls to improve the error messages. The method `visit_BoolOp` is also relevant as it specifically handles boolean operations, which include `all` and `any`. The provided code also includes methods like `visit_Call_35`, `visit_Call_legacy`, `visit_Attribute`, `visit_Compare`, and others that contribute to the overall understanding of how assertions are rewritten and could be relevant if further modifications are needed. The `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods are the primary code spans that should be focused on to address the reported issue.",

These methods and spans are relevant to the reported issue as they show how the assertion rewriter currently handles assert statements, including how it processes `all` and `any` calls within those statements. This information is crucial for understanding how the assertion rewriter might be improved to better handle and provide more useful failure messages for `all`/`any` calls. The other file `doc/en/example/assertion/failure_demo.py` provides examples of failing test cases and is useful for understanding the context of the issue, but it does not contain the code or logic to 'unroll' the iterator as mentioned in the reported issue.",

When such a call is detected, it should 'unroll' the iterable into a series of individual assert statements, similar to how a for loop would handle it. This should mimic the behavior that provides a more detailed failure report for each element in the iterable.\n\nThe instructions require modification of the `visit_Assert` method to detect and handle calls to `all`/`any` within an assert statement. This requires changes in the logic where the assert statement is processed, specifically around line 843 where the test of the assert is visited and processed.",
