Specifically, when using `all`/`any` with a generator expression or list comprehension, the failure message is not informative enough. The proposal suggests that the assertion rewriter should 'unroll' the iterator to make the failure messages more descriptive, similar to how a for loop would provide more details on the assertion failure. Given the issue's description and examples, the relevant files to investigate are those related to the assertion rewriter and comparison utility within pytest. These files likely contain the logic responsible for handling and formatting assertion messages. By focusing on these files, we can identify the parts of the codebase where improvements need to be made to enhance the failure messages for `all`/`any` calls.",
