The desired outcome is to have failure messages that are as informative as those generated by the for loop while maintaining the conciseness of using `all`/`any`.\n\nTo address this, we need to focus on the `AssertionRewriter` class within the `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file, as this class is responsible for rewriting assertions to provide better failure messages. Specifically, the `visit_BoolOp` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class should be examined to see how it handles `all`/`any` expressions and if it can be modified to provide more detailed failure messages.\n\nAdditionally, the `assertrepr_compare` function in the `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` file is also relevant, as it generates detailed comparison explanations, which could be useful for improving the failure messages of `all`/`any` expressions.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the `visit_BoolOp` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class seems to be the most relevant code span related to rewriting boolean operations. The other functions in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, such as `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_iterable`, etc., are more focused on detailed comparison for equality checks rather than boolean operations.

The provided code hints at the potential to further develop this method to effectively 'unroll' the iterator and report individual failures in a more detailed manner, similar to how a for loop would behave. However, while the current code is a good starting point and certainly relevant, it does not fully implement the desired 'unrolling' behavior for `all`/`any` calls that results in improved failure messages as described in the issue.
