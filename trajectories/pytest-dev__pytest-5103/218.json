The proposed solution is to have the assertion re-writer 'unroll' the iterator to a form similar to the for loop, which provides more meaningful reports. The relevant code will likely be found in files related to assertion rewriting and reporting, particularly those handling the `all`/`any` operations and the formatting of assertion messages.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about improving the failure messages generated by the `all`/`any` functions in pytest. The user wants the assertion rewriter to 'unroll' the iterator to provide more meaningful failure reports, similar to a for-loop. The search results include a module containing test cases with various assertions and a module responsible for rewriting assertions. The `failure_demo.py` file contains various test cases demonstrating different types of assertion failures, which could be relevant for understanding and addressing the issue. The `rewrite.py` file contains the `AssertionRewriter` class, which is responsible for rewriting assertions in pytest. The `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp` methods in the `AssertionRewriter` class seem particularly relevant, as they handle the rewriting of assertion statements and boolean operations, which could be key to implementing the proposed improvement.",

The example provided highlights that the failure messages are more informative when using a for loop for the assertion, as it pinpoints the exact item causing the failure. The proposed solution suggests that the assertion rewriter should 'unroll' the iterator to mimic the third form (for loop) and use the existing reports.\n\nThe current file context shows relevant files and spans within the pytest codebase responsible for rewriting assertions. Specifically, the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods, such as `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp`, are crucial for understanding how assertions are currently rewritten and how they might be enhanced for better reporting.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context on the `AssertionRewriter` class, which is instrumental in managing the rewriting of assertions in pytest. The methods `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp` address the rewriting of assert statements and boolean operations, respectively. These methods currently handle the rewriting of assertions but do not specifically address the issue of improving the failure messages for `all` and `any` functions. This presents an opportunity to modify or extend these methods to better handle the unrolling of iterables within `all` and `any` calls, thereby improving the reporting of assertion failures.\n\nGiven the complexity and importance of these methods, marking the entire `AssertionRewriter` class for further inspection and potential modification will be beneficial to address the reported issue effectively.",
