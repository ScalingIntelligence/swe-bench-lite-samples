The relevant sections are the `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` and `AssertionRewriter.visit_BoolOp` methods. These methods handle the rewriting of assertions and boolean operations respectively. The `visit_Assert` method specifically deals with the rewriting of `assert` statements, including how to handle messages and exceptions when an assertion fails. The `visit_BoolOp` method is crucial for handling the boolean operations like `all`/`any`, which are central to the user's problem. These methods contain the logic for transforming assertion statements into more informative forms, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.
