The current failure messages do not provide enough context to understand which specific elements in the iterable caused the assertion to fail. The goal is to have the assertion rewriter 'unroll' the iterator into a form that provides better reporting, akin to the for loop form which offers more detailed failure messages. To address this, the focus should be on the assertion rewriting mechanisms in pytest, specifically the 'AssertionRewriter' class and related functions in '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and 'util.py'. Searching for the specific functions and classes involved in assertion rewriting will help pinpoint where modifications are needed to improve the failure messages for `all` and `any` calls.",

The search results provide detailed context on how pytest rewrites assertions, particularly in the `AssertionRewriter` class. This class handles the transformation of assert statements into more informative forms. Key methods such as `visit_Assert`, `visit_BoolOp`, and `visit_Compare` are crucial as they deal directly with the handling and transformation of assert statements, including those involving `all` and `any`. These methods can be modified or leveraged to implement the proposed changes that would unroll the iterable for `all`/`any` calls and provide better failure messages. Other methods like `visit_Call_35`, `visit_Name`, and `visit_Attribute` help in understanding how expressions are being processed and how we can intervene to modify the final output for more informative asserts.",
