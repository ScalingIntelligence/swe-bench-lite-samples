The provided example demonstrates how current failure messages are insufficient, especially when compared to the detailed output of a for loop. The key requirement is to 'unroll' the iterator in `all`/`any` calls to produce more informative failure reports, similar to what a for loop would provide. The search results include code spans from `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`. These files are relevant as they contain functions and classes that handle assertion rewriting and comparison explanations, which are directly related to the issue. Specifically, `AssertionRewriter` class in `rewrite.py` and functions like `assertrepr_compare`, `_diff_text`, and others in `util.py` are crucial for modifying the behavior of assertions. For instance, `_format_boolop` in `rewrite.py` deals with formatting boolean operations, and `assertrepr_compare` in `util.py` provides detailed comparison reports, which could be modified to include 'unrolling' logic for iterables in `all`/`any` operations. These findings suggest that the identified code spans are relevant and could be starting points for implementing the proposed enhancement of unrolling iterables for better failure messages in `all`/`any` calls.",
