The goal is to have meaningful failure reports similar to those produced by a for loop. The relevant files seem to be within the `src/_pytest/assertion` directory, specifically `rewrite.py`, `util.py`, and `__init__.py`. These files contain the `AssertionRewriter` class and utility functions related to assertion handling. Therefore, the search should focus on these files to find the specific logic related to rewriting assertions and handling booleans, as that is where the improvements need to be made.",

The example provided shows that while generator expressions and list comprehensions are used, the error messages are not informative. The user proposes that the assertion re-writer should 'unroll' the iterator to resemble a for loop, which offers more detailed error reporting. The search results include relevant files such as `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, and `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` which contain functions for comparison, boolean operations, and assertion rewriting. Specifically, the code spans such as `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, and `assertrepr_compare` in `util.py` are directly related to comparing and explaining assertion results, which could be modified to include more detailed reporting for iterables. Similarly, the `AssertionRewriter` class in `rewrite.py` handles the rewriting of assertions, which might need adjustments to implement the proposed 'unrolling' of iterables.",
