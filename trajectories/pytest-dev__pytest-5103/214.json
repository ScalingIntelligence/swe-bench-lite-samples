The primary goal is to improve the failure messages for `all`/`any` calls by 'unrolling' the iterator. The current implementation of `visit_BoolOp` in the `AssertionRewriter` class is a good starting point as it already handles boolean operations and their explanations. Specifically, the method manages the evaluation of each value within the boolean operation and appends explanations to a list, which is then formatted and used in the failure message. This approach seems aligned with the goal of making the failure messages more meaningful by detailing each evaluated element. Therefore, further refinement of the `visit_BoolOp` method, especially around how it handles and formats the explanations, could directly address the issue of improving the reports for `all`/`any` calls. Additionally, other methods within the `AssertionRewriter` class might also need examination to ensure consistency in how they handle and report assertion failures.",
