The `visit_Assert` method in `AssertionRewriter` is particularly relevant as it processes the `assert` statements, and modifying this method could potentially address the issue by improving the handling of iterables in assertions. Additionally, the `visit_BoolOp` method could also be relevant as it deals with boolean operations. The utility functions like `assertrepr_compare` and its helper functions provide the detailed explanations for failed assertions, which could be leveraged to provide better failure messages for `all`/`any` calls on iterables.
