The current implementation in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` involves the `AssertionRewriter` class, which already has methods to rewrite assertions, including `visit_Assert` and `visit_BoolOp`. These methods handle the rewriting of assertion statements, including handling boolean operations. However, the current implementation does not explicitly 'unroll' the iterable for `all`/`any` calls to provide better failure messages as detailed in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to potentially enhance or modify would be those within the `visit_BoolOp` method, as this method is responsible for handling boolean operations potentially used within `all`/`any` calls. Specifically, it might be necessary to extend the handling of boolean operations in this method to unroll iterables and provide detailed failure messages, similar to the third form of the provided example using a for loop. Since the `AssertionRewriter` class already handles assertion rewriting and has methods for handling boolean operations, it is a suitable place to implement the enhancement to unroll iterables and improve failure messages for `all`/`any` calls.",
