These methods are crucial for understanding how assertions are processed and rewritten during the pytest execution. Particularly, `visit_BoolOp` may be relevant for handling the `all`/`any` calls due to its responsibility in visiting boolean operations. Additionally, `visit_Assert` and the context management methods like `push_format_context` and `pop_format_context` are also essential for managing the format and context of assertions, which could be expanded or modified to handle 'unrolling' of iterables for better error reporting.",
