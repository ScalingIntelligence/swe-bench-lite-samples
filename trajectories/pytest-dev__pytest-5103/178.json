The goal is to make these messages more informative by 'unrolling' the iterable in the assertions. Files relevant to this issue are likely to be in the assertion rewriting module of pytest, as this module is responsible for modifying assertions to produce better output. The provided context points to specific files and parts of files that might contain the relevant code. I will specify the file pattern to focus on the assertion rewriter module and include the names of relevant functions and classes for a more targeted search.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about improving the failure messages when using `all`/`any` functions with iterables. The user wants the iterator to be 'unrolled' into a form that provides more meaningful reports, similar to the for loop. The current failure messages for `all`/`any` are not useful because they don't provide information about which elements caused the assertion to fail.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are found in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. This file contains the `AssertionRewriter` class, which is responsible for rewriting assertions in a way that improves failure messages. Specifically, the spans related to `visit_Assert`, `visit_BoolOp`, and `visit_Compare` methods are highly relevant as they handle the rewriting of assertions involving `all` and `any` functions.\n\nThese methods are crucial for understanding how assertions are visited and rewritten by the `AssertionRewriter`. The `visit_Assert` method is responsible for handling the `assert` statements, including those that use `all` and `any`. The `visit_BoolOp` method deals with boolean operations, which are central to `all` and `any` functions. The `visit_Compare` method handles comparisons, which are also relevant as they form the basis of many assertions.\n\nIn addition, the `assertrepr_compare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` could be useful for understanding how comparison assertions are represented in failure messages. While it might not directly address the `all`/`any` issue, it provides context on how pytest handles comparisons in assertions.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans clearly pertain to the reported issue and provide the necessary context to understand how to potentially improve the handling of `all`/`any` failure messages in pytest.",
