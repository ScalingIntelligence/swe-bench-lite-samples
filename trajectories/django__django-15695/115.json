The crash occurs when re-applying `RenameIndex()` and the error message suggests that the index 'new_pony_test_idx' already exists in the PostgreSQL database. The issue is described in more detail in the `OperationTests` class within `tests/migrations/test_operations.py`, which suggests testing scenarios where the `RenameIndex` operation might cause the crash.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, several relevant code spans have been identified:\n1. In `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, the `RenameIndex` class and its methods such as `__init__`, `database_forwards`, and `database_backwards` are found. This class is directly related to the renaming of indexes and thus relevant to the issue.\n2. The `RenameModel` class, though not directly related to renaming indexes, is located in the same file and could be contextually relevant since model renaming operations might interact with index operations.\n3. In `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class contains the `rename_index` method which is responsible for executing SQL commands to rename indexes. This method is crucial for understanding how index renaming is implemented at the database level.\n\nThese identified code spans collectively provide insight into how the `RenameIndex` operation is defined and how it is executed against the database. This information should be enough to start investigating the root cause of the crash as described in the reported issue, particularly focusing on the handling of unnamed indexes and the potential duplication of index names during re-application of the `RenameIndex` operation.",
