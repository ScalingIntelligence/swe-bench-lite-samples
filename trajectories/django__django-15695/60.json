The issue indicates that when moving backward and forward, the RenameIndex() function crashes because it doesn't handle the case where an unnamed index is being moved. This is evident from the section where 'relation \"new_pony_test_idx\" already exists' is mentioned. This error typically occurs when an index with the same name already exists in the database. Given this context, the relevant parts of the code are those that handle the renaming process in both directions (forward and backward), as well as the initial creation and validation of these indexes. Specifically, the analysis shows that the RenameIndex.database_forwards and RenameIndex.database_backwards methods are critical. These methods need to ensure uniqueness when renaming indexes, especially when dealing with unnamed or auto-generated names.",

The `database_backwards` method appears to handle unnamed indexes by returning a no-op, which might be an area of concern if the behavior is not correctly managed. Additionally, the `rename_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` is used to rename indexes, and it seems to handle the renaming by removing the old index and adding a new one if the database does not support renaming indexes directly.
