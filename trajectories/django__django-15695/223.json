The error messages indicate a problem with handling index names, particularly when they are auto-generated. The relevant code appears to be located in several files related to database schema operations and migrations. The provided context includes files related to migration operations, schema editing, and backend-specific schema implementations. The primary focus should be on the `RenameIndex` class within `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, and other classes that interact with index operations. Additionally, the PostgreSQL-specific error message points to potential handling issues in the PostgreSQL schema editor. Thus, search parameters should include specific functions and classes related to index renaming and database operations.",

Analyzed the reported issue which describes a crash in RenameIndex() when an unnamed index is moving backward and forward, specifically highlighting the need to restore the old auto-generated name for unnamed indexes in unique_together. The issue points to a specific test in tests/migrations/test_operations.py and mentions a crash detail specific to PostgreSQL. \n\n2. Reviewed the current file context which indicates no relevant code has been identified yet, focusing on the initial search results.\n\n3. Processed the new search results by examining each code span: \n   a. The RenameIndex class and its methods were of most interest as they directly handle index renaming and restoration. \n   b. Specifically, the RenameIndex.state_forwards method manages state changes affecting indexes which could correlate to the issue's need to restore auto-generated names.\n   c. The RenameIndex.database_forwards and RenameIndex.database_backwards methods are critical as they handle the actual database operations related to index renaming and strategy for moving backwards.\n\n4. Assessed if the issue suggests new functions or classes, identified the relevant existing code which is likely to be used for implementing the new functionality or addressing the current issue: the RenameIndex class methods.\n\n5. Reviewed the entire sections of code to ensure a complete understanding which significantly aids in accurately determining relevance and completeness. This includes all class definitions, methods, and related import statements.\n\n6. Verified whether there are other parts of the codebase referenced that might be relevant: only the identified RenameIndex class code and specific methods like state_forwards, database_forwards, and database_backwards were crucial.\n\n7. Extracted all relevant code spans directly related to the issue concerning RenameIndex operations, specifically focusing on methods that handle state changes and database operations.\n\n8. Decided on the provided search result being relevant to the reported issue, particularly centering on the RenameIndex class and its methods handling the issue's described operations.",
