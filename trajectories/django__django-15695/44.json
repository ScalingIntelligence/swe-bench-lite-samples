The error message indicates that the index 'new_pony_test_idx' already exists, which suggests that the operation might not be handling the existence check correctly or could be failing to correctly revert the operation. To address this, we need to focus on the RenameIndex class and its methods within the django.db.migrations.operations module. Additionally, we should look at the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class and its rename_index method in the django.db.backends.base.schema module to understand how the index renaming is being managed at the schema level. The provided files hint at where the problem might lie, especially around how indexes are managed and renamed during migrations.",

This suggests that the issue lies in how RenameIndex handles unnamed indexes, especially in regards to their names and possibly how they are processed during database operations. Given this context, focusing on the RenameIndex class and related methods in the search results is crucial. Specifically, looking at how old_name and old_fields are managed, how indexes are renamed or reapplied, and how backwards operations are handled should provide insight into where the problem might be. Additionally, the schema.py file's BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.rename_index method is also crucial since this is where database index renaming operations are directly handled.
