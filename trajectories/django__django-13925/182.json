This could indicate a problem with how primary keys are being handled in model inheritance or a change in Django's handling of primary keys in newer versions. In the search results, we have a code span within 'BaseModelFormSet.add_fields' that deals with setting up fields in a form related to a model, including the primary key. This span seems relevant because it handles cases where the primary key might not be editable due to being an 'AutoField', which is directly related to the warning message. The logic checks if the primary key is an 'AutoField' or similar and sets it up accordingly, which suggests this part of the code might be involved in the compatibility issue between different Django versions regarding primary keys in models.",

The `BaseModelFormSet` and `BaseInlineFormSet` classes in `django/forms/models.py` demonstrate how primary keys are treated in formsets, particularly with fields like `AutoField`, `ForeignKey`, and `OneToOneField`. This context sheds light on how Django internally manages and validates primary keys. However, to directly address the issue, it's crucial to find the exact model definitions for `User`, `Block`, and other models mentioned in the issue to check if they correctly inherit primary keys and do not rely on auto-created primary keys when not intended. Additionally, inspecting the Django settings for the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` configuration is necessary to ensure it's set appropriately. Since the search results from the earlier query provided no relevant results, it's essential to narrow the search to these specific areas.",

This helps understand the mechanisms behind form handling and PK management but doesn't directly address specific model configurations except by inference. The `Field` class and its subclasses in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, including `AutoField`, `BigAutoField`, `SmallAutoField`, and more, are crucial for understanding Django's approach to defining and handling fields in models, including the specification of primary keys and how they regulate the user-accessible attributes of models. Despite their relevance, specific model configurations such as those for `accounts.User`, `blocks.Block`, and others, where primary key issues are explicitly reported, are missing in the context provided. Given this, the search should be refined to specifically target these models and their primary key definitions, as well as the Django settings file for the configuration of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.",
