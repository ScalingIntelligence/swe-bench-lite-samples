This works in Django 3.1 but fails with a specific warning in Django 3.2 alpha related to auto-created primary keys. The relevant models are listed, each showing a specific warning. To address this, we need to locate the models where primary keys are defined or where they should be defined explicitly, ensuring they do not use auto-created primary keys. The hints suggest configuring the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting or attributes like SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig.default_auto_field. Additionally, the issue mentions that primary keys are already defined in ancestor models, such as class Entity from which class User inherits. The search should focus on these models and their configurations.",
