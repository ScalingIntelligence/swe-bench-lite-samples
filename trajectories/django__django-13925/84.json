This contrasts with expected behavior in Django 3.1. The models mentioned in the warning messages should be investigated to ensure they correctly define or inherit primary keys, and to see if there are any discrepancies or new checks introduced in Django 3.2 that might trigger this warning. The relevant Django source files related to model base classes, field definitions, and options handling might contain the necessary information to resolve this issue.",

The search results include several key sections of Django's ModelBase and Options classes from django/db/models/base.py and django/db/models/options.py, respectively. These sections handle primary key setup, management, and checks within Django's ORM. Notably, the ModelBase.__new__ span handles the creation of new model classes and their attributes, which is crucial for understanding how primary keys might be auto-created and managed. The Options.setup_pk span is also relevant as it specifically deals with setting up the primary key for a model, which is directly related to the issue of inherited primary keys and auto-created fields. The Model._check_default_pk span is another critical piece, as it checks the default primary key settings for models, which ties directly into the reported issue. This section ensures that the default primary key configuration aligns with Django's settings and app configurations, hinting at potential conflicts or misconfigurations that could lead to the models.W042 warning. Therefore, these spans from the provided search results are highly relevant to the reported issue and offer insight into how Django handles primary keys and their configurations, which is crucial for addressing the warning and ensuring proper management of inherited primary keys.",
