The error messages indicate that auto-created primary keys are being used when they should not be, despite primary keys being defined in ancestor models. The search results provide context for the User model in django/contrib/auth/models.py, which inherits from the AbstractUser model. This context is relevant as it shows how model inheritance is handled, particularly focusing on the User model which extends AbstractUser. The critical part here is identifying where and how the primary key is being dealt with, especially focusing on the User model's Meta class, which does not override the primary key setting explicitly. This lack of explicit primary key definition in the User model may be contributing to the issue described, resembling the behavior noted in the error message. However, the search results do not directly address setting a specific type for the primary key or adjusting DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD as suggested by the hint in the error message.

The warning suggests the AUTO_CREATED primary key is being used instead of a manually specified one, even though the primary key is defined in the ancestor model. The hint provided in the warning suggests configuring the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting or the AppConfig.default_auto_field attribute to point to a subclass of AutoField. This might indicate that Django 3.2 alpha is not correctly detecting the manually specified primary keys in inherited models. Given the current file context and search results, the files and code spans that are relevant to this issue are those that define or inherit from models where the primary key is specified. The search results include 'django/contrib/auth/models.py' which contains the definition of the 'User' model that inherits from 'AbstractUser'. This is relevant because the issue is about models that inherit from other models and handle primary keys. Importantly, the 'AbstractUser' does not explicitly define a primary key, which could be contributing to the warning about the AUTO_CREATED primary key.",
