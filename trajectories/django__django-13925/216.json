The `PermissionsMixin`, `AbstractUser`, and `User` classes are all involved in defining user permissions and authentication details, which may be related to the primary key usage described in the warning. However, the search results do not directly address the primary key issue or the proposed solution involving setting DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD. More specifically, code spans detailing how primary keys are defined or inherited (if explicitly set) in the parent `AbstractUser` and child `User` models are not clearly present. Additionally, the provided context and search results do not discuss or show the potential configuration settings (`DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`) mentioned in the warning's hint. Therefore, while the current context is relevant, further inspection or additional search for primary key specifications or DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD configurations in the Django settings or model definitions would likely be necessary to fully address the reported issue.",
