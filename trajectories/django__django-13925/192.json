The warnings suggest that the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting or the respective AppConfig.default_auto_field attributes need to be configured to point to a subclass of AutoField, e.g., 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'. Given the nature of the issue and the fact that multiple models are affected, it's important to focus on the models themselves and their configurations in the Django settings. The search should include Django settings files and any relevant model definitions to ensure alignment with Django 3.2's requirements.",

This suggests that the models, which should have primary keys from their ancestor model, are not being recognized as such in the new Django version and are instead defaulting to auto-created primary keys. Based on this context, I reviewed the search results to identify sections of code likely related to model definitions and primary key settings, including the classes AbstractUser and User in 'django/contrib/auth/models.py', and also the field definitions in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' which includes definitions for AutoField, BigAutoField, and SmallAutoField. These sections mostly cover the definitions of fields and models, which are directly related to the issue of primary key inheritance. The next step would be to configure or adjust the models to explicitly set the primary key, if needed, following Django's recommendations for the new version, possibly involving adjustments to settings or the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting in Django's configuration.",
