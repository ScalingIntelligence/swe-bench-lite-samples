This suggests an issue with how the index entries are processed and grouped. The relevant files and functions to investigate are primarily in the indexing and HTML building components of Sphinx, including modules handling index entries, HTML builders, and translators responsible for generating the HTML output. The focus should be on the create_index method in the IndexEntries class, the generate_indices method in LaTeXTranslator, and related functions in the HTML builder classes. Additionally, functions and modules dealing with index entries like process_index_entry in sphinx/util/nodes.py should be inspected.",

This issue directly relates to the handling of index entries and their categorization. The search results provide several relevant sections of the codebase that manipulate and categorize index entries. In `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`, the `IndexEntries` class and its methods (`create_index`, `add_entry`, etc.) deal with creating and sorting index entries. The use of regex and key functions for sorting suggests that this is where the categorization logic resides. Additionally, the LaTeX and HTML translators (`LaTeXTranslator` in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` and `HTMLTranslator` in `sphinx/writers/html.py`) process these entries for different output formats, indicating a need to ensure consistent handling across formats. The `StandaloneHTMLBuilder` class in `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py` also directly deals with writing the generated index, making it another relevant section. Furthermore, the function `process_index_entry` in `sphinx/util/nodes.py` processes individual index entries, which could also be a source of the duplication issue if not properly normalized. Given this comprehensive review, the identified code spans should help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue by focusing on the logic for categorizing and sorting index entries across the codebase.",
