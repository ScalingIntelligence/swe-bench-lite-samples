I noticed in the provided code spans that the 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' file contains the logic for creating and sorting index entries. Specifically, the 'IndexEntries.create_index' method includes the logic for sorting entries into sections based on their initial characters. This method uses a key function to determine the sorting order, which currently places entries starting with certain special characters under the 'Symbols' heading. This logic needs to be adjusted to prevent the creation of multiple 'Symbols' sections. Additionally, the 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' file contains the LaTeX translator logic for handling index entries, but since the issue is primarily about HTML output, it seems less relevant to the immediate issue. The focus should be on updating the sorting logic in 'IndexEntries.create_index' to ensure that characters like _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_ are handled in a way that avoids creating multiple sections.",

Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n"
