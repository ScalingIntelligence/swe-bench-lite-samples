Specifically, it describes a situation where certain special characters (_@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_) are causing the index to split into multiple 'Symbols' sections, with duplicate links pointing to the first 'Symbols' section. Upon analyzing the provided search results, the key parts of the code that seem relevant to this issue are found in the `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` file. Here, the `create_index` method of the `IndexEntries` class is responsible for creating the index structure. It involves processes such as grouping entries by keys, sorting them, and handling different types of index entries. The method uses regular expressions to fix entries and Unicode normalization to sort entries, which are central to managing special characters and their grouping in the index. Therefore, the focus should be on refining the key sorting and grouping logic within this method to ensure that entries with special characters are handled properly without causing duplicate 'Symbols' sections.",

This discrepancy in handling such characters is a key focus for identifying relevant code spans. The provided code context and search results contain several sections that deal with index creation, character handling, and sorting. Specifically, the 'create_index' method within the 'IndexEntries' class is crucial as it processes and sorts index entries, potentially influencing how special characters are categorized.\n\nThe 'create_index' method uses a key function, 'keyfunc', to sort entries, and this sorting mechanism could be where the logic for handling special characters and distinguishing them from other entries might be implemented or found lacking. The initial analysis of 'create_index' suggests it does not explicitly differentiate between special characters and normal alphabetic characters at a glance, potentially explaining the issue of multiple 'Symbols' sections.\n\nAdditionally, the 'process_index_entry' function in 'sphinx/util/nodes.py' might also be relevant, as it processes individual entries and could house logic that is not correctly handling special characters. However, deeper code inspection within the 'create_index' method reveals sorting logic and handling of categories, which appears more directly related to the reported issue of multiple 'Symbols' sections.\n\nTherefore, the focus for relevant code spans should be on sections involved in index creation and sorting, particularly where special characters are involved or should be differentiated.",
