The first 'Symbols' section contains '@' entries, and the second contains '\u00a3' and '\u2190' entries. Both sections have the same HTML anchor, leading to incorrect linking. To address this, we need to identify the part of the code responsible for grouping and labeling these index entries. It seems relevant to check the implementation of index creation in the `IndexEntries` class and the methods handling index nodes in the LaTeX and HTML writers. Additionally, the `_make_id` function in `sphinx/util/nodes.py` might be creating duplicate IDs for these sections.",

Specifically, entries starting with '@', '\u00a3', and '\u2190' are causing the creation of two 'Symbols' sections in the index, with both sections having the same anchor. This leads to incorrect linking behavior.\n\nFirst, I examined the `IndexEntries` class in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`. This class is responsible for creating the index entries and sorting them. The method `create_index` groups entries and sorts them based on specific criteria, which might be relevant to the issue.\n\nNext, I looked at the `HTMLTranslator` in `sphinx/writers/html.py`. This class is responsible for translating the document into HTML format and includes methods related to the handling of the index node. In particular, the `visit_index` method directly impacts how the index section is handled and displayed in the generated HTML.\n\nReading through the related code, I noticed that the sorting logic in `IndexEntries.create_index` is designed to categorize entries into different sections based on their first characters. The logic also handles how non-alpha characters like '@', '\u00a3', and '\u2190' are sorted into specific categories ('Symbols'), but there is no specific handling for these characters that might lead to the duplication or incorrect grouping as described in the issue.\n\nFinally, I reviewed the `LaTeXTranslator` class in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` but found it less relevant since the issue is related specifically to HTML output. The `_make_id` function in `sphinx/util/nodes.py` also seems unrelated.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant files and their identified span IDs that could be involved in resolving this issue are outlined in the 'identified_spans' output.",

The provided code spans from the file_context show how index entries are created and manipulated in the Sphinx environment, particularly in the 'IndexEntries' class and its 'create_index' method. This method appears to handle the grouping and sorting of index entries, including logic for handling special characters like '@', '\u00a3', and '\u2190'. In the search results, the 'sphinx/util/nodes.py' file contains functions for generating IDs, which might be related to how anchors are created for index entries. The '_make_id' function might be relevant for understanding how the problematic 'Symbols' anchor is being generated. Additionally, 'sphinx/writers/html.py' provides the 'HTMLTranslator' class, which includes the 'visit_index' method responsible for handling index nodes during HTML translation. This method could be where the HTML output issue is occurring.\n\nFrom the analysis, it seems necessary to investigate further the ID generation process, especially the '_make_id' function, as it might be creating duplicate IDs for different sections.
