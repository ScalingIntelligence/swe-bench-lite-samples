This might be due to the way the index entries are being sorted or grouped. The relevant code spans are likely to be found in the 'IndexEntries.create_index' method and possibly in the 'visit_index' methods across different translators (like LaTeXTranslator and HTMLTranslator), as these are responsible for sorting and rendering index entries. Additionally, the keyfunc3 function within 'IndexEntries.create_index' seems relevant as it deals with the calculation of the key and grouping of entries, which could directly affect how the 'Symbols' section is generated and grouped. However, the code review did not reveal any obvious causes for the issue within the provided spans, suggesting a need for a deeper investigation into the processing of index keys and their grouping logic.",
