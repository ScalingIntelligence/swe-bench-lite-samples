The relevant code spans in the search results include 'IndexEntries' class, 'IndexEntries.__init__', 'IndexEntries.create_index', and related logic within these methods that handle index creation and sorting. Additionally, the 'StandaloneHTMLBuilder.write_genindex' method is relevant as it uses the IndexEntries class to write the general index. While the code in 'sphinx/writers/texinfo.py' is related to the Texinfo output format, it is not directly relevant to the HTML output issue reported. Therefore, the identified spans are focused on the 'indexentries.py' and 'html/__init__.py' files.",
