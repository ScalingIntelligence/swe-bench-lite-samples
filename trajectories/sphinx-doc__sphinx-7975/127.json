To address this, it's crucial to identify the code responsible for processing and grouping index entries, especially focusing on how entries are categorized and sorted. The provided search results offer several key sections of code that could be relevant:\n\n1. The `IndexEntries` class in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` is likely central as it contains methods for handling index entries and grouping them. Particularly relevant is the `create_index` method, which sorts and groups index entries based on various criteria, including special characters.\n2. The `process_index_entry` function in `sphinx/util/nodes.py` is also relevant as it processes individual index entries, preparing them for inclusion in the index. This function's logic could influence how entries are initially categorized or grouped.\n3. The `generate_indices` method within the `LaTeXTranslator` class in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` may also indirectly impact the issue by influencing how indices are ultimately rendered, though its primary relevance might be in PDF output rather than HTML.\n\nBy focusing on these sections, it should be possible to determine how entries starting with special characters are handled and identify potential discrepancies leading to the duplicated 'Symbols' sections.",

The method's use of regex and sorting logic suggests a potential source for the error, where the handling of these specific characters leads to the creation of multiple 'Symbols' sections. Insights from this file can guide further refinements in how index entries are processed and categorized to avoid such duplications. Additionally, the 'process_index_entry' function in 'sphinx/util/nodes.py' contributes to understanding how individual entries are initially handled and could also be a point of focus for refining character-specific handling within the indexing logic.",
