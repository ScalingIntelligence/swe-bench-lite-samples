Analysing the provided code, it is evident that the 'create_index' method within the 'IndexEntries' class in 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' is responsible for processing index entries and sorting them. This method includes logic for categorizing entries and dealing with different types of index entries, such as 'single', 'pair', 'triple', 'see', and 'seealso'. Furthermore, the method contains a specific section dealing with sorting and categorizing entries where non-alphabetic characters are leading, which might relate to the creation of the 'Symbols' category. Given this context, it is likely that the logic within this class is responsible for the issue at hand. Additionally, a potential relevant part could be the 'generate_indices' method in 'sphinx/writers/latex.py', which generates indices for LaTeX output and might have similar categorization logic that could also be related to the issue. However, the focus seems to be primarily on the HTML output, which is more directly handled by the 'IndexEntries' class.",

  "initial_message": "Two sections called Symbols in index\nWhen using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before \u201dnormal\u201d words and the second containing _\u00a3_ and _\u2190_ entries after the \u201dnormal\u201d words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n"
