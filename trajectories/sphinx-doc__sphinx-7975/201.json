This suggests that the bug might be in the index creation logic or the rendering of these special characters in the HTML output. Relevant files include those handling index entries, HTML building, and possibly LaTeX or Texinfo building if they affect HTML output. Given the context, the focus should be on modules that handle index creation and HTML rendering. The function `create_index` in `indexentries.py` and methods in `HTMLTranslator` and `StandaloneHTMLBuilder` are good starting points.",

This requires examining how index entries are managed and how they are translated into HTML format. The search results include files that manage index entries (sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py) and handle HTML translations in Sphinx (sphinx/writers/html.py and sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py). Relevant sections of code within these files include the class IndexEntries in indexentries.py, which handles the creation of index entries, and the StandaloneHTMLBuilder class in html/__init__.py, which manages HTML building and index generation. Additionally, the creation of indices in the HTML output seems to be closely related to the use_index attribute in StandaloneHTMLBuilder. The code spans investigated confirm the presence of logic for index entry creation and handling in the HTML builder context, but specifics regarding individual character handling in index entries are not explicitly detailed in these provided code spans. Further in-depth analysis specific to the handling of _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_ characters within the create_index method of the IndexEntries class could be necessary to fully determine relevance. However, based on the existence of these classes and their functions, and the current report's focus on index construction and character handling in output, these identified code spans are considered relevant to the issue. This analysis should be continued to ensure all critical aspects of character handling in index entries are covered.",
