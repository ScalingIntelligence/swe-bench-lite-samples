The focus should be on the `create_index` method in the `IndexEntries` class and potentially the `visit_index` method in the `LaTeXTranslator` class, as well as any related functions in the `sphinx.util.nodes` module that deal with processing index entries.

Specifically, it involves index entries starting with '_@_', '_\u00a3_', and '_\u2190_', which are causing two 'Symbols' sections to appear in the index, leading to confusion due to identical anchor links. To address this, it's essential to identify the code responsible for generating the index and determining how entries are categorized and grouped. The search results primarily focus on the 'IndexEntries' class in 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py', which contains methods for creating the index and adding entries. Additionally, the 'LaTeXTranslator' class in 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' and the 'process_index_entry' function in 'sphinx/util/nodes.py' further highlight the handling of index entries across different formats. Finally, the 'StandaloneHTMLBuilder' class in 'sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py' provides insights into how the HTML index is constructed and served. These code spans are highly relevant as they collectively manage the creation, categorization, and rendering of index entries, which directly implicates the issue at hand.",
