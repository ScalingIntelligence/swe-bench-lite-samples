The relevant code can be found in the `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` file, particularly in the `create_index` method where the index entries are processed and sorted. The method `keyfunc` is responsible for determining the category keys, and this is where we should look for the logic that might be treating _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_ differently. Additionally, the `visit_index` methods in various translators (`HTMLTranslator`, `HTML5Translator`, `LaTeXTranslator`, `ManualPageTranslator`, `TexinfoTranslator`, and `TextTranslator`) might also be relevant as they handle the rendering of index nodes, which could be where the duplication issue manifests in the HTML output.",
