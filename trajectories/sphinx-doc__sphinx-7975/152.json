            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the incorrect handling of special characters in the index section, leading to multiple 'Symbols' sections with the same anchor. Searching through the provided code, I identified relevant sections from the IndexEntries class in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`. This class contains methods for creating and organizing index entries, including the handling of different entry types (single, pair, triple, see, seealso). These methods handle the splitting of entries and the addition of entries to the dictionary. The key functions involved are `create_index`, which orchestrates the creation of the index, and `add_entry`, which manages the insertion of individual entries. Regarding the LaTeXTranslator class in `sphinx/writers/latex.py`, the `visit_index` method is relevant as it processes index entries for LaTeX output. This method handles the rendering of different types of index entries (single, pair, triple, see, seealso) and includes logic for escaping special characters. Although the primary issue seems to be in the index creation logic, the LaTeX rendering method is also important contextually.\n\nConsidering the issue's nature (special characters leading to duplicate 'Symbols' sections), the identified code spans directly address how entries are created, sorted, and grouped, including the handling of special characters. The section on calculating keys and grouping index entries by key in `create_index` is crucial, especially where it checks for alphabetical characters and groups everything else under 'Symbols'. The LaTeXTranslator class's handling of index entries further corroborates the necessity of considering the `visit_index` method. Therefore, I have identified these spans as directly relevant to the reported issue, noting that the `create_index` and `visit_index` methods are particularly pertinent.",
