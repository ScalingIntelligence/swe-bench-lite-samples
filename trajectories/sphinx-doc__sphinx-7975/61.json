The issue likely stems from the sorting and grouping logic in the 'create_index' method of the 'IndexEntries' class. This method handles the grouping of index entries into categories, potentially leading to situations where special characters cause entries to be grouped under 'Symbols' more than once. Additionally, the 'visit_index' method in the 'HTMLTranslator' class, which handles the rendering of index nodes in the HTML output, might be involved in how these sections are rendered and linked. Both of these methods are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue.",
