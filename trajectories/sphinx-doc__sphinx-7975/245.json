This behavior is not desired as both sections have the same anchor, causing confusion. To address this, I need to find the relevant code segments responsible for generating indices, processing index entries, and potentially determining the section titles or groupings in the HTML output. The search results provide several key code spans across different files and classes, notably LaTeXTranslator.generate_indices and IndexEntries.create_index, which are central to this functionality. Additionally, the LaTeXTranslator.visit_index and other visit_index methods across different Translator classes could be involved in processing specific index entries. The IndexEntries.create_index method is particularly informative as it contains logic for grouping entries into 'Symbols' and sorting them. It uses a regex to fix entries and has specific handling for grouping entries. Other methods like LaTeXTranslator.generate_indices also show detailed handling of index entries, important for understanding how characters like ' @_' are processed and possibly grouped into sections.",
