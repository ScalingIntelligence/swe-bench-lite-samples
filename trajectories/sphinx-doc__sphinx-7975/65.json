The key part of the issue is that both sections share the same anchor, causing links to lead to the first section. Upon analyzing the search results, there are several relevant code spans that handle index entries and their categorization into sections, including the handling of symbols. The code in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` contains the logic for creating index entries and sorting them, including the special handling of entries starting with symbols. Specifically, the `IndexEntries.create_index` method has code that categorizes entries under 'Symbols' if the first character is not alpha-numeric or _. Additionally, the `keyfunc3` function determines the category key for sorting entries and includes logic for symbols. This section of the code is directly relevant to the issue, as it affects how entries are grouped and displayed in the index. Other sections of the code, such as `LaTeXTranslator.generate_indices` and `TexinfoTranslator.collect_indices`, handle the generation of indices in different output formats but do not directly relate to the categorization issue in HTML output. Therefore, focusing on the `IndexEntries.create_index` method should provide sufficient context to address the duplication of 'Symbols' sections in the HTML output.",

Additionally, since the 'IndexEntries' class follows the processing in 'IndexDomain', examining its 'create_index' method and how it deals with keys and sorting might also provide insights into why the 'Symbols' sections are getting duplicated.

The search results provided contain additional parts of the IndexEntries class and other related files, but they do not directly address the issue of creating separate 'Symbols' sections for different characters.
