The problem seems to be related to how these characters are processed and grouped within the index entries. Relevant files could include those handling index entries, such as 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' or 'sphinx/util/nodes.py'. Additionally, files that generate indices, like 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' or 'sphinx/writers/html.py', might also be pertinent. Given the diversity of modules, it would be prudent to search broadly, focusing initially on modules that process or generate indices.",

By analyzing the code provided in the search results, we can identify relevant code spans that might be involved in generating these sections and handling the index entries that lead to this problem. Specifically, we should focus on the `IndexEntries` class and its methods (`create_index`, `add_entry`), as this class seems to be responsible for creating index entries and grouping them. Additionally, methods in `process_index_entry` in `sphinx/util/nodes.py` should be reviewed as they handle the processing of individual index entries, possibly leading to the incorrect grouping or rendering of 'Symbols' entries.

The search results include the 'HTMLTranslator' class which is relevant as it involves the translation of index entries to HTML. The 'visit_index' method in this class is particularly relevant because it processes index nodes, but it currently causes the entire node to be skipped, which is not aligned with resolving the issue of duplicate sections. The 'create_index' method in the 'IndexEntries' class from the previous context also provides important context for how index entries are created and grouped. This suggests that modifications may be needed in these areas to differentiate handling of these specific characters and ensure they are not grouped into duplicate sections.",
