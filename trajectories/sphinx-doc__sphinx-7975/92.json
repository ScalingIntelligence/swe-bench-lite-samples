The provided code is from the 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' file, which contains the 'IndexEntries' class responsible for creating the index entries. The key method here is 'create_index', which processes different types of index entries and organizes them into categories based on the first character of the entry. The sorting of entries is done in the 'keyfunc' and 'keyfunc2' methods. This code is relevant because it involves the creation and sorting of index entries, which is directly related to the issue of having multiple 'Symbols' sections in the output. By examining the code, it appears that the logic for grouping entries under 'Symbols' might be causing the issue due to the handling of specific characters like '@', '\u00a3', and '\u2190'. However, without seeing the entire section of code that handles theHTML rendering, it's hard to pinpoint exactly how to fix the issue. Further investigation might be necessary.",

Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n"
