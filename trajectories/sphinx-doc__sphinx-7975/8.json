After examining the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are likely found in 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py'. This file contains several functions and methods that handle index entries and their categorization, particularly 'merge_index_entries' and likely the surrounding methods and logic that process these entries. However, the direct reference to 'Symbols' grouping is not explicitly found in the snippets provided. It's crucial to note that the issue also involves HTML output, so there may be relevant code in other files like 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' and 'sphinx/writers/texinfo.py' that handle output formatting. The snippets from these files indicate that they generate indices in different formats likely used in the HTML output, further suggesting they could be related to the 'Symbols' issue. For instance, in 'sphinx/writers/latex.py', the 'generate_indices' method bolsters this correlation, suggesting this file manipulates and formats the index data including potential handling of special characters.",

This behavior is likely related to how the index entries are sorted and grouped. The code in the `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` file, specifically the `IndexEntries.create_index` method, is relevant as it deals with the creation and sorting of index entries. The method sorts entries based on their keys, potentially leading to the observed behavior if special characters are not handled consistently in the sorting logic. The `sphinx/writers/latex.py` and `sphinx/writers/texinfo.py` files, particularly the `generate_indices` and `collect_indices` methods, also handle index generation but do not appear to directly address the sorting issue mentioned in the report. Further analysis of the sorting and grouping logic in `IndexEntries.create_index` is necessary to determine if it correctly handles special characters and ensures they are grouped consistently under a single 'Symbols' section.",
