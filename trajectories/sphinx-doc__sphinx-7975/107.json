There are two _Symbols_ sections in the HTML output, which causes confusion as both sections share the same anchor. The issue requires identifying code related to index handling and generation in Sphinx to rectify the problem of multiple _Symbols_ sections and ensure correct linking.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant code spans:\n1. **sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py** - This file contains the `IndexEntries` class which is responsible for creating the index. It includes methods like `create_index` that handle the sorting and grouping of index entries. The logic for handling different types of index entries (single, pair, triple, see, seealso) is also present here. This file is crucial for understanding how index entries are processed and grouped.\n2. **sphinx/writers/latex.py** - This file includes the `LaTeXTranslator` class, which has a method `generate_indices` that generates LaTeX indices. Although relevant to LaTeX output, this file can offer insights into how indices are structured and grouped, which might be applicable to HTML output as well.\n3. **sphinx/writers/html.py** - This file includes the `HTMLTranslator` class, which handles HTML-specific translations. The `visit_index` method is relevant as it processes index nodes. However, the method currently skips processing, indicating a potential area of enhancement.\n4. **sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py** - This file includes the `StandaloneHTMLBuilder` class, which has a method `write_genindex` for writing the general index. This method handles the generation of the index HTML pages and may be where the multiple _Symbols_ sections issue manifests.\n\nGiven the context of the reported issue, the most relevant code spans are found within `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` and `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py`. These files directly address the generation and display of indices in the HTML output, making them critical for resolving the issue of multiple _Symbols_ sections.",

The current implementation of `keyfunc3` does not differentiate between the different special characters effectively, leading to improper grouping.
