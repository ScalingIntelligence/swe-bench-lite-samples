The issue is that these characters are causing the creation of two 'Symbols' sections in the index, leading to incorrect navigation due to the same anchor being used for both sections. The relevant code spans to address this issue would likely involve the methods responsible for creating index entries and sorting them, particularly 'IndexEntries.create_index' in 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py'. Additionally, the 'write_genindex' method in 'sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py' could also be relevant as it handles the generation of the index page. Furthermore, 'process_index_entry' in 'sphinx/util/nodes.py' is involved in processing individual index entries, which could help in identifying and potentially correcting how special characters are handled. These code spans will be crucial in understanding the current handling of index entries and modifying it to prevent the creation of duplicate 'Symbols' sections.",

The search results provided include code in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`, specifically the `IndexEntries` class and its method `create_index`. This method handles the creation of the index, including how entries are grouped and sorted. Notable is the handling of special characters and the sorting logic that could potentially cause the two 'Symbols' sections. This code appears relevant as it involves the core logic of generating the index structure. The `StandaloneHTMLBuilder` class in `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py` is also relevant as it handles the actual HTML generation. The key function here is `write_genindex` which writes the generated index to HTML, suggesting it manages how the index is displayed on the page, potentially including multiple 'Symbols' sections if not managed correctly. The `process_index_entry` function in `sphinx/util/nodes.py` is less directly related as it processes individual index entries before they are grouped and sorted, but it's still conceptually relevant as it determines how entries are initially interpreted and handled.",
