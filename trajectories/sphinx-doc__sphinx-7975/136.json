The reported issue mentions specific characters (_@_, _\u00a3_, _\u2190_) that are causing the duplication. From the search results, it's clear that the `IndexEntries` class in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` is responsible for creating the index. Within this class, the `create_index` method handles the grouping and sorting of index entries, which is likely where the problem lies. Specifically, the sorting logic defined in `keyfunc` and `keyfunc3` should be examined to ensure it correctly categorizes and orders entries, including those with special characters.\n\nThe `IndexEntriesCollector` class in `sphinx/environment/collectors/indexentries.py` is another relevant piece as it collects and processes index entries from the documents. This class could potentially have an impact on how entries are initially handled and passed to the `IndexEntries` class.\n\nLastly, the `HTMLTranslator` class in `sphinx/writers/html.py` deals with the rendering of the index entries into HTML format. The `visit_index` method here could also be a point of interest if HTML rendering issues are suspected. However, based on the issue description, the primary focus should be on the index creation and sorting logic rather than rendering.\n\nBy analyzing these parts of the code, we can identify where the logic for sorting and grouping index entries might be failing to correctly handle the special characters, leading to the creation of multiple 'Symbols' sections.",
