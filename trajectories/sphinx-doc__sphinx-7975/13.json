            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue identifies a problem with the way index entries using special characters (_@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_) are being grouped and displayed in the HTML output. The analysis of the search results shows that the `IndexEntries` class in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` is responsible for creating and handling index entries. The `create_index` method in this class is particularly relevant, as it processes different types of index entries and decides how and where they should be placed in the index. The method sorts entries, including those that are not explicitly handled as special cases (e.g., entries starting with non-alphabetic characters), under a 'Symbols' heading. This suggests that the logic for grouping and sorting index entries based on their initial character might be flawed or needs adjustment to handle specific special characters differently, preventing them from being grouped incorrectly under the 'Symbols' heading. Additionally, the `LaTeXTranslator` class's handling of index entries in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` might also be indirectly relevant, although its primary concern is LaTeX output rather than HTML. The `visit_index` method in this class processes entries based on their type, suggesting a possibility that discrepancies between the processing rules for LaTeX and HTML could contribute to the issue experienced in HTML output. Given the complexity of the method and the need to see more code, it's reasonable to conclude that a deeper review is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue. However, the `IndexEntries` class and its `create_index` method are the most promising starting points for addressing the problem, especially the sorting and grouping logic. Therefore, the search task can be considered incomplete without specific adjustments or more detailed code around the handling of these special characters in the HTML output context.",

The code also includes logic for sorting and grouping entries, which is relevant to the multiple 'Symbols' sections problem. Additionally, the 'split_into' function and the regular expressions used in these methods suggest that they handle the splitting and categorization of index entries, which could be where the issue arises. There is no direct indication in the provided context of a solution or a code change that fixes the issue, but the analysis of these methods and their related functions provides a good starting point for further investigation.

The initial file context provides the 'create_index' method in 'indexentries.py', which contains the logic for grouping index entries and creating the index. The relevant code spans within this method include the 'keyfunc' which handles the sorting and grouping of index entries based on their keys. This keyfunc may need adjustments to correctly handle the special characters and avoid creating duplicate 'Symbols' sections.\n\nAdditional search results provide more context on how the index entries are processed and rendered, especially in the LaTeX writer where they are converted into LaTeX commands. The 'visit_index' method in 'latex.py' specifically handles converting these entries into LaTeX format. This method includes logic to escape characters and format index entries, suggesting that adjustments here may also be necessary to correctly handle special characters.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are:\n1.
