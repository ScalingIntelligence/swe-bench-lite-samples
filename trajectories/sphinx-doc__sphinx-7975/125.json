The relevant code spans appear to be in the 'IndexEntries' class in 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' and in the 'StandaloneHTMLBuilder' class in 'sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py'. The 'create_index' method in 'IndexEntries' handles the creation of the index, and within this method, the logic for adding entries is present. This includes handling different types of entries like 'single', 'pair', 'triple', 'see', and 'seealso'. The code checks the type of each entry and processes it accordingly, including checks for specific characters. Additionally, the 'write_genindex' method in 'StandaloneHTMLBuilder' is responsible for writing the general index, where the logic for handling the split index and generating the index pages is located. This method could also be relevant to the issue, as it interacts with the index entries created by 'IndexEntries'. The analysis is thus focused on identifying the specific parts of the code that manage index creation and HTML generation for the index to determine how the 'Symbols' entries are processed and displayed.",
