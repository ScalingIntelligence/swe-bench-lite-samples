The analysis of the search results reveals several potential areas where this can be addressed. Firstly, the `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` file contains a class `IndexEntries` with a method `create_index` that manipulates index entries and controls their grouping. This method is crucial for the logic that decides how index entries are categorized and displayed. The method includes the logic for handling specific character groups and sorting them into categories. Secondly, the `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py` file includes a `StandaloneHTMLBuilder` class with a `write_genindex` method that writes the generated index entries into HTML. This method is responsible for rendering the index entries, including the 'Symbols' sections. The `sphinx/writers/latex.py` file contains a `LaTeXTranslator` class with a `generate_indices` method, although LaTeX might not be directly related to the HTML output issue, understanding how indices are handled in different formats can provide context. Finally, the `sphinx/builders/singlehtml.py` file contains a `SingleFileHTMLBuilder` class, but its methods seem more focused on a single HTML file layout, which might not be directly relevant to this multiple sections issue.",
