This suggests a problem in how index entries are processed and grouped, particularly when dealing with certain leading characters like _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_. Given the files already identified as potentially relevant, the focus should be on methods and functions related to index creation and entry processing in modules such as 'indexentries.py', 'latex.py', and 'texinfo.py'. Specifically, the 'create_index' method in 'indexentries.py' and 'collect_indices' in 'texinfo.py' are likely points of interest. Additionally, the 'process_index_entry' function in 'util/nodes.py' could be key as it processes individual index entries.",
