The issue identifies specific leading characters (_@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_) that are causing two sections named 'Symbols' to appear, leading to incorrect linking. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the code responsible for generating and organizing index entries, particularly the handling of these special characters. The search results include several relevant files and methods. Most notably, the `IndexEntries.create_index` method in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` directly handles the creation of the index, including key functions like `add_entry` and sorting. This method is likely where the logic for grouping or marking special characters resides. Additionally, the `StandaloneHTMLBuilder.write_genindex` method in `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py` is responsible for writing the generalized index, which is related to the HTML output. Furthermore, the `LaTeXTranslator.generate_indices` method in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` and the `TexinfoTranslator.collect_indices` method in `sphinx/writers/texinfo.py` provide context on how indices are processed for different output formats. Given these findings, it's determined that the identified code spans are likely pertinent to addressing the issue at hand.",
