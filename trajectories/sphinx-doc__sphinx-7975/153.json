The key components to focus on are the grouping and sorting of index entries and how they are handled in the HTML output. The IndexEntries class in 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' appears to be the main class controlling index creation. Within this class, the 'create_index' method is particularly relevant, as it includes sorting and grouping logic for index entries. This method sorts items by a key function, which normalizes the first character of the entry's key. If the first character is not alphabetic or an underline, it categorizes the entry as 'Symbols'. This categorization logic might be causing the double 'Symbols' sections. Additionally, the 'add_entry' method is responsible for adding entries to the index, which could also be relevant for understanding how entries are being processed. Therefore, focusing on these methods should provide insight into why two 'Symbols' sections are being created and how they might be addressed. Conversely, the LaTeXTranslator and TexinfoTranslator classes, while related to documentation output formats, do not directly affect the HTML output and the specific issue at hand, so their relevance is lower.",

The initial file context provided in 'indexentries.py' contains the method 'create_index' which processes index entries, categorizes them, and sorts them. The method uses regex for fixing entries and sorts them based on specific conditions related to alphabetic and special characters.\n\nThe search results introduce two new files: 'html.py' and 'nodes.py'. In 'html.py', the 'HTMLTranslator' class is significant as it deals with generating HTML content, specifically methods 'get_secnumber' and 'add_permalink_ref' which handle section numbers and permalinks. These could be related to how the 'Symbols' sections are handled and linked in the output.\n\nIn 'nodes.py', the 'process_index_entry' function processes individual index entries, categorizing them based on the type of entry. This directly correlates with how entries are handled before they are passed to the 'create_index' method in 'indexentries.py'. This function could potentially contribute to the issue by not properly sorting or categorizing entries with special characters like '@', '\u00a3', and '\u2190'.\n\nGiven the context, the identified spans of code in 'indexentries.py', 'html.py', and 'nodes.py' are relevant to the reported issue, as they cover the creation of index entries, their translation into HTML, and the processing of individual entries, respectively.",

The sorting function 'keyfunc' uses normalization of keys to handle different characters, including special symbols like _@_, that could lead to multiple 'Symbols' sections. The code also sorts entries with specified category keys or separates characters into 'Symbols' if they're not alphabetic or _. The 'sphinx/writers/html.py' file includes methods for handling section numbers and adding permalinks, which could impact how sections are displayed. Additionally, the 'sphinx/util/nodes.py' file includes the 'process_index_entry' function, which processes individual index entries and categorizes them based on their types.
