The issue primarily concerns the handling of specific characters in the index entries. Relevant files may include those dealing with index creation, HTML writing, and possibly LaTeX and Texinfo writing, as they involve the generation of indices or handling special characters in the output.

The goal is to identify code spans in the provided search results that are relevant to this issue. The LaTeXTranslator class in 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' is likely relevant, as it contains methods for generating indices and handling index entries. The create_index method in 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' is another key piece of code, as it processes index entries and determines their placement, which could influence how sections are categorized and displayed. The TexinfoTranslator class in 'sphinx/writers/texinfo.py' is also examined, but it appears less directly related to the specific issue as it focuses on generating Texinfo format documentation, not HTML. The identified code spans in LaTeXTranslator and IndexEntries are significant as they handle index generation and categorization, which aligns with the issue's concern about index entry display in HTML output. These spans include the escape function for handling special characters, the generation of indices, and the creation of the index itself. This analysis suggests that the issue might be related to how special characters are processed when generating HTML from the index entries, possibly due to differences in handling between LaTeX and HTML output formats.",

However, the current implementation of `visit_index` simply raises a `SkipNode`, which suggests that the detailed handling of index entries is taking place elsewhere or the feature for handling index entries directly in the HTML translator has been temporarily bypassed. Given that the LaTeX handling for index entries is sophisticated, involving escape mechanisms for special characters, the next logical step would be to revisit the `IndexEntries.create_index` method in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`. This crucial method prepares the index entries for all outputs, potentially setting the stage for how special characters are managed in all output formats, including HTML. The strategy key might already be implemented there for handling special characters effectively, which would inform how these characters should be treated specially when converting to HTML. Therefore, the focus should shift back to refining the handling of these characters at the index creation stage, possibly with adaptations made later within the HTML context.",

Two primary components come into play: the `IndexEntries.create_index` method and the LaTeXTranslator for the generation of indices. The `create_index` method is critical as it handles the creation of index entries and their sorting. The method uses a series of key functions to determine the grouping and sorting of index entries. For symbols like _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_, they might be sorted under the 'Symbols' category, which could explain the appearance of multiple 'Symbols' sections. To address this, it would be beneficial to examine how these characters are treated in the sorting logic. In particular, the keyfunc3 function, which determines the category, might place these specific characters in a way that leads to duplicates. To fix this, we might need to adjust the category assignment logic to avoid duplicates. For now, the identified relevant code spans are those that deal with the creation and sorting of index entries. Additional investigation might be needed to fully understand how these specific characters are processed and how to prevent the duplication issue.",

Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n"
