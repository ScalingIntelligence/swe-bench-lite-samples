This method is responsible for creating the index entries and sorting them. Specifically, the issue might be related to the categorization logic in the `keyfunc3` function within the `create_index` method, where entries are sorted and grouped under 'Symbols' based on their first character. Additionally, the `write_genindex` method in the `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py` file, which is part of the `StandaloneHTMLBuilder` class, handles the writing of the generated index to HTML.

The issue likely stems from how these special characters are being grouped and categorized within this method.
