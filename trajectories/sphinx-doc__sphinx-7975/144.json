The 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' file appears relevant due to its handling of index creation, particularly the 'IndexEntries.create_index' method, which sorts and groups index entries. Initial inspection suggests the method organizes entries alphabetically and uses Unicode normalization. Differences in key handling for special characters like _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_ might cause the reported issue where 'Symbols' sections are duplicated. Further inspection of how entries are added and sorted in this method would likely reveal the cause or the necessary adjustments for an accurate solution. Regarding 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' and 'sphinx/writers/texinfo.py', they lack direct involvement in index sorting logic and are more focused on various output formats' generation or adoption directives from the environment rather than on the organization of the indexes. Their focus is more on adapting the report to different language options or special instructions settings rather than on the subject of symbols' insertion and differentiation.",

The '_fixre' regex is used to reformat specific patterns of entries, but it appears not to handle special characters directly but rather adjusts entries for better formatting structurally. The 'keyfunc0', 'keyfunc2', and 'keyfunc3' functions manage the sorting of entries, including alphabetic order and symbols processing. Based on these observations, further exploration is necessary regarding how specialty characters are dealt with during these sorting stages and how the grouping process categorizes the entries for output.",

Yet, the specific issue of creating distinct sections for different sets of special characters ('@', '\u00a3', '\u2190') and the handling of their order remains unclear from the current context.
