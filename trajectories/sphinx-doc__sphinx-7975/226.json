The provided code snippet from 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' implements the 'create_index' method, which is responsible for processing and organizing index entries. This method seems to handle various types of index entries (single, pair, triple, see, seealso) and categorizes them based on their first character using 'keyfunc3'. The key functions here are 'keyfunc3', which determines the category based on the first character, and the sorting logic in 'keyfunc2' and 'keyfunc0'. Given the issue description, it is likely that these functions need to be adjusted to handle special characters properly and avoid duplicate 'Symbols' sections. The relevant spans seem to be those where the key functions are defined and implemented, as well as the overall logic for adding entries and grouping them.",
