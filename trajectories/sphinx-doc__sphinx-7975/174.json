This class is responsible for translating the documentation into HTML format, which is where the issue appears. Specifically, the `visit_index` method in this class is of particular interest because it handles how index entries are processed during HTML generation. The StandaloneHTMLBuilder class in `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py` is another relevant part as it deals with the HTML build process, and its `write_genindex` method involves creating the index pages, which could also be related to the duplication issue if the logic for handling special characters is flawed or duplicated somewhere in the process. Given these factors, I've identified critical methods in both classes that are likely involved in the issue.",

Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n"
