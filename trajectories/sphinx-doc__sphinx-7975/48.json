To address this, it's crucial to understand how the index entries are processed and grouped. The search results provide insights into how index entries are managed in the Sphinx documentation tool, specifically in the IndexEntries class within 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py'. This class contains methods for creating indices and organizing index entries, which directly relate to the problem. The relevant parts include the 'create_index' method, which processes different types of index entries and organizes them into categories. This method could be modified to handle the special characters '_@_', '_\u00a3_', and '_\u2190_' differently, preventing the creation of multiple 'Symbols' sections. Additionally, the 'TexinfoTranslator' class in 'sphinx/writers/texinfo.py' is also relevant as it deals with how indices are collected and processed for output formats like Texinfo. Although it doesn't directly create the HTML output, understanding how indices are processed in different formats might provide insight into how to fix the HTML output issue. Overall, the identified code spans are relevant because they demonstrate how index entries are handled, which is critical for resolving the issue of multiple 'Symbols' sections.",
