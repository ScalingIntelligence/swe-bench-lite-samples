The search results within 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' provide the method 'create_index' which is responsible for generating index entries and sorting logic. This method includes sorting and categorization of keys, which suggests it handles the logic for grouping and ordering index entries. Specifically, the sorting key function 'keyfunc' uses special handling for keys starting with alpha characters or '_', which is directly relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the method also handles grouping of entries which might relate to the duplication issue. Another relevant section within the same file is the use of 'add_entry' function which defines how entries are added to the dictionary, potentially where the handling of special characters could be implemented or be impacted. On the other hand, 'sphinx/writers/html.py' contains the 'visit_index' method in the 'HTMLTranslator' class, which is related to the HTML output of index nodes. Although it does not directly implement the index logic, it intersects with the HTML representation of indices, which suggests monitoring for potential side-effects on the HTML output as per the reported issue.",
