The issue describes that these entries are getting grouped under two 'Symbols' sections in the HTML output, with duplicate anchors causing navigation to direct to the wrong section. Analyzing the provided search results from 'indexentries.py', the code in 'IndexEntries.create_index' is particularly relevant. This method seems responsible for processing and categorizing index entries based on their prefixes and sorting them accordingly. Specifically, the 'keyfunc' used in sorting entries appears to handle the categorization by normalizing keys and grouping non-alphabetic entries under a 'Symbols' category. Therefore, modifying or investigating this sorting and categorization logic is likely necessary to resolve the issue. Additionally, the 'HTMLTranslator' in 'html.py' needs to be reviewed for correct handling and rendering of these categories to prevent duplicate 'Symbols' entries in the HTML output. No significant code snippets were found in 'latex.py' that directly address the reported issue, thus its utilization is minimal for addressing this issue.",
