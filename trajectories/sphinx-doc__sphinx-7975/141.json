Both sections have the same anchor in HTML, leading to confusion with the links. To address this, we should focus on the code related to index generation and management in the HTML output. The provided context points to several files that might be relevant, such as those handling index entries, LaTeX, TeXinfo, and HTML builders. Specifically, we need to look at how index entries are processed and grouped in the HTML output.",

This issue is likely related to the way index entries are processed and grouped during the HTML building process. The search results provide several relevant code spans that are involved in generating indices and processing index entries. These include methods such as `collect_indices` in `TexinfoTranslator`, `generate_indices` in `LaTeXTranslator`, and `create_index` in `IndexEntries`. The `visit_index` method in `LaTeXTranslator` is also relevant as it deals with escaping certain characters, which could influence how entries are grouped. Additionally, the `StandaloneHTMLBuilder` class and its methods `prepare_writing` and `write_genindex` are crucial as they are directly involved in preparing and writing the HTML output for the index, potentially where the duplication issue occurs. The `HTMLTranslator` class and its `visit_index` method should also be examined as it controls how index nodes are translated into HTML, which could further illuminate how the _Symbols_ sections are being generated and duplicated. Overall, these code spans collectively provide a comprehensive view of the index processing pipeline, which is essential for diagnosing and resolving the duplication issue described in the reported issue.",

These files include code responsible for generating indices in various output formats, such as LaTeX, Texinfo, HTML, and others. The specific methods of interest are those related to generating indices and managing index entries, such as `generate_indices`, `visit_index`, and `create_index`. The issue likely arises from the way these methods categorize and generate index entries for special characters like '@', '\u00a3', and '\u2190'. By examining `create_index` in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`, it's clear that this method is responsible for generating index entries based on different types (like 'single', 'pair', 'triple', 'see', and 'seealso'). The sorting and categorization of these entries into sections are key here. The reported issue might indicate a bug or configuration problem in how these special characters are handled in the indexing process. Further analysis is needed to pinpoint where the logic for generating indices fails to differentiate between '@' and the other characters, leading to two different sections being erroneously named 'Symbols'.",

The issue specifically mentions handling index entries with leading characters such as _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_. It also points out a problem with two 'Symbols' sections and the same HTML anchor leading to both sections. I then reviewed the relevant parts of the file context. The portions of the code related to index generation and handling are found in `sphinx/writers/texinfo.py`, `sphinx/writers/latex.py`, and `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`. Specifically, I focused on the `generate_indices` method in `sphinx/writers/latex.py`. This method handles the generation of index entries, which is directly related to the report of multiple 'Symbols' sections. I then proceeded to analyze the new search results. Among these, the `sphinx/writers/latex.py` file contains the relevant `generate_indices` method. This method is crucial for understanding how index generation occurs and how entries such as those starting with _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_ are treated. This section further elaborates on how index entries are processed and makes me confident that this is the source of the issue since it handles how entries are classified and grouped. Based on the analysis, I can confirm that the provided search results, specifically `sphinx/writers/latex.py` and its `generate_indices` method, are relevant to the reported issue. It is hence logical to return these identified spans as relevant.",
