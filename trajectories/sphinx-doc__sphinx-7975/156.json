The problem arises with specific leading characters (_@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_).\n\nCurrent Context Review: No relevant code has been identified yet.\n\nAnalyzing New Search Results:\n- Examined 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' for relevant code spans dealing with index creation and handling of special characters or symbols. Noticed the 'IndexEntries.create_index' method where special characters and symbols might be processed.\n- Reviewed 'sphinx/writers/texinfo.py' for any clues on how indices are collected and generated. Found the 'TexinfoTranslator.collect_indices' method that could be related to the collection of index entries.\n- Inspected 'sphinx/writers/html.py' for HTML translation of indices. Found the 'HTMLTranslator.visit_index' method, which suggests that this part of the code handles how indices are presented in HTML. However, it raises a 'SkipNode' exception, which might not directly solve the issue but indicates where the handling for the index might start.\n\nConclusions:\n- The 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' file seems to contain the core logic where index entries, including those with special characters, are managed. Specifically, the 'create_index' method is a prime candidate for containing the code causing the duplicate sections.\n- The 'sphinx/writers/html.py' file indicates where the HTML output of indices, including any potential duplication handling, might be determined. However, the 'SkipNode' exception in the 'visit_index' method suggests something intended but not implemented here, potentially pointing towards the area needing attention.\n- The 'sphinx/writers/texinfo.py' file, while not directly related to the HTML issue, provides insight into how indices are processed in general in Sphinx, which could be useful for context in resolving the reported issue.\n\nFrom these insights, the primary focus for addressing the issue of duplicate 'Symbols' sections in the HTML index lies within the 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' and 'sphinx/writers/html.py' files. It's likely that addressing or examining code related to special character handling and HTML presentation in these files will be crucial.",
