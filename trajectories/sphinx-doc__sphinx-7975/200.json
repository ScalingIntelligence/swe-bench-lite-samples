The search results provide relevant code spans that could be handling the index entry creation and formatting.

Within 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py', the 'IndexEntries.create_index' method is critical as it sorts and groups entries. The regex '_fixre' and the sorting logic could affect how entries are grouped and presented, potentially leading to the duplicated 'Symbols' sections.\n4. The 'sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py' file and its 'StandaloneHTMLBuilder.write_genindex' method appear to be where the generation of the HTML index pages happens, including how to handle a split index situation which could be related to the issue.\n5. The 'sphinx/writers/html.py' file, especially 'HTMLTranslator.visit_index' could determine how index entries are transformed into HTML and how links to these entries are managed, particularly relevant if it decides to skip nodes (links) used for indexing.\n6.
