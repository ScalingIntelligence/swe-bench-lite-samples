The method `create_index` looks particularly relevant as it processes entries and organizes them into a structured index format.

Additionally, the `process_index_entry` function in 'sphinx/util/nodes.py' is responsible for processing individual index entries, which includes handling the character symbols mentioned in the issue. Therefore, these sections are likely the ones contributing to the bug in how the 'Symbols' sections are handled.
