The key function to analyze is `IndexEntries.create_index`, which constructs the index from the entries provided. This function includes logic for handling different types of index entries and sorting them into categories. The presence of separate sections for specific characters suggests that the sorting mechanism might be overly sensitive to these characters, leading to multiple 'Symbols' sections. Additionally, the `StandaloneHTMLBuilder.write_genindex` method is responsible for writing the generated index to HTML, and it uses `IndexEntries.create_index` to get the index entries before formatting them for output. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that handle the creation and sorting of index entries and the writing of the index to HTML.",

Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n"
