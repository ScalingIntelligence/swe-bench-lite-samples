This results in two 'Symbols' links in the index page, both leading to the first section. This problem likely involves the logic for grouping or sorting index entries in the HTML output.

This suggests a problem in how index entries are processed and how the HTML output is generated. The provided search results include relevant code spans that handle index entries and the generation of the HTML index. Specifically, the 'process_index_entry' function in 'sphinx/util/nodes.py' processes index entries and determines their placement and type. Additionally, the 'write_genindex' method in 'StandaloneHTMLBuilder' class within 'sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py' is responsible for writing the general index to HTML, including how entries are grouped and rendered. These spans appear to be directly related to the reported issue, focusing on index processing and HTML output generation. Further analysis of how these functions handle the leading characters ('_@_', '_\u00a3_, '_\u2190_') specifically would be necessary to fully address the issue, but based on the current context and search results, these spans are relevant.",
