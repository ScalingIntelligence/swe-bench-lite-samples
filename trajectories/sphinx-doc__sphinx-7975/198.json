The method 'generate_indices' in 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' processes index content and formats it, potentially where the duplicate sections issue arises. Furthermore, 'sphinx/util/nodes.py' contains the 'process_index_entry' function that processes individual index entries and could be contributing to the issue if there's a lack of distinction for these special characters during processing.

The specific handling of characters like @, \u00a3, and \u2190 isn't explicitly addressed in the provided snippet of the 'create_index' method, but it is evident that the method processes entries and groups them based on the leading character or prefix. The key function used for sorting and grouping entries, 'keyfunc3', significantly influences how entries are grouped and presented in the final index. The function appears to categorize entries under 'Symbols' if they do not start with an alphabetic character or underscore.",
