This issue likely involves the generation and rendering of index entries in the HTML builder. The provided code spans suggest several potential points of interest: 1. LaTeXTranslator's `generate_indices` method is involved in generating index entries for LaTeX, potentially relevant due to similarities in index handling between LaTeX and HTML. 2. IndexEntries' `create_index` method directly deals with the creation of index entries, making it a prime candidate for the issue. 3. StandaloneHTMLBuilder's `write_genindex` method is responsible for writing the general index in HTML, a crucial step in the HTML output process. The search results include several other transforms and translators, but they do not directly handle the index entries or the creation of HTML output. Focusing on the HTML builder and the creation of index entries seems most relevant to address the issue.",
