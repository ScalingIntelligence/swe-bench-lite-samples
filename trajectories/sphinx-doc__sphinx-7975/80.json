The 'IndexEntries' class and its methods ('create_index') appear to handle the creation and grouping of index entries. The sorting and grouping logic within 'create_index' seem to be the most relevant to address the issue of multiple 'Symbols' sections and their incorrect grouping. The key functions 'keyfunc', 'keyfunc2', and 'keyfunc3' within 'create_index' are particularly relevant as they handle the sorting and categorization of the index entries. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",
