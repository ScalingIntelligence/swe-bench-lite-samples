This behavior seems to be caused by the logic in the `create_index` method of the `IndexEntries` class in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`. This method sorts and groups index entries, and it has logic that categorizes entries starting with symbols under a 'Symbols' heading. However, it appears to handle certain symbols differently, leading to the creation of separate 'Symbols' sections. The `process_index_entry` function in `sphinx/util/nodes.py` also processes index entries and might contribute to how these entries are categorized and displayed. Given these code spans, modifications would need to be made in the `create_index` method to ensure that all symbol-based entries fall under a single 'Symbols' section.",
