Based on the search results, the relevant code spans are found in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` and `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`. In `sphinx/writers/latex.py`, the `LaTeXTranslator` class contains the `generate_indices` and `visit_index` methods, which are likely responsible for generating the indices and visiting index nodes respectively. These methods handle the formatting and escape characters related to index entries, including special characters as indicated by the 'escape' function in `visit_index`. Similarly, in `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py`, the `IndexEntries` class contains the `create_index` method, which processes the index entries and organizes them into categories. This method includes logic for handling different types of index entries and could be where the duplication issue originates. Other files such as `sphinx/writers/texinfo.py`, `sphinx/writers/text.py`, `sphinx/writers/manpage.py`, and `sphinx/writers/html.py` contain `visit_index` methods but do not seem to directly address the character-specific issues mentioned in the report and thus are not as relevant. Therefore, the focus should be on the identified spans within `sphinx/writers/latex.py` and `sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py` for solving the duplication issue.",
