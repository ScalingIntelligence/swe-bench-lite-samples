This suggests a need to review the logic in the index creation and grouping process. Upon reviewing the code in 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py', the 'IndexEntries.create_index' method is particularly relevant. This method handles the creation of index entries and their grouping. It includes functions for adding entries, sorting them, and grouping them into sections. The logic for determining the section headings for index entries, including special characters, is found in the 'keyfunc3' function, which normalizes the keys and assigns them to 'Symbols' if they are not alphabetic or underscore. Based on the issue, it seems the normalization or sorting logic might need adjustment to avoid duplicate 'Symbols' sections. Therefore, the relevant code spans to investigate further are the 'create_index' method and the 'keyfunc3' function.",

Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.\n\n"
