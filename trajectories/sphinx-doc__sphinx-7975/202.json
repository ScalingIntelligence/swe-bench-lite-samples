This problem seems to be related to the way index entries with specific leading characters (_@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_) are handled. The initial inspection of the code base suggests that the problem could stem from the index processing logic, particularly in how entries are grouped and categorized. I will focus my search on the 'create_index' method in 'sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py' and the 'visit_index' method in 'sphinx/writers/latex.py', as these are likely places where the index entries are being managed and formatted for output.",

The <IndexEntries.create_index> span in sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py appears to handle the creation of index entries, including how they are grouped and sorted. This includes logic to sort entries into categories like 'Symbols' based on their leading characters. The issue might arise from how this sorting logic treats special characters and 'normal' words, potentially leading to the creation of two 'Symbols' sections. Additionally, <LaTeXTranslator.visit_index> in sphinx/writers/latex.py handles the rendering of index entries in LaTeX, but the issue specifically pertains to HTML output. Therefore, the focus should mainly be on <IndexEntries.create_index> for addressing the duplicate sections issue. Both code spans are relevant because they affect how index entries are processed and how sections are named and grouped.",

The logic for categorizing entries into 'Symbols' or other sections is present here. The 'keyfunc' function determines the categorization based on the first character of the index entry, which likely leads to the creation of two 'Symbols' sections. The 'visit_index' method in 'sphinx/writers/latex.py' also processes these entries but focuses on LaTeX output formatting rather than categorization.
