This suggests that the issue lies in the interaction between `FilteredRelation` and the query mechanism, potentially in the way the query is built or how related objects are fetched. The analysis of the search results reveals several key areas that could be relevant:\n\n1. **django/db/models/sql/query.py** - This file contains the `Query` class with methods such as `build_filtered_relation_q` and `add_filtered_relation`. These methods are directly involved in handling the `FilteredRelation` and could be crucial in understanding how the filtering and query construction interact.\n\n2. **django/db/models/query_utils.py** - Here, the `FilteredRelation` class itself is defined. Its `__init__` method and `as_sql` method, which involves query compilation, could provide insights into how the filtering condition is applied.\n\n3. **django/db/models/fields/related.py** - This file contains the `RelatedField` class and its methods like `get_forward_related_filter` and `get_reverse_related_filter`, which manage the fetching of related objects. Their interaction with the `FilteredRelation` could affect how related objects are set.\n\n4. **django/db/models/sql/compiler.py** - The `SQLCompiler` class and its method `get_related_selections` handle the compilation of SQL for related selections. This process might involve the correct application of `FilteredRelation` and thus could be a source of the issue.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the nature of the problem, these areas of the codebase appear to be highly relevant for understanding and potentially resolving the issue.
