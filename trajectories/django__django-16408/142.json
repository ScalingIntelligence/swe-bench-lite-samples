These files contain classes and methods that are crucial for handling SQL compilation, related object descriptors, and query construction, respectively.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the method 'get_related_selections' directly deals with related fields and could potentially be the source of the issue related to incorrect object assignment or selection. The detailed logic here could help in understanding how related objects are fetched and selected, which is critical to the reported issue.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py', multiple classes handling different types of relationships (e.g., 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor', 'ForwardOneToOneDescriptor') are found. These are likely to be involved in how related objects are handled in Django ORM. The methods 'get_prefetch_queryset' and 'get_object' here could be pivotal in understanding the incorrect assignment reported.\n\nIn 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', the 'Query' class and specifically the 'add_filtered_relation' method deal with adding and managing filtered relations.
