The error is observed in the context of Django's ORM, specifically when handling related objects and prefetching. The relevant code spans likely involve the SQLCompiler class, related descriptors, and the Query class. To debug this issue, it would be beneficial to investigate the get_related_selections method in SQLCompiler, the get_prefetch_queryset and get_object methods in ForwardManyToOneDescriptor, and the add_filtered_relation method in Query. Additionally, exploring the prefetch_related_objects function and RelatedPopulator class in the query module might reveal the root cause of the problem.",
