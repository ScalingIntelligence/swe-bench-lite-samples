The test case is located in `known_related_objects.tests.ExistingRelatedInstancesTests.test_wrong_select_related`. To resolve this, we need to investigate the inner workings of the `Prefetch` class (if applicable) and how Django handles filtered relations and select-related operations. We should focus on the `sql.compiler`, `fields.related_descriptors`, `sql.query`, and `query` modules, as these are likely to contain functions and methods that manage related objects' operations, specifically `get_related_selections`, `get_prefetch_queryset`, `get_object`, `add_filtered_relation`, `prefetch_related_objects`, `RelatedPopulator.populate`, and `get_related_populators`. These functions are crucial for understanding and fixing the bug related to select_related() and FilteredRelation.",
