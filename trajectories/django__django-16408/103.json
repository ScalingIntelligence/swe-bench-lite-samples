This is evidenced by a test case that fails in the Django codebase. The issue relates to understanding and handling the interactions between `FilteredRelation` and `select_related` in Django's ORM. The search results provided contain relevant code spans from `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.\n\nIn `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, the `SQLCompiler` class and its `get_related_selections` method appear to handle the selection of related fields and the construction of SQL queries to fetch related objects. This includes handling filtered relations and setting up joins to access related data.\n\nIn `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, there are definitions for the `Query` class and its methods, which manage the state of a SQL query and handle the logic for filtered relations. The `add_filtered_relation` method specifically deals with adding a filtered relation to a query and validating the relation conditions.\n\nThese code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue as they involve the core functionality of handling and joining related fields, including dealing with filtered relations. The `get_related_selections` method in `SQLCompiler` and the `add_filtered_relation` method in `Query` will be particularly useful for debugging and potentially fixing the issue related to the incorrect setting of related objects when using `FilteredRelation` with `select_related`. While the full extent of the issue is yet to be determined, these code spans provide a solid starting point for addressing the reported bug.\n\nBased on the analysis, the provided code spans are significant for addressing the issue and should be further investigated in the context of resolving the reported problem with multi-level `FilteredRelation` and `select_related`.",
