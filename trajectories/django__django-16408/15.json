This indicates a potential problem with how Django handles related object selection and caching in complex queries. To address this, we need to examine the code responsible for managing these relationships and the caching mechanisms. The search results focus on key components like SQLCompiler for query compilation, ForwardManyToOneDescriptor for managing forward relations, and Query for constructing queries. The identified spans, 'SQLCompiler.get_related_selections' and 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset', seem particularly relevant as they handle related selections and prefetching, which are critical for the issue at hand.
