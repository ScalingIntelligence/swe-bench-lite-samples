To address this issue, we need to focus on the code handling FilteredRelation and select_related functionality. The search results include significant sections of the Query class from django/db/models/sql/query.py, which are likely relevant to the issue. \n\nWithin the Query class, the `add_filtered_relation` method is crucial, as it manages the conditions and aliases for FilteredRelations. The method ensures that the relation name does not contain lookups and that conditions support relations within the specified relation name. This method directly relates to the setup used in the test case and could likely contain the bug causing the wrong related object to be set.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified code spans include the entire `Query` class, particularly the `add_filtered_relation` method. These spans should help in diagnosing and fixing the issue reported.",
