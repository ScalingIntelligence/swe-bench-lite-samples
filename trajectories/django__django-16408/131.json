The test case provided specifies the use of FilteredRelation, annotate, and select_related, which are key elements for identifying relevant code spans. The search results contain several relevant spans across different files within the Django codebase. The identified spans include methods and classes pertaining to SQL compilation, query processing, and related object handling such as 'SQLCompiler.get_related_selections' and 'Query.add_filtered_relation'. These are critical for understanding how related selections are processed and how filtered relations are added to a query. Furthermore, descriptors like 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor' and 'ReverseOneToOneDescriptor' in 'related_descriptors.py' are essential as they handle many-to-one and one-to-one relationships, respectively, which are directly related to multi-level relations and select_related functionality. The 'prefetch_related_objects' and 'RelatedPopulator' functions in 'query.py' are also relevant as they manage the prefetching and population of related objects, which intersect with the functionality affected by the reported issue. Overall, the identified spans cover the necessary components to address the reported issue, potentially leading to a solution or further insight into the bug.",
