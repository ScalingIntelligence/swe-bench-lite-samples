Specifically, it highlights a test case where the tournament_pool attribute in PoolStyle objects should reference a Tournament instance but it is incorrectly referencing a PoolStyle instance. This discrepancy in expected and actual values indicates a deeper issue in the prefetching or related object resolution logic.\n\nGiven the search results, there are several potentially relevant code spans within the QuerySet class and related utility functions that deal with prefetching related objects. These functions (_iterator, _prefetch_related_objects, normalize_prefetch_lookups, and prefetch_related_objects) are crucial for understanding how Django handles hierarchical related object retrieval.\n\nThe _prefetch_related_objects method and prefetch_related_objects function are directly responsible for prefetching objects, which could be an entry point for the issue described. The normalize_prefetch_lookups function ensures that prefetch lookups are correctly configured before execution. Furthermore, the logic within the while loop inside prefetch_related_objects handles the traversal and fetching of related objects, which could include the multi-level traversal causing the reported error.\n\nThus, these segments of the code are relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the issue with multi-level FilteredRelation and select_related().",
