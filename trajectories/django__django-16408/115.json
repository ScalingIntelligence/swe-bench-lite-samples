This suggests that the issue lies in the management and handling of related objects within Django's ORM. Upon examining the provided code spans, the most relevant code appears to be in the `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` file, specifically the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` class and its methods `get_prefetch_queryset` and `get_object`. These methods deal directly with fetching and setting related objects, which is likely where the error in the reported issue originates. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and its method `get_related_selections` may also be involved in managing or triggering the issue due to its handling of related selections in SQL compilation. However, the primary focus should be on the descriptors in `related_descriptors.py` as they directly interface with the objects being managed and could be where the logic for handling these related objects incorrectly is implemented. This analysis suggests that these two files and their specific methods are the most relevant for debugging and fixing the reported issue.",

The test case provided in the issue involves annotating and select_related on a related field 'tournament_pool' which should link back to the original tournament through 'pool.tournament'. However, it fails due to an AssertionError indicating that the tournament objects do not match. To address this issue, we need to look at the relevant parts of Django's ORM and SQL query compilation that handle FilteredRelation and select_related functionality, specifically focusing on how related objects are fetched and annotated in multi-level relationships. The search results show several key spans from the Django codebase where FilteredRelation and select_related functionality is implemented and used. These spans include 'add_filtered_relation' in 'Query' class, 'get_related_selections' in 'SQLCompiler' class, and the 'QuerySet' class methods for prefetching related objects. These are crucial for understanding how the ORM handles complex related object retrievals and annotations, and thus are relevant to the reported issue.",

Additionally, the `Query` class and its `add_filtered_relation` method are directly relevant as they handle the filtered relations that are central to the test case provided in the issue. The `QuerySet` class, which provides the high-level API for querying models, is also in the context.
