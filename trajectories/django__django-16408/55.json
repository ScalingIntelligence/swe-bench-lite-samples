This could be due to the way related selections are being handled in the SQLCompiler or how related objects are being prefetched and populated. The relevant code spans provided suggest that the code might be found in the SQLCompiler, ForwardManyToOneDescriptor, or Query class, as well as in functions related to prefetching and populating related objects. To investigate this issue further, I will focus on searching for the usage and implementation of these classes and functions.",

SQLCompiler's `get_related_selections()` is responsible for handling related selections in queries. 2. SQLCompiler's `get_select()` is used to get the select part of the SQL query, which is crucial for understanding how related fields are selected. 3. Query's `add_filtered_relation()` is directly related to adding a filtered relation to the query, which is central to the issue. 4. ForwardManyToOneDescriptor's `get_prefetch_queryset()` deals with prefetching related objects, which could be involved in the problematic behavior if it interacts with select_related().
