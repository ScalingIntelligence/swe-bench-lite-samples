From the error trace, it appears that the mismatch occurs in how the related objects are fetched and aligned. The trace suggests that the related objects from the base query (pool.tournament) and the annotated FilteredRelation (tournament_pool.tournament) are not matching. Given the context, it's likely that the underlying issue could be in the handling or merging of these related objects during the SQL compilation or query execution phases. Thus, the search should focus on the specific functions and methods involved in handling these relations within the Django ORM, specifically around the SQLCompiler class, the get_related_selections method, and potentially the query.py file where FilteredRelation is added and managed. The ForwardManyToOneDescriptor class and its associated methods such as get_prefetch_queryset and get_object might also be relevant as they handle direct and related object fetching, prefetching, and population.",

The relevant code for this is found in the handling of related fields and setting up joins. The specific section that needs modification is where the related klass infos are appended and joins are set up.",
