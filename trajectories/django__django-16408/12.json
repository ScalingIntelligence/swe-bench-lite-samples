From the search results, the `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` method contains the logic for processing `select_related` and `FilteredRelation`, which is directly relevant to the reported issue. The method handles the recursion and setup of joins for `select_related`, which is essential for understanding how `FilteredRelation` interacts with it.
