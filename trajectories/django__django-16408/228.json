This is evident in the provided test case and failed assertion. The search results provided several key sections of code that are likely relevant to addressing this issue:\n\n1. `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`: This method is responsible for selecting related objects and appears to handle the logic for determining which related objects should be included in a query.\n\n2. `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset` in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`: This method is involved in handling the prefetching of related objects, which might affect the accuracy of the related objects set by `select_related()`.\n\n3. `Query.add_filtered_relation` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`: This method is responsible for handling the addition of filtered relations, a feature that seems critical to the reported issue.\n\n4. `prefetch_related_objects` in `django/db/models/query.py`: This function is concerned with the prefetching of related objects and serves a similar purpose to `select_related()`, making it a likely candidate for containing the root cause or a relevant part of the solution.\n\nGiven the scope of the reported issue and the functionalities these code sections deal with, it is likely that they will be necessary to address the issue of the wrong related object being set. These sections should form the basis for further investigation and potential fixes.\n\nHowever, the exact root cause within these sections would need further examination and debugging, and it is possible that additional relevant code exists within these sections that was not provided in the search results. The provided search results are thus considered relevant and sufficient to initiate addressing the reported issue.",
