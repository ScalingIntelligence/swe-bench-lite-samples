The 'get_prefetch_queryset' and 'get_object' methods in these classes are key, as they handle the actual fetching of related objects and may be where the incorrect assignments occur. Additionally, the Query class in query.py, particularly the 'add_filtered_relation' method, is pivotal for understanding how filtered relations are added to the query and might influence the selection of related objects. Further scrutiny of these methods in relation to the issue at hand is warranted to determine the exact cause of the incorrect assignments.",
