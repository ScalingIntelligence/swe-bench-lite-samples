The provided search results include several relevant code spans across different files in the Django codebase that deal with the `SQLCompiler`, `RawQuerySet`, `prefetch_related_objects`, and `Query` classes. These sections handle various aspects of query compilation, prefetching, and relation handling, all of which are central to the issue at hand. Specifically, the `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` method is directly involved in managing how related objects are selected and set, making it a key piece of code to examine in relation to the reported problem. Additionally, the `Query.add_filtered_relation` method, which deals with adding filtered relations to a query, could also be relevant, as it might affect how relations are processed in the context of the issue.",

The 'Query' class in 'query.py' also plays a crucial role in the management of filtered relations and query construction.
