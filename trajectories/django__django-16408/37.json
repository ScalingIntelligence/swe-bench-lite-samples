This suggests a need to examine how Django handles related object selection and filtering, particularly in complex queries. The relevant sections of Django's codebase that deal with these functionalities include the 'SQLCompiler' class in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', which is responsible for compiling SQL queries, and methods like 'get_related_selections' which manage the selection of related objects. Additionally, 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor' and 'ForwardOneToOneDescriptor' in 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py' are key as they handle the descriptor access to related objects. The 'Query' class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is also relevant for understanding how filtered relations and their conditions are added to queries. Furthermore, 'prefetch_related_objects' in 'django/db/models/query.py' is essential for understanding prefetching mechanisms which might relate to the issue at hand.

This includes correctly setting up joins and selections based on `FilteredRelation` specifications. Specifically, adjust the method logic to account for nested `FilteredRelation` relationships when generating related selections, ensuring that nested relationships are correctly parsed and mapped to their parent objects.\n\nThe `get_related_selections` method needs to be updated to handle `FilteredRelation` objects correctly, especially concerning nested relationships. The necessary modifications include updating the logic that deals with setting up joins and selections based on nested `FilteredRelation` specifications. The required changes are primarily within the loop that processes `opts.fields` and the subsequent handling of `related_objects`, as well as the inclusion of logic for `FilteredRelation` objects within the `requested` field processing.",
