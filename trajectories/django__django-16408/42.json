The test case provided is focused on ensuring that the related objects match between different levels of the hierarchy. Upon examining the search results, several key sections of code are identified that are relevant to the issue at hand. The 'SQLCompiler.get_related_selections' method within 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' contains logic for handling the selection of related objects, including the handling of FilteredRelation and select_related. This method is critical for understanding how the related objects are selected and joined across multiple levels. Additionally, the 'Query.add_filtered_relation' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is relevant as it deals with the addition of filtered relations to a query, which directly correlates to the issue of ensuring the correct related objects are set. The 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset' and 'ReverseOneToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset' methods in 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py' are also pertinent, as they handle the prefetching of related objects, which could influence how related objects are accessed and cached.

The code should ensure that the related object is correctly set, aligning with the expected behavior in the test case.\n\nThe instructions require modifications in the `get_related_selections` method to handle `FilteredRelation` and ensure related objects are correctly set during nested `select_related()` processing. The relevant part starts at the beginning of the method where the `FilteredRelation` is processed and includes setting correct related object handling logic. The specific lines that should be modified include the handling of `FilteredRelation` and related object setters.",
