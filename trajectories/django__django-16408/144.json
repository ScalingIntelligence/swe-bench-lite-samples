This could be due to incorrect handling of related objects in the query construction or prefetching logic. The relevant code likely resides in the SQLCompiler class for query compilation, the ForwardManyToOneDescriptor class for related object fetching, and the Query class for adding filtered relations. Additionally, functions like get_related_selections in compiler.py and get_prefetch_queryset in related_descriptors.py are likely to be involved. The test case suggests focusing on the interaction between these components when handling multi-level relations and prefetching.",

            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it appears to be related to a problem with the 'FilteredRelation' and 'select_related' functionality in Django's ORM. The issue specifically points out that when using a multi-level 'FilteredRelation' with 'select_related()', it may set the wrong related object. This suggests that there is a bug in the logic that handles the combination of these two features. The provided search results contain relevant code spans from Django's ORM, specifically in the files 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/query.py'. These files include classes and methods that deal with SQL compilation and query construction, which are likely places where the bug might be occurring. The key methods to focus on are 'get_related_selections' in 'SQLCompiler' and 'add_filtered_relation' in 'Query', as they directly involve the construction of related selections and the handling of filtered relations, respectively. In 'get_related_selections', the method that recursively builds the selection of related fields and handles the 'select_related' logic is found. This method also deals with the depth of recursion and the setup of joins, which could be relevant to the issue at hand. In 'add_filtered_relation', the method that adds a filtered relation to the query and validates the condition of the relation is located. This method is crucial for understanding how filtered relations are integrated into the query and could be where the problem lies when combined with 'select_related'. Overall, these code spans provide a good basis to investigate the reported issue. They cover the necessary functionality related to 'select_related' and 'FilteredRelation' and should be the starting point for any debugging or further investigation into the issue.",
