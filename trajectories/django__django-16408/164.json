The provided search results include various Django files that handle SQL compilation, related field descriptors, and query processing. The key code spans identified include methods in the `SQLCompiler` class, such as `get_related_selections`, which is responsible for handling related selections in SQL queries. Additionally, the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` and `ForwardOneToOneDescriptor` classes are relevant as they manage the behavior of related objects. The `Query` class's `add_filtered_relation` method is also crucial as it deals with the addition of filtered relations to queries. These components directly relate to the logic around handling related objects and filtered relations, which are central to the reported issue. By analyzing these code spans, we can understand how Django handles related objects and filtered relations, and potentially identify the root cause of the issue where the wrong related object is set. This analysis helps in determining the code paths that may need adjustments to resolve the reported issue.",
