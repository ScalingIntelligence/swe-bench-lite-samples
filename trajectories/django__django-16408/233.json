The primary focus is on identifying the relevant code spans that handle the logic for `select_related()` and `FilteredRelation`. Upon analyzing the provided search results, several key code spans stand out as highly relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **SQLCompiler.get_related_selections**: This method is central to the `select_related()` functionality in Django, managing the selection of related fields and their retrieval. It includes detailed logic for handling related objects, including filtered relations, which directly relates to the reported issue.\n\n2. **Query.add_filtered_relation**: This method is responsible for adding a `FilteredRelation` to the query, controlling how relations are filtered. The error conditions mentioned in the method might be relevant to the issue observed, especially around the handling of relation names and lookups.\n\n3. **ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset**: This method handles prefetching related objects in a many-to-one relationship, which is a part of the broader `select_related()` mechanism and could also be involved in the faulty behavior if incorrect filtering occurs.\n\nGiven these significant connections to the issue's core elements, these code spans should be examined in detail to determine whether they contribute to the reported problem and to identify potential fixes or further relevant code sections.",

Specifically, when dealing with multi-level relations and using select_related, the related object might be set incorrectly. The problem likely lies in the `get_related_selections` method in `SQLCompiler` where the logic for handling FilteredRelation is insufficient. I propose to revise this method to ensure proper handling of FilteredRelation within select_related.",
