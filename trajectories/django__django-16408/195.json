The test case suggests that the problem might be in how Django handles related selections or prefetching in the context of FilteredRelation and select_related(). Potential areas to investigate include the SQLCompiler class, specifically the get_related_selections method, as it directly deals with related selections in SQL compilation. Additionally, focus on the ForwardManyToOneDescriptor class and its methods like get_prefetch_queryset and get_object, which are central to related descriptors. Also, examine the Query class and its add_filtered_relation method as it relates to adding filtered relations to a query. Lastly, consider the prefetch_related_objects function and RelatedPopulator class that handle related object population.",
