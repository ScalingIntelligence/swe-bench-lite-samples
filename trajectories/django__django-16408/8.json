To address this, it's necessary to look into the logic handling these features in the Django ORM, specifically in the `SQLCompiler` class and its methods related to handling relations and joins. The `get_related_selections` method in `SQLCompiler` seems particularly relevant as it deals with managing related selections, including filtered relations. Additionally, the `Query` class and its handling of filtered relations are also likely relevant, especially the `add_filtered_relation` method. The search results do not cover the actual test case or the models involved (`PoolStyle`, `Tournament`), so further search is recommended for code interacting directly with these models and the test case to ensure full context and functionality can be understood and implemented. The current focus should be on understanding and possibly modifying the internal Django ORM logic to correctly handle the filtered relations within the `select_related` context.",

It ensures that the FilteredRelation is correctly managed at any level of nested select_related queries. The previous change introduced a proper mechanism to handle FilteredRelation by correctly setting the related object, ensuring it is properly accessed and the FilteredRelation does not erroneously apply to unrelated parts of the query. Given the successful application of the changes and the corrected behavior, the issue has been adequately addressed.",
