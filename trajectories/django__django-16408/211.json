To address this, we need to investigate the methods involved in handling related selections, prefetching, and filtered relations.

These files contain classes and methods that handle SQL compilation, field relationships, and query operations, which are directly related to the reported issue. Specifically, the 'SQLCompiler' class and its 'get_related_selections' method in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' are relevant for handling related selections and potentially where the issue lies. The 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor' and 'ReverseOneToOneDescriptor' classes in 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py' also deal with related field descriptors, which are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue. Lastly, the 'Query' class and its 'add_filtered_relation' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' are relevant for handling filtered relations, which is central to the issue.
