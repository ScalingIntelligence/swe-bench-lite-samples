The test case provided suggests that the error occurs specifically when using `FilteredRelation` to traverse related objects through multiple levels. Given the nature of the problem, it's likely related to the logic in Django's ORM that handles queries involving related objects, specifically where `select_related()` and `FilteredRelation` intersect in the codebase. To narrow down the search, the focus should be on the `select_related()` functionality and its interaction with `FilteredRelation`, potentially in the `SQLCompiler` class, the `Query` class, or related descriptor classes that handle the population of related objects.",

To address this, we need to examine how Django handles these relationships, specifically focusing on the SQLCompiler class and related methods, as well as the Query class. The provided search results include several relevant code spans from these classes that are likely involved in handling select_related and FilteredRelation. These include methods such as `get_select`, `get_related_selections`, `get_select_for_update_of_arguments`, and others in the SQLCompiler class, as well as methods like `get_select_mask`, `add_filtered_relation`, and `build_filter` in the Query class. These methods deal with the construction of SQL queries and the handling of related objects, which are directly relevant to the issue at hand. By examining these code spans, we can gain a deeper understanding of how Django processes these relationships and potentially identify the root cause of the issue.",
