The test case, located in known_related_objects.tests.ExistingRelatedInstancesTests, uses PoolStyle models. The failure traceback suggests that the related object retrieval in the PoolStyle model is incorrect. From the available context, the relevant Django modules appear to be django.db.models.sql.compiler, django.db.models.fields.related_descriptors, and django.db.models.sql.query. Focusing searches on functions and classes handling related object selections and prefetching in these modules should be helpful in diagnosing the issue.",

The search results include several key files and spans related to the Django ORM\u2019s query compilation and related descriptors. Specifically, the sections in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` dealing with `get_select`, `get_extra_select`, and `get_related_selections` are likely relevant as they deal with generating SQL for select clauses and managing related selections. Additionally, `django/db/models/sql/query.py` contains spans related to `add_filter` and `add_q` which are central to building SQL WHERE clauses and handling queries, likely implicated in setting up the filtering and fetching of related objects incorrectly. The `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` and `ForwardOneToOneDescriptor` classes in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` are also relevant as they deal directly with how related objects are accessed and cached, including methods like `get_prefetch_queryset` and `get_object` which might be misbehaving. Finally, `django/db/models/query.py` outlines how `QuerySet` manages `prefetch_related` operations, likely relevant to understanding where the issue might be occurring.
