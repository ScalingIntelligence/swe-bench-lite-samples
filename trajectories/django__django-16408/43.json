This method is pivotal in determining how related selections are configured and may be contributing to the issue. Additionally, `django/db/models/query.py` contains functions like `prefetch_related_objects` and the `RelatedPopulator` class which are involved in fetching and populating related objects, which could also be a part of the problem. These sections of code need to be closely examined for their interaction with `FilteredRelation` and `select_related()`.

The `QuerySet` class in `query.py` includes methods for iterator and prefetching related objects, which might play a role in the issue.
