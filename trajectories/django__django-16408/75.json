The test case provided demonstrates that the expected Tournament object is not matched with the PoolStyle object, indicating a potential issue in how related objects are being fetched and set. The search results include several relevant files such as `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `django/db/models/query.py`, and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The most pertinent code span appears to be the `get_related_selections` method within `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. This method is responsible for managing the selection of related objects in Django's ORM, which directly aligns with the issue described. Further analysis of this method and its interactions with `select_related` and `FilteredRelation` would be essential to identify and resolve the problem. The method contains logic for handling direct and reverse related field choices, managing select_related recursion depth, and setting up joins for related models. It also includes handling for restricted access due to depth limitation. The `filtered_relation` handling in `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is also a promising place to look into since FilteredRelation is directly involved in the issue. Additionally, `prefetch_related_objects` function in `django/db/models/query.py` and related descriptors in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` could contribute to the understanding of the issue but seem less directly related than the `get_related_selections` method.",

Similarly, the `add_filtered_relation` method in the `Query` class is essential for understanding how filtered relations are added to a query. These methods might contain the logic that is causing the incorrect related object to be set, especially around the handling of joins and the selection of columns in related tables.
