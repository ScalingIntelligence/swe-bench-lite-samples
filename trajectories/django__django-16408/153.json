The search results contain several key modules that interact with related objects, including `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py`. These modules encapsulate the core logic for handling queries, relations, and prefetching in Django models. The spans identified in the search results, such as `Query.add_filtered_relation`, `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor`, and `prefetch_related_objects`, are closely related to the problem described in the reported issue as they handle filtered relations, forward descriptors, and prefetching mechanisms, respectively. By analyzing these spans, we can identify the relevant code that might need adjustments to fix the reported issue concerning the wrong related object being set in complex queries.
