The test case provided is located in a test module within Django's 'known_related_objects' tests, indicating the issue is related to the core functionality of handling relations in Django's ORM. To address this, I need to search within the Django ORM core files, focusing on classes and functions related to SQL compilation, query execution, and relation descriptor handling. The provided files and code spans suggest investigating the SQLCompiler, ForwardManyToOneDescriptor, and Query classes, as well as the get_related_populators function, which are all involved in the process of compiling and executing SQL queries and handling related objects.",

The test case provided suggests that the issue is related to how Django handles complex select_related queries combined with FilteredRelation. Upon reviewing the search results, several critical code spans are identified that are relevant to resolving this issue.\n\n1. In `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections`, the function handles the recursion and setup for related selections, which is central to how select_related and FilteredRelation interact. This section is likely to be where the issue originates, specifically where filtered relations are processed at different depths.\n\n2. The `Query.add_filtered_relation` method is directly responsible for adding filtered relations to the query. Understanding how it processes and validates the relation aliases and lookups is crucial to ensure correct behavior.\n\n3. `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset` and `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_object` are related to how related objects are fetched and cached, which could be indirectly affected by the select_related issue when combined with FilteredRelation.\n\nThese sections provide a strong foundation for investigating and potentially resolving the reported issue regarding Multi-level FilteredRelation with select_related().",
