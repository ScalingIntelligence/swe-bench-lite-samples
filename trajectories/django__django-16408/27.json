The search results provide several relevant code spans that deal with the logic behind select_related and FilteredRelation. Specifically, the 'get_related_selections' method in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' is responsible for handling the selection of related fields and setting up joins. This method is crucial for understanding how related objects are fetched and cached. Additionally, the 'add_filtered_relation' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is relevant as it deals with adding filtered relations to the query, which is a key part of the issue. The 'get_prefetch_queryset' methods in 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py' are also valuable as they handle the prefetching logic, which is closely related to select_related. These methods will help in diagnosing why the wrong related object is being set. Finally, the 'prefetch_related_objects' function in 'django/db/models/query.py' is relevant as it orchestrates the prefetching of related objects, which is the core of the issue at hand. By examining these code spans, we can pinpoint where the logic for handling multi-level relations and filtering might be going wrong.",
