The test case and traceback indicate that there is an assertion failure when attempting to compare two related objects. The error points to a mismatch in the related objects. Given the context from the provided files, it seems relevant to investigate the SQLCompiler class, particularly the 'get_related_selections' method, as it deals with selecting related objects. It would also be prudent to look into the 'add_filtered_relation' method in the Query class, as it is related to handling filtered relations. Additionally, examining the 'get_prefetch_queryset' and 'get_object' methods in the ForwardManyToOneDescriptor class might shed light on how related objects are fetched and set. Finally, understanding how prefetch_related_objects and RelatedPopulator work could provide insights into how related objects are populated and managed.",

The search results contain several relevant code spans in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files, specifically focusing on the `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` method and the `Query.add_filtered_relation` method. These methods are crucial for handling the selection of related objects, potentially including filtered relations. The `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file also includes the `Query.__init__` method where `_filtered_relations` is initialized, further emphasizing the importance of tracking filtered relations. However, the code spans provided do not include the specific implementation of `select_related` that might be causing the issue. The analysis suggests that deeper inspection of these methods, particularly around how filtered relations and select_related interact, is necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue. Additional search results or even unit tests might provide more clues.
