The provided search results from the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file contain the `get_related_selections` method, which directly handles the logic for handling related selections in a query, including descending into related fields and applying filters. This method appears to be highly relevant as it deals with how Django processes and joins related models in a query, which could be directly related to the issue at hand. Additionally, the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file contains the `add_filtered_relation` method that specifically handles the addition of filtered relations to a query, which is another crucial part of the functionality mentioned in the issue. These two methods, `get_related_selections` and `add_filtered_relation`, are likely the key areas in the codebase that would need to be examined and potentially adjusted to address the reported issue.",
