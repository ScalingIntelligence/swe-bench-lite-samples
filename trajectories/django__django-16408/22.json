The key elements to look for in the search results are how select_related and FilteredRelation are handled in the codebase. \n\nIn django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, the method `get_related_selections` deals with handling related selections for select_related. This method is responsible for recursively determining which related fields to include in the query. It also handles the logic for setting cached values for related fields, which could be relevant to the issue of setting the wrong related object. \n\nIn django/db/models/query.py, the `prefetch_related_objects` function handles prefetching related objects. Although related, the issue does not seem to be directly about prefetching but rather about the correct setting of related objects during the initial query. Therefore, while relevant in understanding related logic, it is not the primary focus for addressing the issue.\n\nIn django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py, the methods `get_prefetch_queryset` and `get_object` in the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` and `ReverseOneToOneDescriptor` classes handle how related objects are fetched and set. These methods manage the querysets and instances dictionary, which could be relevant to ensuring the correct related object is set.\n\nFinally, in django/db/models/sql/query.py, the method `add_filtered_relation` is responsible for adding a filtered relation to the query. This method determines how the FilteredRelation conditions are added to the query and checked for consistency, which is critical for ensuring the FilteredRelation doesn't lead to incorrect related objects.\n\nOverall, the identified sections of the code provide a strong foundation for investigating and addressing the reported issue. The focus should be on the logic within `get_related_selections` in the SQLCompiler class, particularly how cached values for related fields are set and managed, and on the `add_filtered_relation` method in the Query class to ensure FilteredRelation conditions are correctly applied.",
