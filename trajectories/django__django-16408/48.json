This involves complex queries and annotations that interact with the database. The search results provide several key functions and classes that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **SQLCompiler.get_related_selections**: This function is central to how Django handles select_related. It sets up the selections and joins necessary to fetch related objects in a single query. This function processes direct and reverse relations, as well as filtered relations, making it a prime candidate for addressing the incorrect related object setting.\n\n2. **Query.add_filtered_relation**: This function is responsible for adding a filtered relation to a query. It ensures that the relation is correctly applied to the query conditions, which is crucial for ensuring the correct objects are retrieved when using filtered relations.\n\n3. **ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset**: This function handles the prefetching of related objects in a many-to-one relationship, which is relevant when dealing with nested select_related queries.\n\nFrom a preliminary analysis, it seems that the logic in SQLCompiler.get_related_selections might be a key component in understanding and potentially fixing the issue with Multi-level FilteredRelation not setting the correct related object.",
