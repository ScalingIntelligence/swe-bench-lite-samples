To address this, it's crucial to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the management and handling of related objects, particularly with FilteredRelation and select_related. In the provided search results, there are several key areas that appear relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **SQLCompiler.get_related_selections**: This method is responsible for managing related selections in SQL compilation. It involves setting up joins, managing related fields, and handling related selections.\n\n2. **Query.add_filtered_relation**: This method is specifically about adding a FilteredRelation to the query, which is directly related to the issue reported. It deals with the parsing and validation of FilteredRelation conditions.\n\n3. **prefetch_related_objects**: Even though not directly mentioned in the issue, this function is relevant as it handles the prefetching of related objects, which could interact with select_related behavior and potentially impact the issue.\n\n4. **ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset and ReverseOneToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset**: These methods handle the prefetching of querysets for related objects, which, while not directly related to the error, could provide insights into how related objects are fetched and cached, which might be contributing to the issue.\n\nGiven these findings, I will identify the specific spans of code from the search results that most directly address the reported issue.",
