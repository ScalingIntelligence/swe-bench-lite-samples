The issue indicates a problem where the related object is being set incorrectly, leading to a failed assertion in the test case. The search results provide several relevant spans of code across different files that handle the logic for select_related, FilteredRelation, and related fields. These spans include the SQLCompiler and Query classes responsible for SQL compilation and query construction, as well as the ForwardManyToOneDescriptor and RelatedField classes that manage related descriptors and fields. The identified code spans are: \n1. SQLCompiler.get_related_selections: Handles the selection of related fields during query compilation.\n2. Query._get_only_select_mask: Manages the selection mask for fields in the query.\n3. Query.build_filtered_relation_q: Constructs the Q object for FilteredRelation conditions.\n4. Query.add_filtered_relation: Adds a FilteredRelation to the query.\n5. ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset: Handles prefetching related querysets.\n6. RelatedField.get_forward_related_filter: Gets the filter for forward related fields.\nThese spans are critical for understanding and potentially fixing the issue with the incorrect related object being set when using select_related() with FilteredRelation.",

The modification should ensure that FilteredRelation objects are included in the related_klass_infos and the selection logic is adjusted to handle these relations properly.",
