This issue is complex and requires understanding how Django handles related objects and filtered relations. The relevant code spans identified in the search results focus on the functions and classes that manage these relationships, specifically those related to `FilteredRelation`, `select_related`, and the query compilation process.\n\n1. The `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` contains methods critical for managing related selections (`get_related_selections`). This method ensures proper handling of relations when using `select_related` and `FilteredRelation`, which is directly relevant to the issue.\n\n2. The `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` includes methods for adding filtered relations (`add_filtered_relation`), which is crucial for understanding how Django integrates `FilteredRelation` into queries. This method ensures that `FilteredRelation` conditions are correctly applied within the context of the related fields, which is essential for resolving the reported issue.\n\n3. The `prefetch_related_objects` function in `django/db/models/query.py` and the `RelatedPopulator` class are also important as they handle the population of related objects, contributing to the overall query execution and result handling. These areas can help in understanding how data binding occurs with related objects, particularly in the context of filtered relations.\n\nThese code spans provide a comprehensive view of Django's underlying mechanisms for handling related object queries, which is crucial for diagnosing and resolving the reported issue.",
