The relevant code spans identified are primarily in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files. The `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` method and the `Query.add_filtered_relation` method are particularly relevant as they deal with the handling of related selections and the addition of filtered relations respectively. These methods involve logic for managing and querying related objects, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Additionally, examining the rest of the code within these spans would likely uncover additional context around how these features interact, potentially leading to the issue described. Furthermore, the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset` and `ForwardOneToOneDescriptor.get_object` methods in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` are also relevant as they deal with prefetching querysets and obtaining related objects, which could be tied to the issue observed in the test case.",
