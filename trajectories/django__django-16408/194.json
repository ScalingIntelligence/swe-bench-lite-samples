The test case provided demonstrates an assertion failure where the tournament and tournament_pool objects do not match after being fetched with select_related(). This suggests an issue with how related objects are being fetched and possibly cached. From the provided search results, several code spans are relevant. In 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'get_related_selections' method is crucial as it deals with fetching related objects and could be where the issue lies, especially with the handling of 'select_related' and 'FilteredRelation'. In 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py', the 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor' and 'ForwardOneToOneDescriptor' classes are relevant, particularly the 'get_prefetch_queryset' and 'get_object' methods, as they manage how related objects are fetched and prefetched. Also, the 'Query' class in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is relevant, specifically the 'add_filtered_relation' method, as it deals with how filtered relations are added to the query, which could affect the correctness of the related objects fetched. Lastly, the 'prefetch_related_objects' function in 'django/db/models/query.py' is also considered relevant as it handles prefetching operations, which could tie into the issue if the prefetched data is not correctly aligned with the main query results. These selections are made to ensure that all aspects of related object handling in Django, particularly in relation to 'select_related' and 'FilteredRelation' are covered, aligning with the reported issue.",
