The issue is that the related object obtained via `select_related` is incorrect when using `FilteredRelation`. The search results include relevant code spans from Django's source code, such as SQLCompiler's `get_related_selections` method, which handles the selection of related fields. Additionally, the `Query` class's `add_filtered_relation` method is relevant as it deals with the addition of filtered relations to a query. Lastly, the `RelatedPopulator` class and its methods are crucial for understanding how related objects are populated in the ORM. These code spans should provide sufficient context to diagnose and potentially fix the issue with `select_related()` and `FilteredRelation`.",
