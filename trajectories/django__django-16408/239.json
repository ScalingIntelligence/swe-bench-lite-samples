The test case provided checks a scenario where the tournament_pool relation is incorrectly set to a PoolStyle object instead of a Tournament object. The search results provided include classes and methods from Django's ORM, specifically SQLCompiler and Query classes. The SQLCompiler class has methods for handling related selections, which could be related to the issue (get_related_selections). The Query class is responsible for managing the SQL query construction, including methods for adding filtered relations (add_filtered_relation). The ForwardManyToOneDescriptor class, responsible for one-to-many relations, could also be relevant. These classes and methods are significant because they deal directly with how related objects are selected and managed in Django's ORM, which is central to the reported issue.
