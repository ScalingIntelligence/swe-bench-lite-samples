The test case provided explicitly mentions a specific scenario where PoolStyle.objects.annotate(...).select_related('tournament_pool') results in an AssertionError due to mismatch between expected and actual related objects. The search results include several relevant files and spans of code that deal with SQL compilation, query processing, and the handling of related objects through 'select related'. Specifically, spans dealing with get_related_selections, add_filtered_relation, and query processing in QuerySet and Query classes are the most relevant as they directly affect how related objects are fetched and processed in Django's ORM. These spans provide the underlying logic for how Django constructs SQL queries for related objects and how it caches and retrieves these objects, which is directly pertinent to the reported issue of wrong related object assignment. This comprehensive analysis of the code spans ensures a detailed understanding of how related data is handled, providing strong evidence that the identified code spans are indeed relevant to the issue at hand. Further, the presence of methods like get_prefetch_queryset and _prefetch_related_objects in the QuerySet class shows how Django prefetches and caches related objects, which is crucial in understanding and resolving the issue of incorrect related object assignment in multi-level filtered relations combined with select_related(). Considering the detailed alignment of the functions and methods in the code spans with the reported issue, these spans must be further analyzed and possibly adjusted to ensure the correct behavior of related object assignment.",
