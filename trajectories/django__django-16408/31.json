First, in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'get_related_selections' method deals with how related fields are processed and selected during query compilation. This could be directly related to the issue of selecting the wrong related object. Secondly, 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py' contains descriptors for related fields such as 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor' and 'ReverseOneToOneDescriptor', which manage how related objects are accessed and prefetched. These could also be contributing to the issue if there's a problem with how the related objects are being managed or cached. Finally, 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' includes the 'Query.add_filtered_relation' method, which handles the addition of filtered relations to a query. This is directly related to the issue given that the problem occurs with a 'FilteredRelation'. These sections of code are likely where the root cause of the issue can be found.",
