            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a Multi-level FilteredRelation with select_related() potentially setting the wrong related object. This issue is complex and involves accurately handling nested relationships across multiple models. The key elements from the reported issue include: 1. The `PoolStyle` model. 2. The `FilteredRelation` on a nested relationship (`'pool__tournament__pool'`). 3. The use of `select_related('tournament_pool')`. 4. A test case that fails due to an assertion error, indicating the nested tournament object is incorrect. To address this issue, we need to examine the code that deals with handling these nested relationships and filtered relations. The search results show several relevant code spans, particularly in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files. These files contain methods responsible for managing SQL compilation and query construction, crucial for correctly interpreting and executing the nested `select_related` and `FilteredRelation` features. \n\nSpecifically, the method `get_related_selections` in `SQLCompiler` demonstrates how Django handles nested related selections during query compilation. This method is critical for our issue as it navigates through multiple levels of relationships, decides which fields to include in the query, and how to set the related objects correctly. This process directly impacts how the `select_related` function operates with nested `FilteredRelation` fields. Additionally, the `Query` class's `add_filtered_relation` method in `query.py` is relevant for understanding how Django integrates `FilteredRelation` into queries, including error handling for unsupported nested relations. This method adds a filtered relation to the query, ensuring that the conditions applied to the relation are appropriately supported and integrated into the query logic. \n\nThe combination of these methods, particularly focusing on where and how nested relationships are handled in `get_related_selections` and how relations are added and validated in `add_filtered_relation`, is fundamental to addressing the issue. By ensuring that the nested relationships are correctly interpreted and correctly set within the query structure, we can potentially resolve the issue with the `select_related` function setting the wrong related object.",
