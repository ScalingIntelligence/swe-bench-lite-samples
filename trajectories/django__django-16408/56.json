The test case compares the tournament objects from two different paths, and they should be equal but are not. This suggests an issue with how relationships are being handled or joined in the SQL query generation or execution. The relevant files and classes to look into are those dealing with SQL compilation, relationship handling, and query construction in Django's ORM, specifically SQLCompiler, related_descriptors, and Query classes. These are crucial for understanding and fixing the problem. The method get_related_selections in SQLCompiler and the methods in related_descriptors related to prefetching and getting objects are primary areas to investigate.",
