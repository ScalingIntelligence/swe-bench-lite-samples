The test case provided specifically points at the `PoolStyle` model and its related `tournament_pool` field.

The relevant files identified from the context include `compiler.py`, `related_descriptors.py`, `query.py`, and `query.py`. We should perform searches within these files or scripts that interact closely with them, targeting functions like `get_related_selections`, `get_prefetch_queryset`, `get_object`, `add_filtered_relation`, and `prefetch_related_objects`, among others.",

These sections include the `get_related_selections` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which manages the selection of related fields and handles the recursive depth of related selections. Additionally, the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` and `ReverseOneToOneDescriptor` classes in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` handle the descriptors for related objects, which might be involved in how related objects are cached or retrieved. Finally, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` includes the `add_filtered_relation` method, which is explicitly related to handling FilteredRelation.
