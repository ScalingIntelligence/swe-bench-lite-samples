This issue is related to database query optimization and the handling of related objects in Django's ORM. The search results provided contain several key components that could be related to the resolution of this issue. Specifically, the 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' file includes the SQLCompiler class, which is responsible for compiling SQL queries. Within this file, the 'get_related_selections' method is particularly relevant as it deals with the selection of related fields in a query and could be where the incorrect selection is occurring. Additionally, the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file contains the 'add_filtered_relation' method, which is used to add filtered relations to a query. This method could also be involved in the incorrect handling of related objects due to the filtering process. Lastly, the 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py' file includes the 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor' class and its 'get_prefetch_queryset' method, which is responsible for prefetching related objects. This method could also be a part of the problem if the prefetching process is not correctly handling filtered relations. Overall, these components are highly relevant to the reported issue and should be thoroughly investigated to determine the root cause and potential solution.",

The change should ensure that the related object is correctly set in the query results when nested relations and filtered relations are both present.\n\nTo handle multi-level `FilteredRelation` with `select_related()`, modifications are needed in the `get_related_selections` method. Specifically, changes are required around the handling of `filtered_relations` to ensure that they are processed appropriately when nested relations and filtered relations coexist.",
