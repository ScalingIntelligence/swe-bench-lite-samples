The test case provided in the issue attempts to annotate a query with a filtered relation and then use select_related to fetch related objects. However, the assertion fails because the related object fetched does not match the expected tournament. The search results include multiple files from Django's ORM, specifically focusing on the SQL compiler, query handling, and related object population. From the given search results, it appears that the relevant code spans that could be related to the issue might include handling of select_related, filtered relations, and the actual SQL compilation and execution. These spans include methods such as `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections`, `SQLCompiler.get_select`, `RelatedPopulator.populate`, and `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset`. These methods deal with how Django constructs SQL queries for related objects and how it populates the related objects after fetching them from the database. Therefore, these code spans are likely relevant to investigating and potentially fixing the issue reported.",
