To find the root cause, focus on Django's ORM and SQL compilation code where these operations (filtered relations and select related) are handled. Look for specific functions and classes responsible for these operations to identify where the mismatch occurs.",

The key elements to focus on are the management and resolution of related selections and joins within `SQLCompiler` and its interactions with `Query` methods such as `add_filtered_relation`. Additionally, understanding how the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` handles prefetching and related queries is crucial due to its role in managing related object access and caching.\n\nIn the provided search results, the `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` method is particularly relevant as it recursively retrieves and sets up related objects, which could be where the erroneous assignment occurs. Furthermore, `Query.add_filtered_relation` manages the addition of filtered relations to the query, which is directly related to the reported issue. The `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor.get_prefetch_queryset` method is also relevant for understanding how related objects are prefetched and cached, aligning with the issue's focus on related data handling.\n\nThus, these code spans within `SQLCompiler`, `Query`, and `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` are directly aligned with the problem described in the reported issue and should therefore be identified as relevant.",
