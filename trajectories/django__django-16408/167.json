This suggests a problem with how related objects are being fetched and set in the Django ORM. The provided search results contain the `RelatedPopulator` class, which is responsible for populating related objects. The methods `__init__` and `populate` in `RelatedPopulator` are crucial for understanding how related objects are initialized and set. These methods handle the fetching and setting of related objects based on the query results. Given the context of the issue and the code provided, it is likely that the bug or issue arises from the logic within these methods that handle the population of related objects. The `select_related()` functionality and how it interacts with `FilteredRelation` during the population process seem particularly relevant to the reported issue.
