The relevant files provided hint at Django's ORM internals, particularly where related objects are managed and queried. The core logic for managing related objects, including prefetching and filtering, is likely spread across these files. To address the problem accurately, a targeted search within these files for specific methods and functionalities such as `get_related_selections`, `get_prefetch_queryset`, `add_filtered_relation`, and `prefetch_related_objects` is necessary. Additionally, focusing on the unit test file where the issue manifests can provide insights into how the ORM's behavior diverges from expected results.",
