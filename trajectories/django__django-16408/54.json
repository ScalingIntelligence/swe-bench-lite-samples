The test case provided indicates that the problem arises when using FilteredRelation and select_related together, resulting in an assertion failure where the wrong object is retrieved. To address this, we need to focus on code spans that deal with FilteredRelation, select_related, and related object retrieval mechanisms. The search results include several key sections in the Django ORM codebase that are likely relevant. These include the SQLCompiler class in 'compiler.py', which handles the preparation of SQL queries, and specifically the 'get_related_selections' method where the logic for handling select_related might need adjustment. Additionally, the 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor' and 'ForwardOneToOneDescriptor' classes in 'related_descriptors.py', which manage the retrieval of related objects, are relevant, particularly the 'get_prefetch_queryset' and 'get_object' methods. These methods are crucial for the correct handling of related objects during prefetching and retrieval. Further, the 'Query' class in 'query.py', specifically the 'add_filtered_relation' method, is relevant as it deals with the addition of filtered relations to queries, which is central to the issue at hand. Lastly, the 'prefetch_related_objects' function in 'query.py' is worth examining as it deals with prefetching related objects, a process that may be misbehaving due to the filtered relation handling. Overall, these sections of code are pertinent to the issue and should be inspected and potentially modified to ensure correct functionality of select_related with FilteredRelation.",
