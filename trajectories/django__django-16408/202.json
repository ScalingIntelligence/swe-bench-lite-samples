The relevant code spans within these files include methods related to SQL compilation and handling related objects.\n\n1. In 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'SQLCompiler.get_related_selections' method is responsible for setting up related selections and handling the logic for descending into related fields, which is critical for the functionality at hand. This method defines the behavior for selecting related fields and setting cached values, which could be where the incorrect object assignment occurs.\n\n2. In 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py', the 'ForwardManyToOneDescriptor' class and its methods like 'get_prefetch_queryset' and 'get_object' are potentially involved in the process of retrieving and setting related objects.
