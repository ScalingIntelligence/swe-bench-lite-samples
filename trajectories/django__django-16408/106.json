Specifically, the test case demonstrates that the `select_related()` call sets the wrong related object, leading to an `AssertionError`. To address this, we need to inspect the relevant parts of the Django ORM codebase that handle `select_related()` and `FilteredRelation`. The provided search results include several key files and spans of code that are likely relevant to the issue: The `SQLCompiler` class in `compiler.py`, particularly where `select_related` functionality might be handled. The `Query` class in `query.py`, which could be where the issue arises with the combination of `select_related` and `FilteredRelation`. The `QuerySet` class in `query.py` and its `_iterator` method, which is central to executing queries and handling related objects. These sections of code are critical for understanding how the ORM constructs SQL queries and how related objects are fetched and set. By thoroughly examining these code spans, we can identify where the logic might be going wrong when these features are combined.",
