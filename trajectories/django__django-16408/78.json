To debug this, it is crucial to investigate the methods and logic associated with SQL compilation, related field handling, and SQL query construction. Specifically, focus on methods dealing with related selections in SQL compilation (`get_related_selections`), prefetching related objects (`prefetch_related_objects`), and handling filtered relations (`add_filtered_relation`).",

Notably, `django/db/models/sql/query.py` includes `Query` and methods related to adding annotations (`add_annotation`) and building filters (`build_filter`), which could be involved in the issue. Additionally, `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` includes `SQLCompiler` and subclasses like `SQLUpdateCompiler`, which deal with SQL compilation for different operations, potentially relevant to how annotations and related objects are handled in SQL generation.
