The test case provided in the issue attempts to assert that the `tournament` associated with a `pool` matches the `tournament_pool` when using `select_related()`. The failure indicates a mismatch, suggesting that the related object is not being set correctly. Searching through the provided codebase, several key sections related to this functionality were identified. The `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` is responsible for handling related selections and could potentially be involved in the issue due to its handling of `select_related_descend` and related model setup. Additionally, the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` and `ReverseOneToOneDescriptor` classes in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` manage the related descriptors and their prefetching, which could also contribute to the issue if the prefetching logic is incorrect. Lastly, the `Query.add_filtered_relation` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is used to add filtered relations to the query and could be part of the problem if the relation filtering logic is faulty. These sections of code are likely relevant to identifying the root cause of the reported issue.",
