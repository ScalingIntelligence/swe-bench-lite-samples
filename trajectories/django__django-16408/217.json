This could be due to how Django handles related selections or prefetch for annotations. The error occurs specifically in the PoolStyle model's handling of tournament_pool FilteredRelation. To debug this, it's crucial to look into the relevant Django ORM handling files, methods like get_related_selections, get_prefetch_queryset, and add_filtered_relation as these are directly related to how Django handles relations during query compilation and execution.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a multi-level FilteredRelation with select_related() setting the wrong related object. This suggests that there is a problem with how Django is handling the SQL query generation and the subsequent data binding when using these features. The search results include several key sections of Django's ORM code that are directly related to query compilation, specifically the SQLCompiler class and its methods. Here's a breakdown of why each section is relevant:\n\n1. **SQLCompiler.get_related_selections**: This method is crucial for determining which related fields should be included in the SQL query when using select_related(). Given the issue involves incorrect related objects, this method could potentially be the source of the error.\n\n2. **SQLCompiler.setup_query**: This method prepares the SQL query, including setting up the select clause, which is directly related to the fields that will be fetched from the database. Any misconfiguration here could lead to incorrect related objects being bound to the model instances.\n\n3. **SQLCompiler.__init__**: The initialization method is relevant because it sets up the compiler, which could potentially impact how subsequent methods process the query data.\n\n4. **Query.add_filtered_relation**: This method is central to handling FilteredRelation instances in the query. Since the issue is specifically about a multi-level FilteredRelation, examining how this method integrates the filtered relation into the query is essential.\n\n5. **Query.setup_joins**: This method sets up the joins in the query, which are critical for fetching related data. Improper handling of joins could result in the wrong related objects being selected.\n\n6. **RelatedPopulator.populate**: This method is responsible for populating related objects into the model instances. If there's a mismatch between the data fetched by the SQL query and how it's bound to the models, this method would be the likely location for the error.\n\nGiven the centrality of the SQLCompiler and Query classes to Django's ORM query processing, and the direct relevance of the methods highlighted above to handling FilteredRelation and select_related(), all these sections are highly relevant to diagnosing and fixing the reported issue.",
