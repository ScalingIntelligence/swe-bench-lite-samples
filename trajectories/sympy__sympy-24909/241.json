To address this, we need to focus on the code logic related to prefixes and unit multiplications in the `Prefix` class and potentially in the `Quantity` class or any involved in unit handling. Specifically, we should look at the `__mul__` methods in these classes and any utility functions related to prefix and unit operations.",

Specifically, when the milli prefix is multiplied by a unit like watts, it should evaluate to a quantity in milli watts. However, in the provided example, milli times watts evaluates to the number 1 instead of milli watts. The current file context includes the definition of the Prefix class and its __mul__ method, which handles multiplication. In the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the prefixes.py, quantities.py, and dimensions.py files. The __mul__ method in the Prefix class is particularly relevant as it is where the multiplication behavior is defined. The issue seems to be in the condition `if fact == 1: return 1` which incorrectly returns 1 when multiplying milli by watts. By identifying these code spans, it will help to understand and address the bug.",
