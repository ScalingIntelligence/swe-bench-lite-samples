The expected behavior is to get milli watts or milli volts when multiplying milli by a unit. However, the observed behavior is different: 'milli*W' evaluates to the number 1, and 'W*milli' results in 'watt*Prefix(milli, m, -3, 10)'. To address this issue, we should identify the implementation of the 'Prefix' class responsible for handling the 'milli' and other prefixes, focusing on the '__mul__' method that handles multiplication operations. We should also look into the 'prefix_unit' function which bundles the units with the prefix. Additionally, inspecting the 'Quantity' class and its methods (__mul__, __rmul__) might reveal how units and prefixes are combined or mishandled in the current implementation.",

The specific problem is that `milli * W` evaluates to `1`, whereas the expected result is `milli watts` or `mW`. This suggests an issue with how the multiplication of a prefix with a unit is handled in the code.\n\nThe search results include several relevant code spans:\n1. The `Prefix` class definition, which is likely the class representing the `milli` prefix in the code.\n2. The `Prefix.__mul__` method, which defines the behavior when a `Prefix` instance is multiplied with another object. This is the method directly responsible for handling the multiplication of `milli` with a unit.\n3. The `prefix_unit` function, which seems to be involved in creating prefixed units. This could be related to how units like `W` are instantiated with prefixes.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we need to focus on the `Prefix.__mul__` method, where the multiplication logic is implemented. The problem seems to arise from the condition `if fact == 1: return 1`, which incorrectly returns `1` when the scale factors multiplied result in `1`. Additionally, understanding how the `prefix_unit` function works might provide more context on how prefixed units are created and processed in the system.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue are the `Prefix.__mul__` method and potentially the `prefix_unit` function.",

If the product of their 'ScaleFactors' equals 1, it returns 1, which seems to be the root cause of the issue where 'milli*W' evaluates to 1 instead of the expected 'milli watts' or 'mW'. This inconsistency arises because the method has a mechanism to return 1 when scale factors multiply to 1, which is not the desired behavior in this context. The 'prefix_unit' function demonstrates how prefixes and units are combined during initialization by creating a new 'Quantity' with a name and abbreviation that reflect the combination of the prefix and the base unit. However, it does not affect the runtime behavior of how prefixes and units interact during multiplications.

I have tried this with Watts and Volts, I'm not sure what other cases this happens. I'm using sympy version 1.11.1-1 on Arch Linux with Python 3.10.9. If you cannot reproduce I would be happy to be of any assitance.\n"
