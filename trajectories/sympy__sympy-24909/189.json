Specifically, the issue is that milli*W is evaluating to 1, rather than milli watts (mW). This suggests a problem with the `__mul__` method in the Prefix class within the sympy.physics.units.prefixes module. By examining the code span for the `Prefix.__mul__` method, it becomes clear that the method has a condition where if the product of the scale factors equals 1, it returns 1. This is likely the source of the bug, as it incorrectly handles the multiplication of a prefix with a unit. Therefore, I have identified the `Prefix.__mul__` span as relevant to the reported issue.",
