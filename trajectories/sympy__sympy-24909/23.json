Specifically, the product of 'milli' and 'W' should result in milli watts (mW) but instead evaluates to the number 1. This discrepancy is due to the way the '__mul__' method in the Prefix class handles the multiplication, particularly the lines where it checks if the combined scale factor of the prefix and the quantity is 1 and returns 1 if so. The search results include the Quantity class from sympy/physics/units/quantities.py, which is relevant because it is the type of object instances of the 'W' unit are likely to be. This class and its methods involve the management and properties of quantities, such as setting their global dimension, scale factors, and other attributes. Given the nature of the bug, focusing on the '__mul__' method in the Prefix class and the interaction of Prefix instances with Quantity instances is crucial. Additionally, understanding how Quantity instances handle prefixes and scale factors globally is key to resolving the bug. Thus, the identified code spans include both the '__mul__' method in the Prefix class and sections of the Quantity class that deal with scale factors and prefixes.",

I have tried this with Watts and Volts, I'm not sure what other cases this happens. I'm using sympy version 1.11.1-1 on Arch Linux with Python 3.10.9. If you cannot reproduce I would be happy to be of any assitance.\n"
