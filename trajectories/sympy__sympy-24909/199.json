The provided search results include a snippet from 'sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py' which defines the 'Prefix' class and its '__mul__' method. This method is responsible for handling multiplication operations involving prefixes and quantities. The method checks if the multiplication results in a scale factor of 1, and if so, it returns 1, which aligns with the observed behavior in the user's issue. This indicates that the method might be the cause of the unexpected behavior.
