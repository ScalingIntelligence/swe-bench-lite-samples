Specifically, the issue is that 'milli * W' evaluates to the number 1 instead of the expected 'milli watts' or 'mW'. Given the context, the most relevant part of the code seems to be the 'Prefix' class and its '__mul__' method in the 'sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py' file. This method is responsible for handling multiplication between a prefix and another object, and it includes the logic for scaling factors. It is crucial to examine this code span to understand how the multiplication operation is being handled and why it might be resulting in 1 in certain cases, as the user reported. Therefore, this span is directly related to the reported issue and should be considered relevant for further debugging or modifications to address the bug.",
