Specifically, the user observed that 'milli*W' evaluates to 1 instead of milli watts. This suggests a problem in the handling of prefix multiplication within the 'Prefix' class or its related methods. The provided search results include the 'Prefix' class definition and its '__mul__' method. The '__mul__' method is key in understanding how prefix multiplication is handled. It checks the type of 'other' and performs multiplication based on that. The condition `if fact == 1: return 1` might be causing the issue reported, as it prematurely returns 1 when the multiplication result of the scale factors equals 1. This could be why 'milli*W' evaluates to 1 instead of milli watts (mW). Thus, the 'Prefix' class and its '__mul__' method are directly relevant to fixing the reported bug.",
