The expected behavior is for `milli*W` to evaluate to milli watts (mW), but instead, it evaluates to the number 1 or an expression containing the prefix and the unit separately. This suggests that there might be an issue in how the multiplication operation is handled for prefixes and units.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, we can see that the `Prefix` class has a `__mul__` method that deals with the multiplication of prefixes with other quantities or prefixes. The method checks if the result of multiplying the scale factors equals 1, and if so, it returns 1. This is likely where the erroneous result of 1 for `milli*W` is coming from. Additionally, the method does not handle the case where a prefix is multiplied by a unit in a way that maintains the unit's integrity and expresses the result as a prefixed unit.\n\nConsidering the current file context is empty, the identified issue is likely to be addressed in the `Prefix.__mul__` method in the `sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py` file. This method needs to be adjusted to handle the multiplication of a prefix with a unit correctly, ensuring that the result is expressed as a prefixed unit rather than a numerical value or a separate expression involving the prefix and unit.",

The unexpected behavior is that 'milli*W' evaluates to 1 instead of milli watts. This issue is likely related to how the 'Prefix' class and its '__mul__' method handle multiplication with 'Quantity' objects. The current file context shows the 'Prefix' class and its '__mul__' method, which includes a condition that returns 1 if the multiplication result is 1. This could be the root cause of the issue. The new search results provide the 'Quantity' class, which is likely involved in the multiplication operation. Since the issue concerns the interaction between 'Prefix' and 'Quantity', both classes are relevant. The identified spans should include the '__mul__' method in 'Prefix' and relevant parts of the 'Quantity' class.",
