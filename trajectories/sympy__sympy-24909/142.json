This suggests a problem in the handling of prefixes and units multiplication within the sympy.physics.units module. The search results provide a relevant code span in 'sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py'. Specifically, the '__mul__' method of the 'Prefix' class appears to be the critical area where the multiplication logic of prefixes with units is implemented. This method has conditional checks for the types of objects being multiplied (specifically checking if 'other' is an instance of 'Quantity' or 'Prefix') and returns 1 if the 'scale_factor' multiplication results in 1, which seems to be the direct cause of the bug. This identified code span directly relates to the functionality under scrutiny in the issue provided and should be reviewed and possibly modified to solve the bug.",

In the search results, the `Prefix.__mul__` method is present, showing the current behavior of the multiplication operation involving prefixes and units.
