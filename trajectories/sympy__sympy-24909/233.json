The expected result is to obtain milli watts (mW) but instead, the result is either the number 1 or an expression combining the unit with the 'milli' prefix. This discrepancy could be rooted in the Prefix class's __mul__ method, which is responsible for handling multiplication involving prefixes. The code provided in the search results includes the __mul__ method of the Prefix class. This method checks the type of the operand and computes the product of scale factors, returning 1 if the product is equal to 1. This behavior matches the observed issue where milli*W evaluates to 1. Therefore, the relevant code span is the __mul__ method in the Prefix class. This method is likely where the fix needs to be applied to ensure that multiplying a unit by a prefix like 'milli' correctly produces an expression in milli units rather than the number 1.",

The expected behavior is that 'milli * W' should evaluate to milli watts (mW) instead of the number 1. The current file context provides the definition of the Prefix class and its __mul__ method. The __mul__ method is responsible for handling the multiplication of prefixes with quantities or other prefixes. The specific problematic line in the __mul__ method is the one that returns 1 when the product of scale factors equals 1. This seems to be the cause of the unexpected behavior, as multiplying 'milli' with 'W' results in a scale factor of 1, leading to the return of 1 instead of the expected Quantity. The search results exactly match the relevant code span in the __mul__ method, confirming that the identified code is indeed related to the issue.
