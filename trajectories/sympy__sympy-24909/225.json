Specifically, 'milli*W' should evaluate to milli watts (mW) but instead evaluates to 1. This suggests a problem with how the multiplication of Prefix instances with Quantity instances is handled. The relevant code spans to investigate are those defining the Prefix class and its multiplication method (__mul__). From the search results, the relevant spans to focus on are those where the Prefix class and its methods are defined. These include 'Prefix.__mul__', which is responsible for handling the multiplication of prefixes with other entities, and possibly 'Prefix.scale_factor', which might play a role in the multiplication logic. Additionally, since 'watts' and other units are defined in 'sympy/physics/units/definitions/__init__.py' and 'sympy/physics/units/definitions/unit_definitions.py', it's important to ensure that units are correctly defined and that any interactions with prefixes are properly implemented. Thus, these files should also be reviewed for relevant spans, especially where 'watt' and other units are defined and potentially related to how scaling and multiplication are handled.",
