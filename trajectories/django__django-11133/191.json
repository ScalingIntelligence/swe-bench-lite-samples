Additionally, the BinaryField's to_python method converts strings to memoryview objects, which might not be properly handled when passed to HttpResponse. These are likely places to focus on for a fix or improvement.

However, there's no mention of special handling for memoryview in the HttpResponse class, suggesting this might be where the issue lies.
