The main focus should be on the 'content' setter method of the HttpResponse class, where the type of the input value is checked and processed accordingly. The issue arises because the current implementation doesn't explicitly handle memoryview objects, leading to unexpected output as seen in the reported issue. The relevant code spans to consider are the '__init__' method of HttpResponse that initializes the content, and the 'content' setter method where the transformation of different input types to bytes occurs. These are critical for understanding and implementing a solution to properly handle memoryview objects within the HttpResponse. Additionally, the 'make_bytes' method in HttpResponseBase, which is used by the 'content' setter, is part of the overall byte-handling process and should also be considered.",

This adjustment will ensure that BinaryField data from databases like Postgresql, which returns as memoryview objects, can be correctly processed and served in HTTP responses.

The key function to investigate is `make_bytes`, which is responsible for converting various types of content into bytes that can be used in the HTTP response. Examining the `HttpResponse` class and its related methods, particularly the `content` setter that processes the incoming content, reveals the workflow of content processing. It's also important to consider the handling of iterable objects to ensure that `memoryview` objects are treated the same way as other byte-like objects once they are converted. Given the structure of the `HttpResponse` class and its methods, the relevant code spans to address the issue would be those related to content processing, including the `make_bytes` method for type conversion and the `content` setter for managing the content encapsulation.",
