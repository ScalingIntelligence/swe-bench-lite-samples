In the `HttpResponse` class, the `content` property and `write` method do not handle `memoryview` objects specifically, which is a known issue. The `BinaryField` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` includes a `to_python` method that converts string values into `memoryview` objects, suggesting this is where handling of `memoryview` objects should be addressed. Based on the provided context, it appears that the relevant code for examining and potentially modifying to handle `memoryview` objects is included.
