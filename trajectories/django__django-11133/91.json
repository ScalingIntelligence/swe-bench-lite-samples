This issue surfaces when attempting to write a BinaryField retrieved from the database into a HttpResponse. The PostgreSQL database returns contents of the field as memoryview objects, which Django's current implementation does not handle correctly. The provided search results include two key files: 'django/http/response.py' and 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py'. In 'django/http/response.py', the `HttpResponse` class and its `__init__`, `content`, and `write` methods are relevant. These methods are responsible for initializing the HttpResponse with content and writing new content to it. The issue suggests that handling memoryview objects directly in these methods might resolve the problem. In 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', the `BinaryField` class and its methods, such as `__init__`, `check`, `get_db_prep_value`, and `to_python`, are relevant. These methods are involved in converting and preparing the field value for database operations, which can be related to the conversion issues encountered with memoryview objects. The classes and methods identified in both files are likely targets for handling memoryview objects appropriately to resolve the reported issue.",
