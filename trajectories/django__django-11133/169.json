This class includes methods for initializing the response, setting and getting content, and handling bytes conversion. Notably, the HttpResponse class attempts to handle different types of content, including bytes, strings, and iterables, but does not explicitly handle memoryview objects, which is likely causing the issue. The 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' file contains the BinaryField class, which is used for storing raw binary data.

Given these results, it is clear that the HttpResponse class needs to be updated to properly handle memoryview objects, and this update would be the primary focus for addressing the reported issue.",
