The search results provided include relevant parts of the django/http/response.py file, particularly the __init__ and content methods of the HttpResponse class. The __init__ method sets the content attribute without any specific handling for memoryview objects, and the content property joins the container elements to form the response content.

The current implementation of HttpResponse in Django's response.py does not handle memoryview objects correctly, leading to incorrect output such as the memory address rather than the content. To address this, the relevant code spans need to be identified in the HttpResponse class and the make_bytes method, which is crucial for converting input values into bytes. Additionally, examining the OGRGeometry class in gis/gdal/geometries.py where memoryview objects are explicitly handled could provide insights into correct handling methods. The identified spans include the HttpResponse class, particularly the content setter method and the make_bytes method, as well as the OGRGeometry class's handling of memoryview objects. These segments should be examined and potentially modified to ensure proper handling of memoryview objects.",
