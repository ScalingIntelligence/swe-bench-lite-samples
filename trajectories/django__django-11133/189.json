Similarly, in the 'write' method, where 'make_bytes' is called, there's no specific handling for memoryview objects. This suggests that the current implementation may not correctly process memoryview objects, aligning with the issue reported. Therefore, to fully address the issue, further investigation into the handling of memoryview objects within the 'make_bytes' method and potentially other related methods is necessary.
