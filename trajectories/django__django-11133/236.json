The current implementation of HttpResponse in Django does not handle memoryview objects correctly, which is evident from the provided context in 'django/http/response.py' where the 'HttpResponse' class and its methods are defined. The 'make_bytes' method within the 'HttpResponseBase' class might be a key area to investigate, as it is responsible for converting various types of content into bytes.

The current behavior does not correctly process memoryview objects, resulting in unexpected output. \n\nGiven the search results, it's apparent that the relevant code spans reside within the 'HttpResponse' class definition. Notably, the '__init__' method sets the initial content, and the 'content' property is responsible for returning the content as bytes. Additionally, the 'write' method appends content after converting it to bytes using 'make_bytes'. These methods are crucial for understanding how content is being handled within HttpResponse and necessary for making any changes or extensions to support memoryview objects.\n\nTo effectively address the issue, the identified spans within the 'HttpResponse' class will need to be adjusted. Specifically, it is likely that the handling of content during the initialization and writing phases, as well as the transformation at the property level, should be considered to properly accommodate memoryview types.",
