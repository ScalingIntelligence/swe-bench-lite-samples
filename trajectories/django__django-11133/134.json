Django's HttpResponse class should handle memoryview objects properly to return the correct byte content. The provided search results and context include several relevant sections. The 'django/core/files/base.py' file already contains a 'ContentFile' class that deals with binary content, but it does not specifically handle memoryview objects. In the 'django/utils/encoding.py' file, the 'force_bytes' function has specific handling for memoryview objects, converting them to bytes. This function seems relevant to the issue as it directly addresses the conversion of memoryview to bytes, which is the expected behavior in the HttpResponse. Since the 'force_bytes' function already handles memoryview objects, it might be useful to apply this function to the memoryview content before passing it to HttpResponse to ensure the content is always in the bytes format. This integration could solve the issue of HttpResponse not handling memoryview objects correctly. Additionally, the 'django/utils/encoding.py' file also contains 'smart_bytes' which indirectly deals with converting inputs to bytes, further reinforcing its relevance. The search results do not need to look for further sections within the identified files as they already contain relevant functionalities.",

Additionally, the ContentFile class in django.core.files.base.py handles content of various types and converts memoryview objects indirectly through the stream_class used for initialization.
