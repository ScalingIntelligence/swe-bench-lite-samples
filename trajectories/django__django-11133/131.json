The 'make_bytes' method in HttpResponseBase attempts to convert various types of content (including bytes and str) into bytes, but it doesn't explicitly address memoryview objects. The current implementation in 'content.setter' will iterate over the content if it's not a simple bytes or str type, but this might not correctly handle memoryview objects.
