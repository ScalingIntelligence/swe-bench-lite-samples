The problem occurs when the content of a BinaryField from the database (returned as a memoryview object in PostgreSQL) is passed to HttpResponse. The expected behavior is for HttpResponse to correctly handle memoryview objects and return their byte content. To resolve this, focus on the HttpResponse class and its methods that interact with content, such as the 'content' property and the 'write' method. Additionally, look into how BinaryField handles data conversion, especially for different database backends like PostgreSQL.",

Therefore, the focus should be on identifying the relevant parts in the provided search results that pertain to the HttpResponse and BinaryField handling.\n\nIn the 'django/http/response.py' file, the span 'HttpResponse.content' is particularly relevant as it deals directly with the content of the response. The 'make_bytes' method within the 'HttpResponseBase' class is also crucial, as it is responsible for converting the content to bytes. The 'write' method in the 'HttpResponse' class modifies the content which could also be relevant.\n\nIn the 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' file, the 'BinaryField' class and its methods 'to_python' and 'get_db_prep_value' are relevant to the issue. These methods handle the conversion and preparation of the binary data from the database, which could be in the form of a memoryview object.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant spans from the search results are those which deal directly with the content handling in HttpResponse and the processing of BinaryField data.",
