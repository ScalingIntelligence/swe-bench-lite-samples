            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the HttpResponse not handling memoryview objects correctly in Django. The search results provide a detailed look into the HttpResponse class in Django's http.response module. Three critical spans that align with the issue are identified:\n\n1. The '__init__' method of the HttpResponse class where the content is initially set. This method accepts content which is supposed to be handled correctly regardless of its type. This is relevant because the user is trying to pass a memoryview object to the HttpResponse.\n\n2. The 'content' property of the HttpResponse class. This property should ideally return the content in the correct format when accessed. The user's expectation is that this property would return bytes equivalent to the memoryview object's content rather than a string representation of the memoryview object.\n\n3. The 'write' method of the HttpResponse class accepts content to be appended to the existing content. This method is also relevant because it directly touches on how content, possibly including memoryview objects, is handled within the HttpResponse. It uses the 'make_bytes' method to convert the content to bytes, suggesting a potential area for improvement or correction to properly handle memoryview objects.\n\nThe presence of the 'make_bytes' method, which is likely responsible for converting content to bytes before appending, offers insight into where the handling of memoryview objects might be breaking down. Understanding how this method processes input types, especially memoryview, is crucial for identifying the root cause of the issue. The provided code spans give a clear outline of where to look next to troubleshoot and potentially fix the handling of memoryview objects in the context of HttpResponse.",
