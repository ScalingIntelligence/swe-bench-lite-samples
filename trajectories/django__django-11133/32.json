The current implementation of HttpResponseBase and HttpResponse classes in the search results includes methods for handling content, such as 'make_bytes' and the property setter 'content'. The 'make_bytes' method currently supports bytes and str types but does not explicitly handle memoryview objects. Inspecting the 'content' property setter in the HttpResponse class, it appears to process iterables that are not bytes or str, but it does not specifically check for memoryview objects. This oversight could be the reason why the memoryview objects are not handled correctly as per the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to focus on for addressing this issue are the 'make_bytes' method and the 'content' property setter in the HttpResponse class.",
