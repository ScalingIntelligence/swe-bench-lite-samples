To address this, we need to look for code in the HttpResponse class that processes content. \n\nFrom the search results, we can see that the HttpResponse class is defined and includes methods such as __init__ and write, which are relevant to handling content. The response to memoryview content is not working correctly, so we need to focus on the parts of the code where content is set and accessed.\n\nThe span ids 'HttpResponse' and 'HttpResponse.__init__' are relevant because they define how content is initialized and managed. The 'HttpResponse.content' span is also important as it defines how the content is accessed. The 'HttpResponse.write' span is relevant because it describes how content is written to the response. These spans give us a comprehensive view of how content is managed in the HttpResponse class, which is crucial for resolving the reported issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, it appears we have found the relevant code spans in the search results that address the reported issue.",
