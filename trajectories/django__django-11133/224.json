The current behavior results in the memoryview object itself being returned as the response content instead of the expected byte representation. This discrepancy occurs when dealing with BinaryField data from a PostgreSQL database, which returns data as memoryview objects. To address this, we need to investigate how HttpResponse processes and converts different types of content, particularly focusing on the make_bytes method in the HttpResponseBase class, which might be the point of conversion. Additionally, looking into the BinaryField's get_db_prep_value method in the context of PostgreSQL could provide insights into why memoryview objects are being returned and how they might be better handled.",
