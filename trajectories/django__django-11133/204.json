The current behavior treats memoryview objects as strings, which leads to the content being rendered as '<memory at 0x...>' instead of the expected byte content. This is problematic when dealing with binary data from databases like Postgresql, which sometimes returns data as memoryview objects. To address this, the HttpResponse class or its related classes need to correctly interpret memoryview objects as bytes. I have reviewed the current file context and the new search results to find relevant code spans. The 'HttpResponseBase' class and the 'HttpResponse' class are key here. The 'make_bytes' method in 'HttpResponseBase' is crucial as it converts the content to bytes. However, it currently does not handle memoryview objects explicitly. Similarly, the '__init__' and 'content' properties of 'HttpResponse' also need to account for memoryview objects correctly. I have identified these spans as relevant to addressing the issue.",
