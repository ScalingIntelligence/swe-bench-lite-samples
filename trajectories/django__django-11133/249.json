The current implementation of HttpResponse does not handle memoryview objects properly, causing the content to be rendered as '<memory at 0x...>' instead of the actual binary data it should represent. The goal is to identify sections of code in the search results that are related to the construction and handling of HttpResponse objects, particularly where they interact with the content. The search results include the definition of the HttpResponse class and its initialization method (__init__), which sets the content. Additionally, there's a section in the BinaryField class which includes a method to_python that converts a string to a memoryview object. This method could be relevant to how data from a BinaryField is processed before being sent in an HttpResponse. Therefore, both of these sections could be crucial for addressing the reported issue.",

The issue mentioned involves handling `memoryview` objects, which are not explicitly supported in the current implementation of `HttpResponse`.
