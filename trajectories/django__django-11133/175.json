The current implementation of `HttpResponse` does not handle `memoryview` objects correctly, as evidenced by the output being a memory address rather than the expected byte content.\n\nIn the search results, the following sections appear relevant:\n- `HttpResponse.__init__` where the content is initialized. This method sets `self.content` directly without checking or converting the type of `content`.\n- `HttpResponse.content` which is a property that returns the content as a joined byte string. This suggests that the content is stored as a list of byte strings, which is suitable for handling bytes but not necessarily for a `memoryview`.\n- `BinaryField.to_python` where the field converts the value to a `memoryview` if it is a string. This indicates that the `BinaryField` might be producing `memoryview` objects when interacting with databases that store binary data differently, such as PostgreSQL.\n\nGiven these findings, it seems necessary to enhance the `HttpResponse` class to handle `memoryview` objects or to ensure that the `BinaryField` in PostgreSQL cases returns a compatible type for `HttpResponse`.",
