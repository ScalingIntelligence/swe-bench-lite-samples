However, the current implementation of `make_bytes` does not include handling for `memoryview` objects, which explains why the content of the HTTP response becomes corrupted when a `memoryview` object (typically from a PostgreSQL database) is used as input. To fix this issue, we need to extend the `make_bytes` method to support `memoryview` objects and convert them appropriately to bytes. Additionally, while the current search did not yield any relevant results in middleware files, it's possible there are other areas in the Django framework where `memoryview` objects might be handled, so further investigation might still be necessary if other parts of the system are affected.",
