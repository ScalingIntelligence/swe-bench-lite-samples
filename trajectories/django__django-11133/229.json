From the provided context, it is evident that Django's HttpResponse class does not correctly handle memoryview objects when they are used as content. This discrepancy occurs when transitioning between different database types (Sqlite and Postgresql), with Postgresql returning binary data as memoryview objects. It is crucial to pinpoint where and how Django's HttpResponse class processes and interprets content to resolve this issue. To address this, we need to specifically search for the handling logic within the HttpResponse class and related classes where content might be processed, ensuring support for memoryview objects.",

I analyzed the provided search results to identify the relevant code spans. In 'django/http/response.py', the HttpResponse class and its methods like __init__, content, and write are relevant, as they directly deal with the content that HttpResponse handles. The content property and write method handle the conversion and appending of content to the response, which might need adjustments to correctly manage memoryview objects. In 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', the BinaryField class and its methods, especially to_python, are relevant as they are responsible for handling and converting binary data including potentially memoryview objects. The to_python method converts string data to a memoryview, which suggests a point where the handling may be modified or extended.
