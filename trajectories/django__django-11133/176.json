The provided context indicates that the problem arises when attempting to write a BinaryField retrieved from a PostgreSQL database into a HttpResponse. PostgreSQL returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object, which HttpResponse does not handle correctly. Based on the context, it appears that the HttpResponse class's `write` and `content` methods might be responsible for handling the conversion. However, currently, when a memoryview object is passed, it fails to convert it properly. To resolve this, we need to locate the relevant part of the HttpResponse class code and possibly the BinaryField handling within the database connection, especially for PostgreSQL. Since the issue is specific to memoryview objects and BinaryField, these should be the focus of the search parameters.",

The `to_python` method is particularly relevant, as it converts string values to memoryview objects, which aligns with the issue description. Additionally, the `get_db_prep_value` method might also be relevant as it handles the conversion of field values for database storage, which could influence how data is retrieved and subsequently handled by HttpResponse.

Specifically, when the database is Postgresql and returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object, the HttpResponse does not process it correctly, resulting in the content being shown as a memory address rather than the actual binary data. To address this, we need to identify where and how HttpResponse handles content and ensure that it can correctly process memoryview objects. From the provided file context, we see that BinaryField in Django's models can return a memoryview object. Therefore, we need to focus on the HttpResponse class in the search results to see how content is processed. The relevant spans in the search results are the ones dealing with content handling in the HttpResponse class, specifically 'HttpResponse.__init__', 'HttpResponse.content', and 'HttpResponse.make_bytes'. These spans show how HttpResponse initializes content, how the content property is managed, and how content is converted to bytes. However, the current implementation of 'HttpResponse.make_bytes' does not explicitly handle memoryview objects, which is likely causing the issue. Therefore, these spans are relevant to the reported issue and should be considered for further investigation or modification to handle memoryview objects.",

The current implementation of HttpResponse.content does not correctly handle memoryview objects, leading to unexpected content in the response. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the content handling in HttpResponse and potentially the BinaryField handling. From the provided file context and search results, we can see that the HttpResponse class in django/http/response.py is responsible for handling the response content. The spans 'HttpResponse.content' and 'HttpResponse.content_3' are particularly relevant, as they define the property and setter for the content attribute. Additionally, since the issue involves BinaryField, the spans related to BinaryField in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py, such as 'BinaryField' and 'BinaryField.to_python', are also relevant. These spans indicate where the conversion of field data to a Python object occurs, which might impact how memoryview objects are processed. The search results confirm the presence of HttpResponse and its methods related to content handling, which will be crucial for implementing any changes to properly handle memoryview objects. It appears that the search task is complete, as we have identified the relevant files and code spans that are central to the reported issue.",
