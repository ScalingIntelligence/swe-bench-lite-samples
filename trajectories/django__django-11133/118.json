            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue regarding HttpResponse not handling memoryview objects, it's crucial to first identify the point in Django's codebase where the conversion from different content types to bytes happens for the HttpResponse object. The initial search results provide critical insights into the HttpResponse class and its methods such as '__init__' and 'write'. These methods are responsible for initializing the response object with content and writing content to the response, respectively. Noting that the '__init__' method of HttpResponse suggests it only directly handles byte-like objects but not memoryview objects, it implies a potential gap or need for an explicit conversion. Additionally, examining the BinaryField class in the search results is important because it deals with binary data handling, and its 'to_python' method converts a string value to a memoryview object. This method might be the point where memoryview objects could potentially be handled or converted before being passed to HttpResponse. Based on these analyses, the relevance of the 'HttpResponse.__init__' and 'BinaryField.to_python' code spans is evident since they directly relate to the content handling and binary data conversion, respectively, which are central to the reported issue. Thus, these spans are identified as relevant code portions where potential adjustments might need to be made to ensure HttpResponse can handle memoryview objects appropriately.",
