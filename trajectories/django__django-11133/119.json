The current behavior is that HttpResponse does not correctly handle memoryview objects, leading to unexpected output. By examining the provided search results, specifically the sections related to HttpResponse and its handling of content, we can identify relevant code spans.\n\nThe span with id 'HttpResponse.__init__' shows how the content is initially set, and the span with id 'HttpResponse.content' shows the property where the content is retrieved. Additionally, the method 'HttpResponse.write' appears relevant, as it might need to be adjusted to handle memoryview objects properly. The method 'make_bytes' in 'HttpResponseBase' is also crucial, as it directly deals with converting various types of content to bytes.\n\nThis analysis suggests that 'make_bytes' is the most likely candidate for modification to support memoryview objects. However, reviewing the 'write' method and the '__init__' section of HttpResponse are also important to ensure the content handling process is comprehensive.",
