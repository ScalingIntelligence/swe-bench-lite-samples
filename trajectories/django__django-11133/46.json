The search results reveal the implementation of the HttpResponse class in Django, specifically focusing on how the content is managed within the class. The relevant code spans seem to be the __init__ method, where the content is set, and the content property, which is supposed to return the content of the response as bytes. Additionally, the write method is also of interest as it deals with appending content to the response.
