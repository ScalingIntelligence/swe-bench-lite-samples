The issue suggests that the current method does not handle memoryview objects properly, as the expected output is not achieved. The most relevant code span is the 'HttpResponse.content_3' span where the content conversion happens. This span needs to be modified to handle memoryview objects correctly.

The identified spans in the search results cover the necessary parts of the HttpResponse class, including the content setter, the method to convert values to bytes (make_bytes), and the initialization of the HttpResponse. These sections are essential for addressing the issue, as they directly deal with how the content is handled and set in the HttpResponse.

Additionally, the `content` setter method processes content by either joining an iterable of chunks or directly converting the value to bytes if it's not an iterable. Since `make_bytes` is used in the `content` setter, it's crucial to examine this method more closely to understand how memoryview objects might be handled here. Furthermore, since documentation or external resources were mentioned, it's important to see if there's any documentation or existing issues that explain or discuss the handling of memoryview objects in HttpResponse, as their context could directly influence the solution approach.
