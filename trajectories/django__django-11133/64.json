The initial file context provided shows relevant parts of the `HttpResponse` class but does not explicitly show the handling of `memoryview` objects. The new search results contain multiple spans that may be relevant to the issue: the `HttpResponseBase.__init__` method, which initializes the `HttpResponseBase` object, and the `HttpResponseBase.make_bytes` method, which converts the content to bytes. These methods are crucial for processing incoming content, including `memoryview` objects, indicating that the search is heading in the right direction.
