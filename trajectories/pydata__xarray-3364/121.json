            "scratch_pad": "The issue describes a problem with concatenating xarray Datasets that have different variables. It suggests that the current `xray.concat` function requires users to either create dummy variables filled with NaN or drop mismatched variables, which isn't ideal. The enhancement proposed is for `concat` to handle this automatically, similar to how `pd.concat` performs an outer join on DataFrames with different variables. To address this issue, it is necessary to focus on the `concat` functionality within the xarray library, specifically searching for the implementation of `concat` across the relevant modules such as `concat.py`, `combine.py`, and `dataset.py`. Additionally, functions like `_calc_concat_over`, `_dataset_concat`, and `_dataarray_concat` which are involved in concatenation operations should be inspected for potential improvements. Moreover, since the issue mentions consistency with `pd.concat`, it might also be useful to look at how pandas handles the concatenation of DataFrames with different columns.",

The current implementation requires users to manually handle mismatched variables by creating dummy variables filled with NaN or dropping mismatched variables, which is not ideal. The search results reveal several relevant functions and spans of code within `xarray/core/concat.py` and `xarray/core/combine.py`. These include the `concat` function itself, which is responsible for concatenating datasets along a specified dimension. There are also helper functions like `_dataset_concat` and `_dataarray_concat` that handle the specifics of concatenating datasets and data arrays, respectively. Additionally, functions like `_calc_concat_over` and `_combine_1d` provide deeper insights into how variables and coordinates are handled during concatenation. The `combine_nested` and `combine_by_coords` functions in `combine.py` also suggest that these functions may be relevant for more complex combination scenarios. The relevance of these code spans lies in their direct involvement in the concatenation and combination of datasets, which is central to addressing the reported issue. By analyzing these functions, we can understand the current behavior and potentially identify areas where modifications could be made to improve handling of datasets with different variables.",

It also includes functions such as `_calc_concat_over` and `_dataset_concat` which deal with concatenation operations. However, although the current logic includes handling of concatenation, it appears to lack an explicit option to ignore missing variables and automatically fill them with NaN, which is the enhancement proposed in the issue. This suggests that while the relevant code for the concatenation operation exists, it may need modifications to implement the proposed enhancement. Additionally, the file context lacks direct reference to the issue's request to align with `pd.concat`'s outer join behavior for consistency, which could indicate further areas where the code might need improvements or additional implementations that are not covered in the file context provided.

I examined the 'concat' function and associated helper functions (_calc_concat_over, _dataset_concat, _dataarray_concat) from the search results. These functions orchestrate the process by aligning datasets, determining what to concat over, and handling differences in variables and coordinates. The search results validate these functions in the context of the reported issue, ensuring that the current implementation aligns with the requirement of handling missing variables gracefully. As a result, the search results fully address the reported issue, identifying key aspects of the current implementation that align with the need for improved concatenation handling in xarray.",

The provided code also includes a mechanism for aligning datasets and handling missing variables.

The proposed change is to modify the `concat` function to include an option to handle mismatched variables automatically, which can be achieved by updating the `_calc_concat_over` function to handle variables that are not present in all datasets.

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
