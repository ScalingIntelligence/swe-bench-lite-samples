The analysis of the search results reveals the core function handling concatenation in the `xarray` library, primarily located in `xarray/core/concat.py`. Key spans of code identified include the main `concat` function, which processes different types of objects (DataArrays and Datasets), and the internal `_dataset_concat` function, which plays a crucial role in concatenating Datasets specifically. The implementation in `_dataset_concat` already includes handling of various parameters such as `compat`, `fill_value`, and `join`, and it aligns with the issue's requirement to handle mismatched variables without explicitly needing to add dummy NaN fields or drop variables. Other relevant spans include the `_dataarray_concat` function and the `Variable.concat` method in `xarray/core/variable.py`, though they do not directly address the issue's core concern of variable mismatch handling during concatenation.",

However, the current implementation seems to explicitly check for the presence of all variables in all datasets before concatenation, which is the reason for the user's complaint. To address the reported issue, one would need to modify these functions to more gracefully handle missing variables, potentially by filling in missing values or performing an outer join as suggested.

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
