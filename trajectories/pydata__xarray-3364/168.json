The current implementation of `xray.concat` requires users to create dummy variables filled with NaN or drop mismatched variables. The desired functionality is to have `concat` handle these missing variables automatically, similar to `pd.concat`'s outer join approach. From the search results, several relevant code spans were identified: 'xarray/core/merge.py - merge' for general merge functionality, 'xarray/core/dataset.py - Dataset.merge' for Dataset-specific merge logic, 'xarray/core/concat.py - concat' for core concatenation logic, and 'xarray/core/variable.py - Variable.concat' and 'IndexVariable.concat' for concatenation of variables and index variables respectively. These spans contain the fundamental code for concatenating datasets and handling variables in xarray, which are highly relevant to the reported issue. Further analysis could involve examining how `merge` and `concat` functions handle differing variables and how they align with the current user needs addressed by the issue.",

Additionally, related functions and classes in `xarray/core/merge.py` and `xarray/core/dataset.py` offer context on how merging and concatenation might be handled in the broader scope of the xarray module. The presence of these files and functions suggests that the relevant code for the issue might be spread across these files, indicating that modifications to the `concat` function, as well as potentially reviewing or adjusting merge strategies within the `Dataset` class, could be necessary. However, while the core functionality and related methods are mentioned, detailed logic for handling different variables within the `concat` function itself (such as explicitly adding an option to handle missing variables) is not fully detailed in the provided context.

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
