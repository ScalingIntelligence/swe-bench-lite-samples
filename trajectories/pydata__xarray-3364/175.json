This is seen as an inconvenience and inconsistent with the approach of pd.concat, which performs an outer join. The objective is to enhance xarray.concat to handle this more gracefully by default, potentially aligning it with pd.concat's behavior.\n\nFrom a detailed examination of the search results, the relevant sections of code primarily focus on the `xarray.concat` function and related utilities. These sections define how the concatenation function operates, including how it handles different parameters and objects, such as Datasets and DataArrays. Specifically, the code defines the `concat` function in 'xarray/core/concat.py' and how it subsequently routes to '_dataarray_concat' or '_dataset_concat' based on the type of the first object. It also encompasses the `Variable.concat` and `IndexVariable.concat` methods in 'xarray/core/variable.py', which detail the internal mechanics of concatenating variables and index variables, respectively. Moreover, there's a mention of the 'join' parameter in the `concat` function, suggesting it might be pertinent to the issue since 'outer' join is the preferred method mentioned in the issue.\n\nTaken together, these sections provide a comprehensive view of how concatenation currently works in xarray and highlight potential points for improvement: the handling of different variables and the use of 'outer' join by default, addressing the core of the reported issue.",

This issue is directly related to the current implementation of the 'concat' function in xarray, specifically how it handles the combination of datasets with differing variables.In the search results, several key areas are relevant to address this issue:\n\n1. The 'concat' function definition in 'xarray/core/concat.py' shows the current implementation and logic for concatenating objects in xarray. This includes checks for compatibility and the type of the objects being concatenated (either DataArray or Dataset).\n\n2. Within the 'concat' function, there is specific handling for Datasets (_dataset_concat) and DataArrays (_dataarray_concat). Both of these functions are critical to understand how different variables are currently handled.\n\n3. The '_dataset_concat' function includes parsing of datasets and calculation of which variables should be concatenated over. It also involves a method to ensure common dimensions, which is crucial for maintaining consistency during the concatenation process.\n\n4. The '_calc_concat_dim_coord' function is responsible for determining the coordinate to use along the concatenation dimension, which can influence how missing variables are treated.\n\nGiven these findings, the key areas of code that need adjustment or enhancement to address the issue are the '_dataset_concat' function and possibly the 'concat' function itself, to introduce a more 'relaxed' approach similar to that of 'pd.concat', which does an outer join on differing variables. However, the search results do not directly show how missing variables are currently handled, and thus do not provide a direct modification point without further analysis. Future modifications should focus on ensuring that concatenation can handle mismatched variables by aligning them on an outer join basis, possibly filling missing values with NaN.",
