The suggestion is to have an option (possibly the default) within `concat` to take care of this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` which does an outer join.\n\nAfter examining the search results, it's clear that the relevant files are `xarray/core/concat.py` and `xarray/core/merge.py`. The `concat` function in `concat.py` is the main focus, as it already includes parameters like `data_vars`, `coords`, `compat`, and `join` which could potentially be adjusted to include a default behavior that resolves the issue as described. Additionally, the `merge_core` and `merge` functions in `merge.py` also interact with these concepts and might need adjustments to fully implement the suggested enhancement.\n\nThe identified spans provide a good starting point.

The `concat` function in `concat.py` and the `merge_core` function in `merge.py` are directly relevant as they are responsible for handling concatenation and merging operations. However, the current implementation of `concat` does not include handling missing variables beyond setting a default join strategy as 'outer'. To fully address the issue, modifications would likely involve adjusting how `concat` and `merge_core` handle mismatched variables. Specifically, `concat` would need options to manage missing variables without requiring users to manually fill with NaN or drop variables.

Currently, the function requires users to manually handle mismatched variables by either creating dummy variables filled with NaN or dropping mismatched variables entirely. This is undesirable and inconsistent with the behavior of `pd.concat`, which performs an outer join. The issue suggests that `xray.concat` should have an option (or default behavior) to handle this automatically. Upon reviewing the code, the `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` is indeed the focal point for addressing this issue. The `merge_core` and `merge` functions in `xarray/core/merge.py` also seem relevant as they deal with joining datasets, which could be leveraged to improve the `concat` function's behavior. Additionally, the `join` parameter in the `concat` function is set to 'outer' in the provided context, which aligns with the desired behavior mentioned in the issue. The `merge_core` function's handling of the `join` parameter suggests it could be used to implement the desired functionality if integrated into the `concat` function. Thus, the identified spans are crucial for addressing the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Ignore missing variables when concatenating datasets?\nSeveral users (@raj-kesavan, @richardotis, now myself) have wondered about how to concatenate xray Datasets with different variables.\n\nWith the current `xray.concat`, you need to awkwardly create dummy variables filled with `NaN` in datasets that don't have them (or drop mismatched variables entirely). Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
