The current implementation requires manual intervention to handle missing variables, either by creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or by dropping mismatched variables entirely. The user suggests that `concat` should have an option to handle this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` which does an outer join by default. The relevant functions to investigate are those related to concatenation and merging within the xarray library, particularly those in the `concat`, `combine`, `dataset`, `merge`, `alignment`, and `variable` modules. Special attention should be paid to the `concat` and `merge` functions and their respective parameters.",

The current behavior requires the user to create dummy variables filled with `NaN` or drop mismatched variables, which is inconvenient. The request is to make `concat` behave more like `pd.concat`, which does an outer join by default. \n\nLooking at the provided search results, there are several relevant sections of code that deal with concatenation and merging of datasets. These include functions like `concat`, `combine_nested`, `combine_by_coords`, and `auto_combine` in `xarray/core/combine.py`, as well as the `merge` function in `xarray/core/merge.py`. Each of these functions involves handling datasets and variables, which could be extended or modified to better align with the user's request for handling mismatched variables more gracefully.\n\nThe `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` is particularly relevant as it directly involves the concatenation of objects, including Datasets and DataArrays. The function has parameters for handling compatibility, data variables, coordinates, and fill values, which indicate it has flexibility for customization. This function could potentially be modified to include an option or a default behavior change regarding how mismatched variables are handled during concatenation.\n\nIn summary, the key functions to focus on within the provided code are those related to concatenation and merging as they directly handle the operations described in the reported issue. Modifying these functions to have a behavior more akin to `pd.concat` for handling mismatched variables would be a direct solution to the user's request.",

The `merge.py` file defines the `merge` function, which handles merging datasets.
