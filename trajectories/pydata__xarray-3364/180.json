This function currently requires that variables be present in all datasets or raises an error. However, the code implements the `join` parameter, which could be used to enable the desired behavior of automatically handling missing variables. Additionally, the `merge` function in `xarray/core/merge.py` and `combine_nested` in `xarray/core/combine.py` are relevant as they handle merging and combining datasets respectively, which can be related to the issue of concatenating datasets with different variables.

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
