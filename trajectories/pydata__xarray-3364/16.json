Additionally, the behavior and parameters of `join` in these functions should be checked to ensure it is set to 'outer' by default if not already.",

The search results contain several relevant code spans in `xarray/core/concat.py`, particularly the `concat`, `_dataset_concat`, and `_dataarray_concat` functions which deal with the concatenation logic for both Dataset and DataArray objects. These functions currently manage alignment, compatibility, and merging of variables. An enhancement might involve adjusting these functions to better handle differing variables by default, perhaps mimicking the outer join behavior of pandas. Additionally, `xarray/core/combine.py` contains functions like `combine_nested` and `combine_by_coords` which could be influenced by changes to the concatenation behavior. These findings are directly relevant to addressing the issue, indicating that the search task can be considered partially complete with further analysis and potential modification required in the identified functions.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
