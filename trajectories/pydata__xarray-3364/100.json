The current implementation requires users to handle mismatched variables by either creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables entirely. The request is for `xray.concat` to handle this automatically, similar to how `pd.concat` operates.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant files and code spans that are directly related to the `concat` functionality in the xarray library. The `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` is the main function used for concatenating datasets and data arrays. It checks the type of the first object to determine whether to use `_dataarray_concat` or `_dataset_concat`. The `concat` method in `xarray/core/variable.py` is also relevant as it is responsible for concatenating variables along a specified dimension. Additionally, the `concat` function in `xarray/core/combine.py` is related to combining datasets nestedly or by coordinates, which is relevant to the overall concatenation process. These code spans provide a comprehensive view of how concatenation is currently implemented and where improvements might be needed to address the reported issue.\n\nBased on the analysis of the reported issue and the provided code spans, it is clear that the search results are relevant and provide a good starting point for addressing the issue.

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
