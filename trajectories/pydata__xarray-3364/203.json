            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on enhancing the `xray.concat` function to handle datasets with different variables more gracefully, akin to `pd.concat`'s approach. The current behavior requires users to manually deal with mismatched variables, either by creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or by dropping mismatched variables. To address this, I analyzed the provided code spans and identified key areas of interest:\n\n1. **xarray/core/concat.py**: This file contains the definition of the `concat` function which is central to the issue. It handles the concatenation of DataArray and Dataset objects. The current implementation requires careful alignment of variables due to the option `compat='equals'`, which might not be flexible enough to handle mismatched variables seamlessly.\n2. **xarray/core/merge.py**: The `merge` function is also relevant as it provides a mechanism to combine datasets with different variables using an outer join, similar to what `pd.concat` does. This functionality could be leveraged to improve the handling of mismatched variables during concatenation.\n3. **xarray/core/variable.py**: This file contains classes and methods related to variables, which are fundamental in handling data for both datasets and arrays. The `Variable.concat` and `IndexVariable.concat` methods are crucial as they define how variables are concatenated along a specified dimension.\n4. **xarray/core/dataset.py**: This file includes the Dataset class, and the `Dataset.merge` method is highlighted as it merges datasets with specified compatibilities, which could be revisited to harmonize with the concatenation functionality.\n5. **xarray/core/coordinates.py**: This file handles coordinates, and the `Coordinates.merge` method is also noted as it merges coordinate variables which might be related to how datasets are concatenated.\n\nThese code spans provide a basis for understanding how current concatenation and merging operations are handled in xarray, which can guide further modifications to support a more automated and user-friendly concatenation of datasets with mismatched variables.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
