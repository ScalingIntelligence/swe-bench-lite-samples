The current behavior requires creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables, which is not ideal. The solution should align more with `pd.concat` which does an outer join. Reviewing the provided code spans from `xarray/core/concat.py`, it is evident that the main function `concat` and helper functions `_dataset_concat` and `_dataarray_concat` are directly related to the concatenation process. These functions handle the main flow of concatenation, including aligning datasets, handling mismatched variables, and setting up the concatenation. From `xarray/core/combine.py`, the functions `_combine_all_along_first_dim`, `_combine_1d`, `combine_nested`, `combine_by_coords`, and `auto_combine` are also relevant as they further facilitate the combination of datasets and involve calling the `concat` function with appropriate parameters. The code spans in both files suggest that the logic for handling mismatched variables during concatenation requires modification to better handle such cases, possibly by implementing an optional parameter like `ignore_missing_vars` that defaults to `False` but can be set to `True` to handle missing variables more gracefully, similar to `pd.concat`.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
