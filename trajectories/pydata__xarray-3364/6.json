The current `xray.concat` function requires users to either create dummy variables filled with `NaN` or drop mismatched variables entirely, which is not ideal. The expectation is for `xray.concat` to handle this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` which performs an outer join. To address this, we need to look for sections of the code related to the `concat` function and how it handles mismatched variables. In the search results, there are three key sections: `xarray/core/dataset.py`, `xarray/core/concat.py`, and `xarray/core/variable.py`. The `xarray/core/concat.py` file contains the `concat` function definition, which is central to the issue. The function checks the type of the first object and delegates to `_dataarray_concat` or `_dataset_concat` accordingly. The `data_vars` and `coords` parameters are relevant, as they determine how variables are handled during concatenation. Additionally, in `xarray/core/variable.py`, there are `concat` methods for `Variable` and `IndexVariable` classes, which deal with the actual concatenation of variables, including handling mismatched dimensions and attributes. These sections are directly relevant to the issue, as they either dictate how concatenation is approached or perform the actual concatenation process. By focusing on these areas, we can identify where improvements are needed to handle mismatched variables more gracefully.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
