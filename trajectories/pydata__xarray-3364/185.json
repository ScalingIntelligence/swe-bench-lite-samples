These functions handle the concatenation of xarray Datasets. The issue at hand is about handling missing variables during concatenation, which aligns with the functionality of these provided functions. However, the broader context of how xarray treats different variables during concatenation needs further exploration, especially considering the similarity in handling by `pd.concat` (outer join approach). This suggests a deeper inquiry into the data variable and coordinate handling mechanisms within xarray, potentially including how merging and alignment functions are implemented. The `xarray/core/dataset.py` file, seen in part, suggests related functionalities, specifically around `merge` and `reindex`, which might also handle variable mismatches or might necessitate modifications for a better cohesive approach to handling differing variables across concatenated datasets. Understanding how these parts interact or might need to integrate for a more flexible concatenation process, similar to pandas, would be crucial. Given the specific functionalities at hand and the direction of the issue, the investigation into more parts of the codebase involving merging and alignment of variables in different datasets should continue. It's plausible that adjustments or improvements might be required in functions that are not exclusively within the provided `concat.py` but also possibly in related handling across dataset methods in `dataset.py`.",
