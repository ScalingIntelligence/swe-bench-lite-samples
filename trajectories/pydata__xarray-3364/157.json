The current implementation requires users to manually handle mismatched variables by either creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables entirely, which is not ideal. The issue suggests that `xray.concat` should handle this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` which performs an outer join by default. The provided search results show the relevant sections of the `xarray` library's `concat` function implementation. Specifically, the `_dataset_concat` function and its helper functions appear to be the core of the concatenation logic for `Dataset` objects. These functions parse the datasets, handle alignment, and concatenate variables over the specified dimension. Additionally, the `_dataarray_concat` function is responsible for similar operations but for `DataArray` objects. Further inspection of these functions reveals that they already support different join methods, including the 'outer' join, but the default behavior may not be as relaxed as desired. Therefore, it seems relevant to identify these sections as they directly relate to the concatenation logic and could be adjusted to better handle mismatched variables automatically.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
