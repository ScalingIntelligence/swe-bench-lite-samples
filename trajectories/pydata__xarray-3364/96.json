It proposes that xarray.concat should handle this automatically, similar to pd.concat. The primary function identified as relevant here is `concat` in xarray/core/concat.py, which is responsible for the concatenation of datasets (both Dataset and DataArray). The function `_dataset_concat` specifically handles the concatenation of Dataset objects and includes logic for handling variables and coordinates during concatenation. This function does not currently have a default option to handle mismatched variables gracefully, which is the feature requested in the issue. Additionally, the `concat` function in xarray/core/variable.py is relevant as it deals with the concatenation of Variable objects, which is a lower-level operation used by `_dataset_concat`. The code for handling variables to merge and the logic for ensuring common dimensions in `_dataset_concat` are particularly relevant to address the reported issue.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
