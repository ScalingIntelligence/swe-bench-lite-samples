The current implementation of `xray.concat` requires users to manually handle missing variables by either creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables. The issue suggests that `concat` should handle this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` which performs an outer join. The key areas to focus on are the `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` and the `merge` function in `xarray/core/merge.py`. The `concat` function is responsible for the concatenation of objects, and the `merge` function is likely involved in combining datasets. By examining these sections, we can determine if the functionality needs to be adjusted or if new logic needs to be added to handle datasets with different variables seamlessly.

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
