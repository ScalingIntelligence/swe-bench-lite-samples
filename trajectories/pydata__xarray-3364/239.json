            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about improving the `xray.concat` function to handle datasets with different variables more gracefully, similar to how `pd.concat` handles dataframes with different columns. The key elements to look for in the code are the `concat` function and related helper functions within the `xarray/core/concat.py` and `xarray/core/variable.py` files. In `xarray/core/concat.py`, the `concat` function is defined along with two helper functions `_dataset_concat` and `_dataarray_concat`, which handle the concatenation of Datasets and DataArrays, respectively. The function `_dataset_concat` is particularly relevant as it includes logic for handling different variables in datasets, checking for variable presence across datasets, and merging variables. In `xarray/core/variable.py`, the `Variable` and `IndexVariable` classes have their own `concat` methods, which are called internally in the `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py`. These methods handle the concatenation of arrays along a specified dimension, which is crucial for implementing the desired functionality to ignore missing variables when concatenating datasets. Given these findings, the identified code spans in `xarray/core/concat.py` (specifically the `_dataset_concat` function) and `xarray/core/variable.py` (specifically the `Variable.concat` and `IndexVariable.concat` methods) are highly relevant to the issue reported, as they directly pertain to the concatenation logic that needs to be improved to better handle datasets with different variables.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
