The current solution involves either creating dummy variables filled with NaN or dropping mismatched variables, which is not ideal. The suggested improvement is to have an option in the `xray.concat` function that automatically handles such cases. It's been noted that `pd.concat` already employs a more relaxed approach, performing an outer join by default, which the users find more convenient for handling different variables during concatenation. To find the relevant code, I will look into the `concat` function and related methods across the provided source files, focusing on the parameters `data_vars`, `coords`, `fill_value`, and `join`, as these are the critical parameters affecting the concatenation of datasets in the cases described.",

In the provided search results, it is clear that the `xarray.concat` function is implemented in the `xarray/core/concat.py` file, specifically in the `concat`, `_dataset_concat`, and `_dataarray_concat` spans. This code handles the concatenation of Datasets and DataArrays, respectively. The function `_calc_concat_dim_coord` is also relevant for determining the dimension over which to concatenate. Additionally, the `xarray/core/variable.py` file contains the `Variable` and `IndexVariable` classes, which define their own `concat` methods. These are pertinent as they would need modification to align with the proposed improvements in the reported issue. Overall, the identified code spans highlight the core functionality that would be targeted for potential enhancements to address the reported issue.",

These functions cover the main aspects of concatenation, including handling different parameters like `data_vars`, `coords`, `fill_value`, and `join`. The code includes detailed logic for aligning datasets and handling concatenations across different dimensions and variables. Given the extensive code provided, it appears that nearly all relevant code necessary to understand and potentially modify the existing concatenation behavior is included in the file context. The provided functionality covers the current state of concatenation, alignment, and handling of missing values, which are central to the issue described. Further, the code suggests that modifications to the `concat` function could introduce options to handle missing variables more flexibly without requiring the user to manually manage missing data through dummy variables or data drops. The majority of key functionalities are covered in the file context, making it possible to understand and possibly modify the existing system to meet user requirements.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
