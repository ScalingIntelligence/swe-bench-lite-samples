The current behavior requires users to manually handle missing variables by either creating dummy variables filled with NaN or dropping mismatched variables. This is seen as inconvenient and inconsistent with `pd.concat`, which performs an outer join by default. The search results provide relevant code spans in `xarray/core/concat.py` and `xarray/core/combine.py`. \n\nIn `xarray/core/concat.py`, the `concat` function and its specialized implementations for Datasets (`_dataset_concat`) and DataArrays (`_dataarray_concat`) are found. These functions handle the concatenation logic, including alignment of datasets, handling of variables and coordinates, and compatibility checks. The `_dataset_concat` function specifically processes datasets to be concatenated, managing variables and coordinates, and ensuring consistent dimensions across datasets. \n\nIn `xarray/core/combine.py`, the `combine_nested` and `combine_by_coords` functions utilize the `concat` function to combine datasets along specified dimensions, handling compatibility and joining logic. These functions are relevant as they also manage the combination of datasets with different variables and could be influenced by the proposed change to `xray.concat`. \n\nThe identified code spans should help in understanding and potentially modifying the concatenation behavior to better handle datasets with different variables, possibly by implementing an outer join for variable matching as suggested in the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about enhancing the `xray.concat` function to handle datasets with different variables more effectively, similar to `pd.concat` which performs an outer join by default. The current implementation requires users to awkwardly create dummy variables filled with `NaN` or drop mismatched variables, which is not ideal. The investigation focused on the `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` and related functions like `_dataset_concat` and `_dataarray_concat`. The key areas examined include the handling of `objs` (datasets to be concatenated), the `join` parameter, and the management of `variables_to_merge`. The search results helped in understanding how the current implementation handles mismatched variables and how it aligns with the desired functionality (an outer join by default). Further investigation of the `merge` function in `xarray/core/merge.py` and the `align` function in `xarray/core/alignment.py` provided insight into how datasets are merged and aligned, which is crucial for understanding how to modify the `concat` function to better handle mismatched variables. The `open_mfdataset` function in `xarray/backends/api.py` was also examined for its handling of multiple datasets and merging strategies. Overall, the analysis was comprehensive, covering multiple areas of the codebase relevant to the reported issue. The findings suggest that modifying the `concat` function to handle mismatched variables more gracefully, akin to `pd.concat`, would likely involve adjustments to the `join` parameter default and the logic for handling `variables_to_merge`.",
