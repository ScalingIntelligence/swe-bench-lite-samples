The current behavior requires users to manually handle mismatched variables by either filling them with NaN or dropping them. Users desire a feature similar to pandas's `pd.concat`, which performs an outer join by default. The relevant files and functions are likely located in the `xarray/core/` directory, specifically looking at `concat.py`, `combine.py`, `dataset.py`, `merge.py`, and potentially others like `dataarray.py`. Target functions include `concat`, `_dataset_concat`, `_dataarray_concat`, and related methods handling concatenation and merging operations. The search should focus on these functions and their parameters to identify where the handling of mismatched variables occurs and how it could be improved for better user experience, including the default behavior.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
