Users are currently forced to either create dummy variables filled with NaN or drop mismatched variables, which is not ideal. The request is to make xarray.concat more user-friendly by handling these situations automatically, similar to how pandas.concat manages dataframes with different variables. Given the context provided, it's evident that several functions in the xarray library are involved in concatenation and merging operations. Specifically, functions like 'concat', '_dataset_concat', and '_dataarray_concat' in 'xarray/core/concat.py', and 'combine_nested', 'combine_by_coords', and 'auto_combine' in 'xarray/core/combine.py', deal with issues related to concatenation.

The search results contain several relevant code spans that deal directly with the concatenation logic in xarray. The `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` is a central piece of code that handles the concatenation of Datasets and DataArrays, and it includes parameters such as `compat` and `join` that are directly related to handling mismatched variables. The `_dataset_concat` function within the same file also contains detailed logic for how to concatenate Datasets, including handling variables and coordinates. Further, the `combine_nested` and `combine_by_coords` functions in `xarray/core/combine.py` also utilize the `concat` function to handle nested combining and combining by coordinate, which could be leveraged for a more user-friendly concatenation process. These functions are likely to be key in implementing the feature request for a more flexible concatenation option.",

  "initial_message": "Ignore missing variables when concatenating datasets?\nSeveral users (@raj-kesavan, @richardotis, now myself) have wondered about how to concatenate xray Datasets with different variables.\n\nWith the current `xray.concat`, you need to awkwardly create dummy variables filled with `NaN` in datasets that don't have them (or drop mismatched variables entirely). Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
