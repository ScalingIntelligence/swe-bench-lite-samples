This behavior is deemed awkward and could be improved to automatically handle such cases, similar to how pandas' pd.concat operates by performing an outer join. Given the detailed context of the issue and the provided functions related to concatenation and merging in xarray, the focus should be on identifying the relevant functions and their implementations within the `concat` and `merge` functionalities in the xarray source code. The goal is to find the exact points where the handling of variables during concatenation is implemented or configured.",

The current implementation of `xray.concat` requires users to either create dummy variables filled with `NaN` or drop mismatched variables, which is not ideal. The search results provide several code spans that are potentially relevant. In `xray/core/concat.py`, the `concat` function definition is found, which is directly related to the issue. Additionally, the `_dataset_concat` and `_dataarray_concat` functions are referenced, indicating they might handle the concatenation logic for Dataset and DataArray objects, respectively. In `xray/core/merge.py`, the `merge` function and related imports are found, suggesting this module might also be involved in handling variable mergers. Finally, in `xray/core/variable.py`, there are class and method definitions for `Variable` and `IndexVariable`, particularly their `concat` methods, which further solidifies the relevance of these code spans to the reported issue. Overall, these code spans provide a good starting point to address the issue of handling mismatched variables during concatenation.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
