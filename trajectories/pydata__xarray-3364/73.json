The current `xray.concat` function requires users to create dummy variables filled with `NaN` or drop mismatched variables entirely, which is inconvenient. The desired behavior is for `concat` to handle this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` which performs an outer join. \n\nInitially, no relevant code has been identified in the file context. \n\nReviewing the search results, several spans of code are relevant to concatenating datasets with different variables. Key functions and sections to note include:\n1. `xarray/core/combine.py` - Functions `_combine_all_along_first_dim`, `_combine_1d`, `_nested_combine`, `combine_nested`, `combine_by_coords`, and `auto_combine` are all involved in combining datasets, which could potentially handle different variables. These functions use `concat` and `merge`, which suggests they might already attempt to align datasets based on the 'outer' join behavior.\n2. `xarray/core/concat.py` - The main `concat` function and imports are present, indicating this is where the core concatenation logic resides.\n3. `xarray/core/dataset.py` - The `Dataset` class and its `reindex`, `merge`, and `combine_first` methods are relevant as they deal with merging and indexing datasets, which are crucial for handling different variables during concatenation.\n4. `xarray/core/alignment.py` - The `align` function is central to coordinating the alignment of datasets before concatenation, which is crucial for handling mismatched variables.\n\nThe collection of spans highlighted in these files provides a comprehensive view of the code involved in concatenating datasets, which includes key methods and functions that directly address the core functionality related to the reported issue.",

The search results confirm the relevance of `concat` and `merge` functions across multiple files (`xarray/core/concat.py`, `xarray/core/merge.py`, `xarray/core/dataset.py`), reinforcing the focus on these operations. 4. The analysis highlights specific code spans in the search results that are directly related to concatenation and merging logic, which are the key focus areas to address the reported issue. 5.

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
