The desired behavior is for `xray.concat` to handle this scenario more gracefully, similar to `pd.concat`. Given the context, it's apparent that the core logic for concatenation is spread across various files within the `xarray` package, such as `concat.py`, `combine.py`, and `dataset.py`. The primary focus should be on functions like `concat`, `_dataset_concat`, and `_dataarray_concat`, which handle the concatenation logic. Additionally, attention should be given to how these functions interact with data variables and coordinates.",

This aligns with the behavior of `pd.concat`, which performs an outer join. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals several key functions and classes relevant to this issue: `concat` in `xarray/core/concat.py` defines the primary concatenation function, handling both `Dataset` and `DataArray` objects and includes parameters such as `data_vars`, `coords`, `compat`, and `join`. The current implementation raises a ValueError if variables are present in some datasets but not others, which precisely aligns with the user's reported issue. Additionally, the `_dataset_concat` function contains the logic for concatenating Dataset objects, which includes the handling of different variables and coordinates. The code in `xarray/core/variable.py` demonstrates the `Variable.concat` and `IndexVariable.concat` methods that are likely utilized by the higher-level `concat` function. Overall, these code spans directly address the reported issue by revealing the core functions and classes involved in the concatenation process and the specific logic related to handling datasets with differing variables.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
