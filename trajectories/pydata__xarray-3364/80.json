            "scratch_pad": "Analysis of the issue reveals a requirement for xarray's `concat` function to handle concatenation of Datasets with different variables more gracefully, similar to pandas' behavior. Key points from the reported issue are: 1. The need for `concat` to automatically handle missing variables by filling with `NaN` or by performing an outer join. 2. The current implementation requires users to manually handle mismatched variables, which is not ideal. 3. The issue suggests that the `concat` function should have an option to manage this automatically. The search results show relevant code spans across several files: `xarray/core/concat.py`, `xarray/core/variable.py`, `xarray/core/coordinates.py`, `xarray/core/dataset.py`, and `xarray/core/merge.py`. These files contain the core logic for dataset and variable concatenation, alignment, and merging. Specifically, the `concat` function definition in `xarray/core/concat.py` is central to the solution, as it currently lacks the capability to handle mismatched variables automatically. Other spans in `xarray/core/variable.py` related to `Variable.concat` and `IndexVariable.concat` are also pertinent as they deal with the concatenation of individual variables. The `merge` functions in `xarray/core/coordinates.py` and `xarray/core/dataset.py` are also relevant as they deal with merging coordinates and datasets, which is closely related to concatenation. The identified spans together provide a comprehensive view of the current implementation and suggest where improvements can be made to achieve the desired behavior.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
