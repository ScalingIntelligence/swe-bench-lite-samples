The current approach requires creating dummy variables filled with NaN or dropping mismatched variables, which is inconvenient. This enhancement should align with the behavior of `pd.concat`, performing an outer join by default to combine datasets. Relevant files identified contain functions like `_dataset_concat`, `_dataarray_concat`, and `_combine_1d` which are likely to be involved in the concatenation process. Focusing on these functions should help in understanding and addressing the issue.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
