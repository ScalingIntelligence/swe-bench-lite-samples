The main focus is on the `concat` function and related helper functions in both `xarray/core/concat.py` and `xarray/core/variable.py`. These files contain the core logic for concatenation and offer opportunities to adjust the behavior to match user expectations, especially allowing for missing variables and handling them in a manner similar to `pd.concat`. The `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` has several spans that are crucial for understanding how datasets are currently concatenated and how we might adapt them to ignore missing variables. Similarly, the `Variable.concat` method in `xarray/core/variable.py` is responsible for concatenating individual variables, which is also a key area for potential modifications. By examining these spans, we can pinpoint where adjustments are needed to implement a more forgiving concatenation process that doesn't require the creation of dummy variables filled with `NaN` or the dropping of mismatched variables.",

The current implementation of `xray.concat` requires either creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables, which is considered awkward and not user-friendly.\n\nThe provided context includes key functions `concat`, `_calc_concat_over`, `_parse_datasets`, and `_dataset_concat` from `xarray/core/concat.py`, which are central to the concatenation logic. Additionally, there are `concat` methods within `xarray/core/variable.py` that handle concatenation of variables.\n\nThe new search results add further context from `xarray/core/merge.py` and `xarray/core/alignment.py`. The `merge_core` function in `merge.py` deals with merging datasets, which could be relevant for handling mismatched variables. The `align` function in `alignment.py` is used for aligning datasets, which is likely where missing variables could be handled either by filling with `NaN` or by performing an outer join. \n\nGiven the identified functions and methods within the `xarray/core` directory, it seems appropriate to focus on these areas for implementing the desired functionality. The `concat` and `align` functions, as well as the merging logic, appear to be the most relevant places for making changes or adding new options to handle missing variables gracefully.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
