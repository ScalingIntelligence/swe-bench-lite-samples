            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the functionality of `xray.concat` in xarray, specifically the need to handle concatenation of Datasets with different variables more gracefully. The current behavior requires users to create dummy variables filled with NaN or drop mismatched variables. The goal is to make `xray.concat` more user-friendly by incorporating an option to handle these inconsistencies, possibly by default, which is more aligned with `pd.concat`. Thus, relevant code spans include those handling the core concat logic, namely the `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py`, and the supplementary functions `_dataset_concat` and `_dataarray_concat` it calls. Additionally, given the desire for better alignment with `pd.concat`, the `merge` function and related methods in `xarray/core/merge.py` are also pertinent, particularly `merge_data_and_coords` and `merge_core`, which deal with merging logic analogous to concatenation. This analysis can be expanded to encompass other pertinent functions and methods in `xarray/core/dataset.py`. These focus on the Dataset object and its methods used for merging operations. The search task involves finding places in the codebase to implement the new functionality or alter existing logic to better manage Dataset variable mismatches. It necessitates deep comprehension of how to integrate this new feature flawlessly, considering the existing architecture for concat and merge operations in xarray. Yielding results from the queried paths thus reveal detailed hints about where the alterations may be introduced or further developed.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
