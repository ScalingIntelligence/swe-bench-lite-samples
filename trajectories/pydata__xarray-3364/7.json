Both of these functions have parameters for `data_vars` and `join`, which suggest places to implement or adjust functionality related to variable mismatches during concatenation.

Analyzing the provided search results, the focus should be on the `concat` function within `xarray/core/concat.py`. This function currently requires users to create dummy variables filled with `NaN` or drop mismatched variables, which is the problem the issue aims to address. Relevant portions of the code include the `concat` function itself and its helper functions. Additionally, looking at other related functions such as `merge` in `xarray/core/merge.py` and `Dataset` methods in `xarray/core/dataset.py` can provide context on how datasets are currently manipulated and merged in xarray. This understanding will inform how to modify `concat` to better handle mismatched variables. Looking further into `xarray/core/variable.py`, specifically at the `Variable` and `IndexVariable` classes, might also reveal how variables are concatenated, contributing to a more comprehensive solution. Finally, examining `xarray/core/dataset.py` to understand dataset construction and manipulation, particularly the `Dataset` class and its `reindex` and `merge` methods, will help in designing a solution that fits within xarray's existing framework. The task is complete as the relevant code spans have been identified and now need to be modified according to the issue's requirements.",

This aligns with the `pd.concat` behavior, which handles differently structured DataFrames more gracefully through an outer join. The current implementation of `xray.concat` forces users to manually handle missing variables with NaN or drop them, which is not ideal. To address this, it would be beneficial to introduce an option in `xray.concat` that automatically handles missing variables by default or through a specific parameter.\n\nThe current context provided several key functions and methods related to concatenation and merging within the xarray codebase. Specifically, the `xarray/core/concat.py` file contains the main `concat` function, and the `xarray/core/variable.py` file contains classes and methods for `Variable` and `IndexVariable` that include their own concatenation logic. There are also significant mentions of merging in the `xarray/core/merge.py` and `xarray/core/dataset.py` files.\n\nIn analyzing the new search results from `xarray/core/dataset.py` and `xarray/core/variable.py`, we observe further relevant methods and classes. Notably, the `Dataset` class in `xarray/core/dataset.py` contains methods for `reindex` and `merge`, which could potentially be extended or modified to support the desired behavior. Additionally, in `xarray/core/variable.py`, the `Variable.concat` method was already identified, but now there's also a standalone `concat` function that decides whether to use `IndexVariable.concat` or `Variable.concat` based on input type. This function could be a good entry point for modifying the concatenation behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans of code that are most relevant to the reported issue are primarily in `xarray/core/dataset.py` for `Dataset.reindex` and `Dataset.merge`, and in `xarray/core/variable.py` for the `concat` methods. These code spans are directly involved in the operations that need enhancement to address the issue of concatenating Datasets with differing variables.",
