The search results contain several relevant code spans that are directly related to the concat operation in xarray, particularly in the `xarray/core/concat.py` file. The `concat` function and the underlying `_dataset_concat` and `_dataarray_concat` functions are identified as highly relevant, as they handle the concatenation logic. Additionally, the `_calc_concat_dim_coord` function is relevant as it prepares the dimension for concatenation. In the `xarray/core/variable.py` file, the `Variable.concat` method and the `IndexVariable.concat` method are also relevant, as they manage the concatenation of variable objects. These code spans collectively provide the necessary functionality for handling dataset concatenation, suggesting that addressing the issue might involve refining these functions to better handle datasets with mismatched variables.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
