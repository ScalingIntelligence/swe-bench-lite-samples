The current implementation requires users to manually handle mismatched variables by either creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables entirely. The issue suggests that `xray.concat` should handle this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` which performs an outer join. The search results include relevant code spans that deal with the concatenation logic in `xarray/core/concat.py` and `xarray/core/variable.py`. Specifically, the `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` is responsible for handling the concatenation of datasets and data arrays, and it includes checks for compatibility and alignment of variables. The `_dataset_concat` and `_dataarray_concat` functions within `xarray/core/concat.py` are also relevant as they handle the concatenation of datasets and data arrays respectively. Additionally, the `Variable.concat` and `IndexVariable.concat` methods in `xarray/core/variable.py` are responsible for concatenating variables along a specified dimension. These methods could be modified to include an option that handles mismatched variables automatically, similar to pandas' outer join behavior.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
