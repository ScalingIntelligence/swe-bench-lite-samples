This aligns with the `xarray.concat` function which needs an enhancement to handle this seamlessly, similar to `pd.concat` which does an outer join. Upon analyzing the search results, the `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` and `xarray/core/variable.py` are relevant as they both handle the concatenation of Datasets and Variables. The `_dataset_concat` function deals specifically with Dataset concatenation, making it a central piece for addressing the issue due to its handling of data variables and coordinates during concatenation. The identified `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` can be updated to include a new parameter or option that handles missing variables by default or through a specific setting, which would resolve the issue effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the `Variable.concat` and `IndexVariable.concat` methods in `xarray/core/variable.py` support concatenation for Variable and IndexVariable objects respectively. These are also relevant because they handle the underlying data operations needed by `_dataset_concat`. Enhancement in these areas could allow for better handling of differing variables during concatenation operations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on enhancing the `xray.concat` function to handle datasets with different variables more gracefully, similar to `pd.concat` which performs an outer join. The current implementation of `xray.concat` requires creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables, which are awkward solutions. The ideal enhancement would be adding an option to `concat` to handle this automatically.\n\nExamination of the provided code reveals several relevant sections, particularly in `concat.py` and `variable.py`, where the `concat` function is defined and implemented. The current behavior of `concat` is to raise a `ValueError` if variables are present in some datasets but not others, which aligns with the problem statement that users want to avoid. This suggests that the function needs to be modified to handle such cases more gracefully.\n\nAdditionally, there are other functions like `merge` in `merge.py` and `combine_nested` in `combine.py` that might also require adjustments to support this enhanced functionality. These functions are typically used in conjunction with `concat` and might need updates to ensure compatibility and desired behavior when dealing with datasets containing different variables.\n\nGiven these observations, the identified relevant code spans focus on the `concat` function itself, its supporting functions, and other related functionalities likely involved in handling dataset concatenation with variable mismatches. The next step would be to propose changes to these identified sections to implement the desired functionality, and possibly extend this approach to handle similar scenarios in related functions like `merge` and `combine_by_coords`.",

However, the issue suggests that the default behavior should be more relaxed towards handling different variables, potentially aligning with the default 'outer' join behavior of `pd.concat`. This change would involve adjusting the default settings in the `concat` function or possibly changing the default value of the `join` parameter (if not already 'outer'). The presence of the `_dataset_concat` and `_dataarray_concat` functions in `xarray/core/concat.py` suggests that both datasets and data arrays are considered in the concatenation process, which aligns well with the reported issue.

The primary functions to focus on are `concat` within `concat.py` and `_dataset_concat` for detailed concatenation of datasets. These functions already support concatenation with options like `data_vars`, `coords`, and `join` parameters, which allow for some level of handling mismatched variables. Examining these functions in detail will provide insights into how mismatched variables are currently handled and how the concatenation process might be improved to better handle different variables, potentially mimicking the outer join behavior of `pd.concat`. Additionally, the `merge` function in `merge.py` and related methods in `combine.py` could play a role in how datasets with different variables are eventually combined.

These functions handle dataset concatenation, including situations where datasets have different variables, by using parameters like `data_vars`, `coords`, and `join`. The `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` is the main interface for concatenation, and it leads to `_dataset_concat`, which performs the detailed concatenation, including handling of mismatched variables. The `compat` parameter within `_dataset_concat` is used to specify how to handle mismatched variables, similar to the proposed functionality in the issue. The process also involves alignment and merging of datasets, indicating that the relevant code for implementing the desired behavior is present. Additionally, the `merge` function in `xarray/core/merge.py` and related methods in `xarray/core/combine.py` also play a part in combining datasets with different variables. Therefore, the provided file context is sufficient to understand the current state of handling mismatched variables during concatenation and to identify where improvements or modifications could be made to better handle different variables, potentially by enhancing or modifying the `concat` and `merge` functions.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
