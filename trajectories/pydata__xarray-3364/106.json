This aligns with the behavior of `pd.concat`, which performs an outer join. The search results reveal the current implementation of `concat` in `xarray`, particularly in `xarray/core/concat.py` and `xarray/core/variable.py`.\n\nIn `xarray/core/concat.py`, the main `concat` function handles the concatenation of `Dataset` and `DataArray` objects. The `_dataset_concat` function processes the concatenation of `Dataset` objects, which currently requires variables to be present in all datasets, thus necessitating the creation of dummy variables with `NaN` values or dropping mismatched variables. This is the focus of the issue, suggesting that this function might need an update to allow an outer join for variables similar to `pd.concat`.\n\nIn `xarray/core/variable.py`, the `Variable.concat` method shows the concatenation logic for `Variable` objects, where an outer join approach could also be implemented to address the issue seamlessly. This method might also require adjustments to support the desired behavior.\n\nOverall, these code spans are highly relevant to implementing the solution as they contain the core logic of `concat` operations, thereby providing a perfect starting point for addressing the reported issue.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
