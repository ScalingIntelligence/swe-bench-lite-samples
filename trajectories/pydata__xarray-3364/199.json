The current behavior requires manual intervention with dummy variables or dropping mismatched variables. The ideal solution would be for `concat` to automatically handle this, potentially through an outer join mechanism. Given the context and the provided code snippets, it's clear that the `concat` function and related functionalities are spread across multiple files within the `xarray` module. Focusing on the `concat` function and its associated methods in `xarray/core/concat.py`, `xarray/core/combine.py`, and others will likely yield relevant code for addressing this issue.",

This contrasts with `pd.concat`, which performs an outer join, naturally handling mismatched variables. The relevant code spans identified include the main `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py`, which orchestrates the concatenation process, and the `_dataset_concat` function, responsible for concatenating datasets, including handling of data variables and coordinates. Additionally, the `Variable.concat` and `IndexVariable.concat` methods in `xarray/core/variable.py` are relevant as they handle the concatenation of individual variables. These sections of code should enable the implementation of a more relaxed approach to handling mismatched variables during concatenation, aligning behavior more closely with `pd.concat`.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
