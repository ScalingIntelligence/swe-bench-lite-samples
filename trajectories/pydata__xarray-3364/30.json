            "scratch_pad": "The issue concerns the behavior of xarray's `concat` function when dealing with datasets that have different variables. Ideally, `concat` should handle these cases more gracefully, similar to how `pd.concat` would handle dataframes with mismatched columns by performing an outer join. To address this, we should focus on the `concat` function and related methods in the xarray library, particularly in modules like `concat.py`, `combine.py`, `dataset.py`, `merge.py`, `alignment.py`, and `variable.py`. The search should also consider the `join` parameter, which might be set to 'outer' to achieve the desired behavior.",

The current implementation requires users to manually handle mismatched variables by either creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables. The users propose that `concat` should handle this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` which performs an outer join by default. Reviewing the search results, there are several relevant code spans in `xarray/core/concat.py` that are related to the concatenation logic. Specifically, the `concat` function and its supporting functions like `_calc_concat_over`, `_parse_datasets`, and `_dataset_concat` are directly involved in the concatenation process and could be modified to address the issue. The `join='outer'` parameter in these functions indicates they already support outer joins, which aligns with the suggested behavior. Thus, these code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and should be considered for implementing the required changes. Additionally, the `merge` function in `xarray/core/merge.py` could also be relevant as it deals with combining datasets, which may have overlapping or mismatched variables.",

The current `xarray.concat` requires users to manually handle mismatched variables by either creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` or dropping mismatched variables. The goal is to make `concat` handle this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` which does an outer join by default.\n\nThe search results include relevant sections from `xarray/core/concat.py` and `xarray/core/merge.py` that are related to concatenation and merging of Datasets. The spans identified include the `concat` function, which is the main function for concatenation, and related internal functions like `_calc_concat_over` and `_dataset_concat`. These functions handle various aspects of concatenation, including aligning datasets, calculating variables to concatenate over, and merging variables. Additionally, the `merge_core` and `merge` functions from `merge.py` are relevant as they handle the merging of datasets, which is closely related to concatenation.\n\nThe identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the concatenation and merging logic in xarray, which should be sufficient to address the reported issue. These spans cover the necessary functionality to understand how datasets are currently concatenated and how the handling of mismatched variables can be improved.\n\nOverall, the identified spans in `concat.py` and `merge.py` provide a complete context to address the reported issue of handling missing variables during dataset concatenation.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
