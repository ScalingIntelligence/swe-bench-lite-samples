The current implementation requires users to either create dummy variables filled with `NaN` or drop mismatched variables, which is cumbersome. The search results show the main `concat` function in `xarray/core/concat.py` and its helper functions. The `concat` function decides whether to use `_dataarray_concat` or `_dataset_concat` based on the type of the first object. The `_dataset_concat` function is particularly relevant as it handles the concatenation of datasets, including aligning datasets and handling variable mismatches. Additionally, the `concat` function in `xarray/core/variable.py` is responsible for concatenating variables themselves, which is crucial for addressing the issue at hand. These functions represent the core logic for concatenation in xarray, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.",

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
