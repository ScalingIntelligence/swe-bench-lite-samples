This function is responsible for concatenating Dataset or DataArray objects. It aligns the objects based on the `dim` parameter and handles different data variables and coordinates. This is directly relevant to the issue as it is the core function to concatenate xarray objects.\n\n- In `xarray/core/variable.py`, there are definitions for `Variable` and `IndexVariable`, including their `concat` methods. These methods handle the concatenation of Variable objects, which is essential for understanding how individual variables are concatenated and how they might be extended to handle mismatched variables better.\n\nGiven these code spans, the relevant sections that align with the reported issue are those that deal with the `concat` functionality.

The provided file context includes the `_dataset_concat` function which handles alignment and concatenation of datasets based on the specified 'join' parameter. It is evident from the code that when 'join' is set to 'outer', the function attempts to align datasets by including all dimensions and variables, filling in missing data with `NaN` values, which is in line with the behavior described in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code to handle mismatched variables during concatenation using an outer join is already present in the given context. Moreover, the function `concat` in `concat.py` determines whether to use `_dataarray_concat` or `_dataset_concat` based on the type of the first object in the input, giving further evidence of where the functionality to address the issue lies.

Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n"
