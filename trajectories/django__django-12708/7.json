This issue occurs specifically in Django 1.11.10 and can be reproduced by creating models with specific fields, adding them to both unique_together and index_together, and then attempting to delete the index_together. The error occurs at line 378 in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' within the '_delete_composed_index' method, where a ValueError is raised due to finding the wrong number of constraints. To address this, it is necessary to examine the code related to the handling of these constraints. The provided search results include relevant code spans from 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', including the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class and its methods, specifically '_delete_composed_index'. Additionally, there are related operations for handling unique_together and index_together from 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. These sections seem relevant as they directly deal with the constraints in question and therefore should be considered for further analysis and potential modification or enhancement to resolve the reported issue.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
