The main problem occurs when attempting to delete an 'index_together' while a 'unique_together' exists on the same fields, leading to a failure in migrations. The error specifically points to the '_delete_composed_index' method in the schema editor. To address this, the search should focus on the methods involved in altering or deleting these constraints. Specifically, we should look into the '_delete_composed_index' method across different database backends (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and the relevant migration operations that handle 'unique_together' and 'index_together' constraints.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
