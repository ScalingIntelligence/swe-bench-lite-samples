The error occurs in the `_delete_composed_index` method of the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class, where it finds two constraints (the _uniq and the _idx one) instead of one. This needs to be investigated in the context of schema migrations and related operations. Focus should be on the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` and its subclasses, as well as the migration operations that handle unique and index constraints.",

The search results reveal key methods in the Django schema editor that handle the creation and deletion of these constraints. The methods 'alter_unique_together' and 'alter_index_together' in 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class are particularly relevant as they manage changes to these constraints. The method '_delete_composed_index' is also crucial as it is invoked during the deletion process and is where the reported failure occurs. The code spans related to these methods should be identified as relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the MySQL and PostgreSQL schema editors modify the '_delete_composed_index' behavior, highlighting the variability across different database backends. These variances are relevant to consider when addressing the issue, as the fix might need to be tailored to different database behaviors. Overall, the identified code spans align with the operations that could lead to the described failure when managing constraints in Django models.",
