The key problem is that when trying to delete an index_together, the system encounters two constraints (one for unique_together and one for index_together) and raises a ValueError. This issue is related to the Django database schema editor, specifically the _delete_composed_index method. The search results include relevant files such as `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py`, and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
