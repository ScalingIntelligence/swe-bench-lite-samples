The issue describes a crash that occurs when attempting to delete the 'index_together' due to the code expecting only one constraint but finding two. The search results provided include relevant sections from Django's schema and migration files, particularly focusing on the '_delete_composed_index' method in 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' and its override in 'DatabaseSchemaEditor'. This method is central to the problem, as it is where the ValueError is raised due to finding the wrong number of constraints. Additionally, the migration operations related to 'AlterUniqueTogether' and 'AlterIndexTogether' are included, which are crucial for understanding how these constraints are managed in migrations. Based on the reported issue, these sections of code are directly related to the problem described and would likely be the focus for any bug fix or enhancement.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
