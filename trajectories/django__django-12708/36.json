This results in a ValueError due to finding the wrong number of constraints. The issue seems to be specific to Django 1.11.10 and the problematic code is identified in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, line 378, in `_delete_composed_index()`. The focus of the analysis should be on this function and related methods that handle the management of these constraints.\n\nAfter examining the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are located within `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` and its derived classes, especially focusing on methods handling unique and index constraints such as `alter_unique_together`, `alter_index_together`, and `_delete_composed_index`. These methods directly deal with altering and deleting constraints on the database schema, which aligns with the core of the reported issue.\n\nKey elements mentioned in the issue guide the search, such as 'unique_together' and 'index_together', and the error message about finding the wrong number of constraints. This directs attention to specific SQL operations for creating, altering, and deleting these constraints, which are found in the code spans provided.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans have been successfully identified, covering the essential components related to the issue description. This includes where unique and index constraints are managed, altered, and deleted in the database schema editor.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
