            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a crash during the migration process when deleting an 'index_together' constraint if there is also a 'unique_together' constraint on the same fields. This issue is specific to Django 1.11.10 and can occur when attempting to refactor the code to use the 'new' Options.indexes feature. The steps to reproduce are straightforward, involving the creation of models with specific constraints that lead to the error in the `_delete_composed_index` method. The error message given states that 'ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for' occurs if two constraints (one unique and one index) are found for the same fields, which indicates the logic for constraint distinction is imperfect. \n\nAnalyzing the code provided, several key sections appear relevant: \n\n1. `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index`: This method is directly implicated in the error as it is where the incorrect number of constraints is identified. This method attempts to delete a composed index and handles both unique and index constraints, but fails if both types of constraints exist for the same fields. This suggests a flaw in the logic for identifying constraints, perhaps due to not distinguishing the unique and index constraints clearly enough. \n\n2. `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_unique_together` and `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_index_together`: These methods deal specifically with altering the unique_together and index_together meta options of models. They call `_delete_composed_index`, pointing to them as potential avenues for error handling or further debugging directly related to the issue. \n\n3. The `RemoveConstraint` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` suggests how constraints are typically removed via migrations. Since the issue arises during a migration, understanding how Django handles constraint removal in migration operations may provide insight into why the error occurs during this process. \n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue and the methods directly involved in managing constraints and migrating data, the identified spans of code seem to cover the scope of the problem accurately. However, it's worth noting that the specific database backend (MySQL in this case) might have custom handling for constraint deletions (`DatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index`), offering contextual clues on differences in constraint management between database backends that could be pertinent to the development of a fix or workaround.",

Specifically, the `_delete_composed_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` seems to be the point of failure as described in the issue. Additionally, the `alter_unique_together` and `alter_index_together` methods in the same file handle changes to unique and index constraints, respectively, which is highly relevant to the issue. Moreover, the `RemoveConstraint` operation in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` also supports the removal of constraints, which may be related to the issue during migrations. Lastly, the model class checks in `django/db/models/base.py` for `index_together` and `unique_together` configurations are also pertinent. Despite not having access to all parts of the codebase, the provided file context seems sufficient to understand the logic involved in managing these constraints and indexes. Therefore, I believe the relevant code has been identified to address the issue.",
