The error occurs specifically within the `_delete_composed_index` method in the schema editor, indicating that the method is expected to handle the removal of these constraints correctly. To address this, we need to focus on the schema editor classes across different database backends and the migration operations that handle these constraints. The primary focus will be on the `alter_unique_together` and `alter_index_together` methods, as well as the `_delete_composed_index` method, to ensure that these operations correctly manage the constraints without causing conflicts. Additionally, it's relevant to check the `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` classes in the migration operations to see how they handle these constraints during backwards migrations.",

The search results include relevant code spans within 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' related to 'unique_together' and 'index_together' handling, focusing on how indexes and constraints are managed and altered. Additionally, there are specific implementations in 'DatabaseSchemaEditor' for MySQL and migration operations in 'models.py' that handle alterations to these constraints.

Additionally, the _delete_composed_index method, which is central to the issue described, is also available in the context. This method should handle the deletion of composite indexes and unique constraints, potentially the source of the reported error due to incorrect handling of multiple constraints. Conversely, within the DatabaseSchemaEditor class in django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py, the _delete_composed_index method is overridden, though its relevance and potential modifications specific to MySQL are not entirely clear without additional context of usage or further specifics of what might be needed for the MySQL backend. The migration operations classes in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py show the AlterUniqueTogether and AlterIndexTogether operations, which implies that these operations are designed to manage changes to the unique_together and index_together settings. Overall, the provided file context appears to include all the relevant code that interfaces directly with the unique_together and index_together settings, and suggests that this portion of the codebase is responsible for handling the operations and migrations related to these constraints.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
