Identified key points: deletion of index_together should be handled coherently with unique_together, and moving index declaration should not result in re-creation.\n2. Reviewed the current file context which indicated no relevant code has been identified yet.\n3. Processed new search results: found relevant code spans in django/db/backends/base/schema.py, django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py, and django/db/migrations/operations/models.py. Specifically identified methods like _delete_composed_index, alter_unique_together, and alter_index_together which directly relate to handling unique_together and index_together constraints during migrations.\n4. Evaluated the relevance of each code span based on alignment with the reported issue. Determined that the identified methods are crucial for managing the constraints in question and thus are highly relevant.\n5. Decided to include these identified spans in the response as they are directly related to the issue at hand and provide context necessary for addressing the reported problem.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
