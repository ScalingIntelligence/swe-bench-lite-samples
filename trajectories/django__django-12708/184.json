This suggests that the problem lies in how composed indexes are handled when deleting, especially when there's a unique_together on the same fields. Additionally, the operations `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` are directly involved in managing the unique and index constraints related to the issue.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
