The issue occurs specifically in the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class within django/db/backends/base/schema.py. This class handles database schema manipulations during migrations. The specific method causing the problem is _delete_composed_index(), which tries to delete a constraint and fails if it finds multiple constraints (both unique and index) on the same fields, leading to a ValueError. Additionally, there are methods such as alter_unique_together() and alter_index_together() that manage changes to unique_together and index_together constraints, respectively. In the migration operations, there are classes like AlterUniqueTogether and AlterIndexTogether that handle changes to these constraints. The task is to identify the necessary code spans that will help address this issue by possibly modifying the _delete_composed_index() method or adjusting how constraints are handled when making changes to unique_together and index_together in migrations.",

These methods handle the creation, alteration, and deletion of unique and index constraints, which are directly related to the reported issue concerning the migration crash when deleting an `index_together` that shares fields with a `unique_together`. Additionally, the migration operations like `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` are present in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, which further confirms that the necessary operations to handle these constraints are accounted for in the provided context.
