The error points to the method _delete_composed_index in Django's schema editor, specifically in the base and MySQL schema files. To resolve this, we need to focus on the handling of constraints like 'index_together' and 'unique_together' in the schema editor classes and migration operations. Additionally, the Model classes and their constraint checks should also be reviewed for any inconsistencies or oversights in handling these constraints during migrations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves migration crashes when deleting an 'index_together' if there is also a 'unique_together' on the same fields. This issue occurs specifically in Django 1.11.10. The steps to reproduce involve creating models with two fields, adding these fields to both 'unique_together' and 'index_together', and then deleting the 'index_together', which results in a crash. The error is traced to the '_delete_composed_index()' method in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', specifically at line 378, where a ValueError is raised due to finding the wrong number of constraints. The primary focus should be on identifying code spans related to handling 'unique_together' and 'index_together', and the '_delete_composed_index()' method as it is central to the issue. Additionally, considering the move to the 'Options.indexes' feature in Django 1.11, it's relevant to look for code handling index creation and deletion. From the provided search results, 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' contains methods like 'alter_unique_together', 'alter_index_together', and '_delete_composed_index' which are directly relevant to the issue. These methods appear to manage the addition and deletion of constraints and indexes, which are key to understanding and resolving the reported problem. Furthermore, methods like '_delete_index_sql' and '_create_index_sql' are also critical as they handle the SQL operations for deleting and creating indexes, respectively. In the context of the MySQL backend ('django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py'), there is a specialized implementation of the '_delete_composed_index' method that could also be relevant, especially if the issue varies or manifests differently across different database backends. The model operations in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' that handle 'AlterTogetherOptionOperation' are also relevant, as they manage how these operations are processed during migrations. Lastly, model checks for 'index_together' and 'unique_together' in 'django/db/models/base.py' provide further context on how these options are validated and managed within the model definition.",
