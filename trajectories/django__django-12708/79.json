The error specifically points to '_delete_composed_index' method in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' where it fails due to finding two constraints instead of one. To resolve this, we need to look into how 'unique_together' and 'index_together' are handled in the schema editor and migration operations. Specifically, we should focus on the '_delete_composed_index' method in the base schema editor and its implementations in the specific database backends (MySQL, PostgreSQL). Additionally, we should examine the operations related to altering 'unique_together' and 'index_together' in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. Finally, since the issue involves constraints, we should also look at the 'UniqueConstraint' class in 'django/db/models/constraints.py'.",

The primary problem lies in the `_delete_composed_index` method, which does not correctly account for the presence of both constraints (unique and index) and their names. The method is designed to find one constraint by name, but if both unique and index constraints exist with the same fields, it finds two constraints and raises a ValueError. The initial fix will focus on distinguishing between unique and index constraints when deleting them.",
