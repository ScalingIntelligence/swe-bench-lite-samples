This problem occurs specifically with Django 1.11.10. The error points to the '_delete_composed_index()' method in the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class, which seems to be the central point of the issue. To address this, we need to narrow down the search to the relevant methods and classes handling these constraints and their alterations during migrations. We'll focus on the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor', 'AlterTogetherOptionOperation', 'MigrationAutodetector', and 'Model' classes as they are directly involved in handling these constraints and migrations.",

This problem occurs specifically in Django 1.11.10. The key elements to identify are the methods and functionalities related to 'unique_together' and 'index_together' in the schema editor and migration operations. Upon reviewing the provided code spans, several relevant sections are found in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py'. These include the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class, particularly the methods 'alter_unique_together', 'alter_index_together', '_delete_composed_index', '_create_unique_sql', and '_delete_unique_sql'. Each of these methods deals directly with the manipulation of unique and index constraints, which are central to the reported issue. The second file, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', contains the 'AlterUniqueTogether' and 'AlterIndexTogether' classes, which are also relevant as they define the operations for changing these constraints during migrations. Based on the alignment of these code spans with the reported issue, it is concluded that they are highly relevant and provide a comprehensive view of the problem's scope within the Django codebase.
