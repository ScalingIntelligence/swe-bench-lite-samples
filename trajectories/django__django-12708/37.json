The provided search results include relevant sections of the Django codebase, particularly in the 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' file, which contains methods for altering these constraints and deleting composed indexes. Additionally, the 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' file includes methods for generating alterations for these constraints, suggesting that this file might also be involved in the migration process. The specific sections of interest are 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_unique_together', 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_index_together', and the private method '_delete_composed_index'. The '_delete_composed_index' method appears to be where the issue's specific error is thrown, indicating that this method is crucial for addressing the problem.

The `_delete_composed_index` method is particularly relevant as it deals with the deletion of constraints, which is where the reported ValueError occurs. Additionally, the `MigrationAutodetector` in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` is also relevant as it generates migrations that could potentially alter these constraints.
