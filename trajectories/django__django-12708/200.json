This leads to a ValueError in the Django schema editor. This issue is relevant to Django 1.11.10. The search results provide several key sections of code that are directly related to handling constraints and indexes in Django's database schema editor and model definitions.\n\n1. In `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`:\n- The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index` method is directly involved in deleting composed indexes, which could be where the error is occurring. This method checks the constraints and raises a ValueError if the number of constraints found is not exactly one, which matches the issue description.\n\n2. In `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`:\n- The `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` class and its methods are relevant for operations that alter together options like 'index_together' and 'unique_together'. The methods `__init__`, `database_backwards`, `references_field`, and `describe` provide functionalities for altering these options during migrations.\n\n3. In `django/db/models/base.py`:\n- The `Model._check_index_together` and `Model._check_unique_together` class methods are used for checking the validity of 'index_together' and 'unique_together' options in model definitions. These checks ensure that the options are correctly specified and do not conflict.\n\nThese sections of code are directly related to managing and altering 'index_together' and 'unique_together' constraints, which are central to the reported issue.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
