This is particularly problematic when trying to refactor code to use Django's new 'Options.indexes' feature. The error occurs in the '_delete_composed_index' method, suggesting that this function needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially modified to handle the presence of both constraints correctly. Additionally, it's important to ensure that migrations and model operations involving 'index_together' and 'unique_together' are properly synchronized. Given the context, it's essential to focus searches on the specific methods and files associated with handling these constraints and their alterations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a crash when deleting an `index_together` if there is a `unique_together` on the same fields. This occurs specifically in Django 1.11.10. The main area of concern is in the `_delete_composed_index` method within the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class, where a `ValueError` is raised if there are multiple constraints found for the same fields. The provided search results reveal several key sections of code related to handling `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints, including the `alter_unique_together`, `alter_index_together`, and `_delete_composed_index` methods. These methods are crucial for understanding how these constraints are managed and potentially modified during migrations.\n\nRelevant files include `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py`, and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class and its subclasses contain methods that directly influence how unique and index constraints are altered or deleted. Specifically, the `_delete_composed_index` method's logic should be carefully examined to ensure it correctly handles cases where both `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints exist on the same fields.\n\nIn addition, the `Index` class in `django/db/models/indexes.py` is also relevant as it defines how indexes are created and managed, which is directly tied to the `index_together` functionality. This class contains methods for creating and removing indexes, which could be involved in the reported issue if there's a conflict or incorrect handling between unique and index constraints.",
