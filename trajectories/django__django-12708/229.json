The error occurs specifically in Django 1.11.10, and the core problem seems to be related to the `_delete_composed_index` method in the schema editor. This method fails because it finds two constraints (one for unique_together and one for index_together), and there's no clear way to distinguish between them. To resolve this, it's necessary to examine how these constraints are managed and altered during migrations, focusing on the schema editor and migration operations that handle unique and index together constraints.",

  "initial_message": "Migration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields\nDescription\n\t\nHappens with Django 1.11.10\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together\n2) Delete index_together -> Fail\nIt will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
