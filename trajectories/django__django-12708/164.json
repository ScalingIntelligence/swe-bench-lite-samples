Django's schema editor code handles the creation and removal of unique and index constraints, and the related migration operations. After analyzing the code, I identified several key spans that are directly related to managing 'unique_together' and 'index_together' constraints, and the handling of their deletions. Specifically, the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class contains methods for altering unique and index constraints ('alter_unique_together', 'alter_index_together'), and a critical method '_delete_composed_index' that is used to delete these constraints when they are no longer needed. The MySQL-specific schema editor ('DatabaseSchemaEditor') overrides some of these methods but does not change the core logic of handling these constraints. Additionally, I found relevant code in models and migrations operations that deal specifically with these together options, further confirming my selection. Following these findings, the specific spans I've identified are involved in the logic of creating, altering, and deleting unique and index together constraints, which directly address the reported issue.",
