This issue seems to be specific to Django version 1.11.10. The problem lies in the function `_delete_composed_index` in the `schema.py` file, which fails due to the constraint conflict. To accurately address this, it's important to focus on the logic that handles the deletion of composed indexes and their interaction with unique constraints. Searching for the implementation of `_delete_composed_index` across different database backends and related migration operations should help pinpoint where the core issue lies.",

Analyzing the reported issue, it seems that the core problem lies in the migration process when trying to delete an `index_together` constraint where there is also a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields. This is causing a ValueError when the code attempts to delete the index. \n2. Reviewing the current file context shows no relevant code identified yet, meaning this is the first pass at identifying relevant code spans. \n3. Processing the new search results, we find code spans that are highly relevant to the issue at hand:\n   a. The `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py` contains methods related to database schema editing, particularly `_delete_composed_index` which directly relates to the reported issue. This method is trying to handle the deletion of an index, which is exactly where the error is occurring. Identifying this method is crucial as it can potentially contain the root cause or solution to the reported issue.\n   b. The `models.py` file in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` contains multiple operations related to model handling during migrations, including `AlterUniqueTogether`, `AlterIndexTogether`, and `CreateModel`. These operations are closely related to the `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints involved in the reported issue. Understanding how these operations work during a migration is essential for addressing the problem.\n4. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those dealing directly with the management of `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints during migrations, as well as the specific method `_delete_composed_index` which is implicated in the error.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
