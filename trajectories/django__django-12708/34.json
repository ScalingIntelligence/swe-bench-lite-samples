The problem arises when attempting to delete an 'index_together' that shares fields with a 'unique_together', leading to a crash due to identifying multiple constraints. To address this, it's essential to examine the logic handling the deletion of such constraints, particularly in methods responsible for index and unique constraint management across different database backends. Additionally, reviewing the migration operations and model checking mechanisms will help in understanding how these constraints are initialized and altered during the migration process.",

In 'django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py', the 'DatabaseSchemaEditor' class and particularly the '_delete_composed_index' method where the error occurs.\n2.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
