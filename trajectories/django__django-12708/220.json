The error occurs when deleting an index_together from a model where the same fields are also specified in a unique_together constraint. This can lead to a ValueError due to the inability to differentiate between the unique and index constraints for deletion. To resolve this, we need to identify where in Django's codebase the handling of these constraints is managed and ensure that deletion of index_together is compatible with the presence of a unique_together constraint on the same fields. Additionally, the issue suggests that migrating the definition of an index should not automatically result in the re-creation of that index, which also needs to be addressed.",

            "scratch_pad": "1. Analyzing User Instructions: The reported issue is about a migration crash when deleting 'index_together' if there is a 'unique_together' on the same fields. The issue occurs specifically in Django 1.11.10 and involves errors in the `_delete_composed_index` method at `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, line 378. There is a suggestion for improvements related to deletion of 'index_together' and moving index declarations without re-creation.\n\n2. Review Current Context: No relevant code has been identified yet.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n  3.1. Analyzing `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` and related methods in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`: These code spans deal directly with database schema changes, including adding and altering unique and index constraints.\n  3.2. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index` method seems particularly relevant as it handles the deletion of composed indexes and raises a ValueError if the number of constraints is incorrect, which aligns with the reported issue.\n  3.3. `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` classes in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` are relevant for managing model options related to 'unique_together' and 'index_together' respectively.\n  3.4. The `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` handles the auto-detection of changes needed in database migrations, particularly the methods `generate_altered_unique_together` and `generate_altered_index_together` which directly address the issue of altering these constraints.\n  3.5. Given the nature of the issue (related to schema migration and constraint handling), reviewing entire sections of code from `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` through to `MigrationAutodetector` ensures a comprehensive understanding of how 'unique_together' and 'index_together' are managed and potentially how an issue might arise.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans have been identified in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, and `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`.",

Further investigation is needed to understand how this method actually handles the distinction between unique and index constraints. Additionally, the migration operations related to these constraints, such as `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether`, are defined in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py. The `MigrationAutodetector` class in django/db/migrations/autodetector.py is responsible for detecting changes in these constraints during the migration process. These components work together to manage the lifecycle of unique and index constraints in Django models and migrations, ensuring that changes are correctly applied and conflicts are minimized.

The error occurs in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at line 378, in the `_delete_composed_index()` method, where it finds two constraints for the same fields, one from `unique_together` and one from `index_together`. To address this, one needs to look into how these constraints are managed and deleted in Django's migration framework. The focus should be on the `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` classes and their related methods in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, as well as the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class and its methods like `_delete_composed_index` in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. Additionally, the `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` plays a role in detecting changes in these constraints during migrations. The provided code spans for `AlterUniqueTogether`, `AlterIndexTogether`, and `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index` are directly relevant to the reported issue as they deal with the management and deletion of these constraints.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
