The error specifically occurs at `_delete_composed_index()` in `schema.py`, which finds multiple constraints and raises a `ValueError`. To address this issue, we need to focus on the related methods in `schema.py`, `models.py`, and `migrations` modules, including `_delete_composed_index`, `AlterUniqueTogether`, `AlterIndexTogether`, and `RemoveConstraint`.",

This issue is specifically mentioned to occur at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(). After analyzing the search results, I have identified several relevant code spans that pertain to the issue:\n\n1. In django/db/backends/base/schema.py, the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class contains methods 'alter_unique_together' and 'alter_index_together' which manage changes to these constraints. Importantly, these methods both call '_delete_composed_index', which is the function mentioned in the issue description as causing the problem.\n\n2. The '_delete_composed_index' method in the 'DatabaseSchemaEditor' class of django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py also seems relevant, as it handles the deletion of composed indexes specifically for MySQL.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans directly relate to the functionality affected by the reported issue, making the search results relevant and potentially fixing the problem. Further investigation should be done to analyze these methods and their interactions in more detail.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
