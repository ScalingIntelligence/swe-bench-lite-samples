            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to a scenario where a migration crashes when attempting to delete an 'index_together' when there is also a 'unique_together' on the same fields. The user points out that this occurs in Django 1.11.10 and provides steps to reproduce the issue. They also mention the specific line in the 'schema.py' where the crash happens. Based on this, the first key element to look for is anything related to handling 'index_together' and 'unique_together' constraints, especially their removal or alteration, in the provided search results. Additionally, looking for any code that might handle the migration of these constraints or the specific error mentioned ('ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints') is crucial.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, I found relevant code spans in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. In 'schema.py', the '_delete_composed_index' method seems to be where the error occurs (as indicated by the user). This method handles the deletion of composite indexes and raises a 'ValueError' when there's an unexpected number of constraints. The method '_constraint_names' is also relevant as it searches for constraint names.\n\nIn 'models.py', the 'AlterUniqueTogether' and 'AlterIndexTogether' classes are significant as they handle alterations to the 'unique_together' and 'index_together' options, respectively. Understanding how these operations are managed, particularly in relation to migrations, is essential. The '__init__' methods for both 'AlterUniqueTogether' and 'AlterIndexTogether' also indicate how these operations are initialized with the 'unique_together' and 'index_together' options, respectively.\n\nThese code spans collectively address the reported issue by targeting the specific operations and errors related to 'index_together' and 'unique_together' in Django migrations.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
