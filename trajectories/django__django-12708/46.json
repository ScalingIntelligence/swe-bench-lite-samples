This conflict leads to a crash during migrations. The search results contain relevant code spans that address this issue directly.\n\n1. **django/db/backends/base/schema.py**: This file contains the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class, which has methods for altering unique_together and index_together constraints. Specifically, these methods (`alter_unique_together` and `alter_index_together`) handle the removal of constraints. The `_delete_composed_index` method within this class is relevant because it raises a `ValueError` when the wrong number of constraints is found.\n\n2. **django/db/migrations/operations/models.py**: This file contains operations related to model migrations, specifically for altering unique_together and index_together. The `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` classes are relevant for understanding how these constraints are modified during migrations.\n\n3. **django/db/migrations/autodetector.py**: This file contains the `MigrationAutodetector` class, which generates migrations based on changes in the models. The methods `generate_altered_unique_together` and `generate_altered_index_together` are relevant for understanding how migration operations are detected and created to alter these constraints.\n\nThese code spans provide a comprehensive view of how unique_together and index_together constraints are managed and altered in Django, directly addressing the reported issue. Additionally, they offer insights into how migrations are generated and processed, ensuring a thorough understanding of the issue at hand.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the search results do not contain an exact match for the line mentioned in the issue (line 378 in django/db/backends/base/schema.py).

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
