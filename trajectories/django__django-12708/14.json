The problem occurs because the method _delete_composed_index() incorrectly identifies the number of constraints, causing a ValueError. The search results provide relevant code spans in two files: django/db/backends/base/schema.py and django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py. Both files contain the implementation of the _delete_composed_index method, which is critical for handling the deletion of composed indexes. The BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class in base/schema.py constructs the SQL queries for schema edits, including those related to constraints and indexes. The DatabaseSchemaEditor class in mysql/schema.py extends this functionality specifically for MySQL databases. Given the issue's description and the provided code spans, it's clear that the _delete_composed_index methods in both files are directly related to the reported issue. Identifying these spans helps in understanding the exact location of the code that needs to be fixed or improved to handle the deletion of index_together properly when unique_together is present.",
