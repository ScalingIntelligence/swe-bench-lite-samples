The issue occurs specifically in Django 1.11.10 and involves the `_delete_composed_index` method in the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class. This method is responsible for deleting composed indexes and unique constraints. The problem arises because the method finds two constraints (the unique constraint and the index constraint) and raises a `ValueError`. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the manipulation of these constraints and indexes. The search results include several relevant spans in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` and `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, which are likely to be central to resolving the issue. These spans include the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class, particularly the methods for altering unique and index together (`alter_unique_together` and `alter_index_together`), as well as the `_delete_composed_index` method itself. Additionally, the `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` is relevant for understanding how migrations handle these constraints. The analysis of these spans suggests that the issue lies in the handling of multiple constraints on the same fields, specifically in the `_delete_composed_index` method, where the method fails to differentiate between unique and index constraints when deleting them. This information provides a clear path to address the reported issue.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
