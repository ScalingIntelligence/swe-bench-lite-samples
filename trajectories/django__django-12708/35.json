The error occurs due to the inability to differentiate between the two constraints, leading to a ValueError. The main focus should be on the schema editor and migration operations that handle altering unique_together and index_together, particularly where these constraints are managed and deleted. Additionally, it's important to check where these constraints are defined and how they interact in the context of model modifications and database migrations.",

The error occurs in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` at the `_delete_composed_index` method, specifically at line 378. The task is to identify relevant code spans that deal with the handling of `index_together` and `unique_together`, especially those that might be causing the crash due to constraints on the same fields. From the search results, several key spans stand out: 1. The `alter_unique_together` method in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class from `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. 2. The `alter_index_together` method in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class from `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. 3. The `_delete_composed_index` method in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class from `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, which is where the error is mentioned to occur. These methods handle the logic for altering these constraints and could be directly related to the reported issue. Additionally, other parts of Django handling constraints and indexes, such as the `_delete_unique_sql` and `_delete_index_sql` methods, could also be relevant.",
