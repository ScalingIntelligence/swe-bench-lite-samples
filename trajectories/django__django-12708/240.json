The issue points to a specific failure in the `_delete_composed_index` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, line 378. The relevant part of the issue also mentions refactoring code to use the 'new' Options.indexes feature in Django 1.11, which suggests an interest in the migration operations and schema editor functionalities related to unique and index constraints.\n\nReviewing the search results, the identified code spans are:\n1. `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_unique_together` and `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_index_together` in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` - These methods handle changes to the unique_together and index_together constraints, respectively. They interact directly with the database schema and are likely where the problem lies.\n2. `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index` in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` - This method is directly mentioned in the issue as causing the failure. It attempts to delete a composed index and fails if it finds the wrong number of constraints.\n3. `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` - These are migration operations specifically for altering the unique_together and index_together constraints. They are part of the migration framework and interact with the schema editor.\n4. `Model._check_index_together` and `Model._check_unique_together` in `django/db/models/base.py` - These class methods check the validity of the index_together and unique_together options in a model's metadata. While they are not directly related to the migration issue, understanding how these constraints are validated is useful context.\n\nGiven the issue description and the identified code spans, these files and code spans are directly relevant to resolving or understanding the reported issue concerning the operations on unique_together and index_together constraints in the context of Django migrations.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
