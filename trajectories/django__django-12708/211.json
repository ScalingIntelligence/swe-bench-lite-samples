The error occurs specifically in the `_delete_composed_index` method of the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class within the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file. The method raises a `ValueError` when it finds two constraints instead of one, specifically the `_uniq` and `_idx` constraints. This issue affects the coherence between `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints during migrations, and also impacts the refactoring of code to use the newer `Options.indexes` feature in Django 1.11. To address this issue, relevant code spans include the method `_delete_composed_index` in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, as well as related classes and methods in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and `django/db/models/constraints.py` that handle `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
