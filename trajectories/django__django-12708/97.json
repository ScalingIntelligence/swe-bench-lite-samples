The key function to focus on from the search results is '_delete_composed_index' in the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class within 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py'. This function is directly responsible for deleting composed indexes and is where the ValueError occurs due to encountering the wrong number of constraints. The specific concern is how the function iterates over constraints and indexes without differentiating correctly between unique_together and index_together constraints on the same fields, leading to the error. By identifying this function and its behavior, we can pinpoint the exact location in the codebase where a fix is needed to ensure that the deletion of index_together constraints is handled properly when unique_together constraints are also present on the same fields.",
