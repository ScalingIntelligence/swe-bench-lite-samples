Specifically, the error occurs in the `_delete_composed_index` method within `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class at line 378 of `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. This method is responsible for deleting composed indexes, but it fails when there are both `index_together` and `unique_together` constraints on the same fields, as it detects two constraints instead of one. To address this, further investigation is needed into how `alter_unique_together` and `alter_index_together` methods manage these constraints and how they interact with `_delete_composed_index`. Additionally, the implementation of `_delete_composed_index` in subclasses such as `DatabaseSchemaEditor` for MySQL and PostgreSQL should be reviewed to ensure consistency and correct handling of these constraints.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
