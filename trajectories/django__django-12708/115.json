The error occurs when trying to delete an index_together constraint that shares fields with a unique_together constraint. This leads to a ValueError in the _delete_composed_index method which is defined in django/db/backends/base/schema.py. To address this issue, we should focus on the schema and migration operations related to indexes, unique constraints, and index_together/unique_together handling. We should also check how migrations are automatically detected and how models are checked for these constraints.",

The issue specifically mentions `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` and line 378 in `_delete_composed_index()`, which suggests that this method is critical. Additionally, the issue refers to the interaction between `index_together` and `unique_together`, so I also need to look at the operations that alter these constraints in the migration operations.\n\nIn the provided search results, several key spans stand out as relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` contains the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class which has relevant SQL statements for creating and deleting constraints, including `sql_unique_constraint` and `sql_delete_constraint`. The `_delete_composed_index` method within this class is particularly relevant as it throws a `ValueError` mentioned in the issue when it finds the wrong number of constraints.\n\n2. `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py` extends `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` and its `_delete_composed_index` method may have MySQL-specific implementations for handling composed indexes.\n\n3. `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` includes operations for altering `unique_together` and `index_together`. The `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` classes are directly related to the issue.\n\n4. `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` contains `MigrationAutodetector`, which generates altered `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints, relevant for the automatic detection of changes during migrations.\n\n5. `django/db/models/base.py` includes methods that explicitly check the validity of `index_together` and `unique_together` settings. The `_check_index_together` and `_check_unique_together` methods in the `Model` class ensure that these constraints are correctly configured.\n\nThese spans provide a comprehensive view of how the Django ORM and migration system handle `index_together` and `unique_together` constraints, which is essential for understanding and addressing the issue. The identified spans cover constraint creation, deletion, and validation, as well as the migration operations related to these constraints.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
