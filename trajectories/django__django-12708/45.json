            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the crash during migration when attempting to delete an `index_together` in Django, where there is also a `unique_together` constraint on the same fields. This issue is particularly relevant in Django 1.11.10. The search results include key files and functions that are likely involved in handling these constraints and indexes during migrations. The `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` contains methods that handle SQL operations related to tables and constraints, including `_delete_composed_index`, which is directly linked to the issue as it throws a `ValueError` when it finds the wrong number of constraints during the deletion process. This class also includes SQL templates for creating and deleting constraints, which are crucial for addressing the issue of handling `unique_together` and `index_together` separately or coherently. The subclass `DatabaseSchemaEditor` in `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py` also overrides the `_delete_composed_index` method, suggesting that this method could be where the issue is occurring, especially considering how different database backends handle schema changes. In `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, the `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` classes are defined to handle changes to these options. This indicates that the management of these constraints at the migration operation level might also be relevant to the issue, particularly in understanding how these operations interact when one is being removed. Collectively, these code spans are highly relevant to the problem, as they directly touch upon the mechanics of how Django handles schema changes involving both `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
