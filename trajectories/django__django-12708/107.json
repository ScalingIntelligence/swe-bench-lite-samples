Analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class definition in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, specifically the methods `_delete_composed_index`, `alter_unique_together`, and `alter_index_together`. These methods handle the creation and deletion of unique and index constraints. Additionally, the `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py` overrides the `_delete_composed_index` method, which is also relevant. Finally, the `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` classes in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` are relevant as they represent operations that alter these constraints in migrations.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
