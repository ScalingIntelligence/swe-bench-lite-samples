The error occurs when trying to delete an index_together if there is also a unique_together on the same fields. The main concern is that the current implementation of _delete_composed_index in the schema editor does not correctly handle the case where both unique_together and index_together constraints are present on the same fields. This results in a ValueError when the code attempts to remove the index_together. To address this issue, it is necessary to investigate the code in the schema editor responsible for handling these constraints, as well as the migration operations related to altering unique_together and index_together. Additionally, the autodetector logic for generating migrations might need to be reviewed.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
