This crash occurs in Django 1.11.10 and involves a ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. The issue seems to be related to the handling of constraints, specifically when both unique_together and index_together are defined on the same fields. Based on the reported issue, the relevant code spans are likely to be found in the database schema editor handling the deletion of constraints, particularly in the _delete_composed_index method.\n\nFrom the search results, the following code spans are identified as relevant:\n- django/db/backends/base/schema.py: The _delete_composed_index method in BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class (span id 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index') is directly related to the issue, as it raises the ValueError when it finds the wrong number of constraints. This method needs to be examined to understand how it identifies and handles the constraints.\n- django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py: The _delete_composed_index method in DatabaseSchemaEditor class (span id 'DatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index') inherits from BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor and might have additional specific implementations for MySQL. This is also relevant for understanding how different database backends handle the constraint deletion.\n- django/db/migrations/operations/models.py: The AlterUniqueTogether and AlterIndexTogether classes (span ids 'AlterUniqueTogether' and 'AlterIndexTogether') are relevant as they define the operations for altering these constraints during migrations. Understanding how these operations are defined and executed can provide insight into the issue.\n- django/db/models/base.py: The _check_index_together and _check_unique_together methods in the Model class (span ids 'Model._check_index_together' and 'Model._check_unique_together') are responsible for ensuring the correctness of these constraints at the model level. Although these methods do not directly handle the deletion, they provide context on how the constraints are validated and might indicate how they are intended to interact with each other.\n\nThese code spans are crucial for understanding the issue and potential fixes or improvements to handle the deletion of index_together when unique_together is defined on the same fields. The search task is considered complete with these identified spans.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
