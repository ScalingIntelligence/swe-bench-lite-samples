In 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py', the '_delete_composed_index' method is critical as it handles the deletion of composite indexes, and it's where the ValueError is raised due to finding the wrong number of constraints. Similarly, 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' contains the operations for altering unique_together and index_together, which are directly related to the issue at hand.

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
