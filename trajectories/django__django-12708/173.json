This problem occurs specifically in the Django 1.11.10 framework and is related to the _delete_composed_index method in the schema editor. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals that there are several relevant sections in the django/db/backends/base/schema.py file, particularly focusing on the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor class and its methods like alter_unique_together, alter_index_together, and _delete_composed_index. These methods are directly involved in managing unique and index constraints, and the issue might stem from how they interact when both constraints exist on the same fields. Additionally, the django/db/migrations/operations/models.py file contains the AlterUniqueTogether and AlterIndexTogether classes, which are also relevant as they handle changes to these constraints during migrations. No issues or inconsistencies were found in the analysis of these code spans, but the focus should be on ensuring that the deletion of one constraint does not adversely affect the other.",

No way to get out of this...\nThe worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the \"new\" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.\nI think there are 2 different points here:\n1) The deletion of index_together should be possible alone or made coherent (migrations side?) with unique_together\n2) Moving the declaration of an index should not result in an index re-creation\n"
