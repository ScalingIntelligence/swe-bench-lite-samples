Two main parts are identified: 1) Vectors break pretty printing, and 2) When it does print correctly, the baseline is wrong (it should be centered). Relevant files provided are from the sympy package, specifically those handling vector, dyadic, printing, and latex functionalities. Focus should be on methods such as `_pretty`, `_print_BasisDependent`, `_print_Vector`, and similar, to understand how vector printing is managed and potentially identify where modifications or corrections are needed.",

Within 'vector.py', the focus should be on the methods '_latex', '_pretty', and '__str__', which handle the printing of vectors in different formats. 'dyadic.py' has similar methods for handling dyadic objects, which are also relevant to the printing of vectors. The search results confirm that both files contain logic for formatting vector and dyadic objects, with a particular focus on the '_latex' and '_pretty' methods to address the LaTeX printing and pretty-printing issues reported in the issue. The methods ensure that the coefficients of basis vectors are properly printed, including handling cases where the coefficient is 1 or -1, as these should not be explicitly printed. Additionally, the '_pretty' method involves complex logic to ensure proper baseline alignment for pretty printing. Overall, the search results provide a comprehensive overview of the code responsible for the printing of vector objects, which aligns with the reported issue.",
