The relevant code spans should therefore focus on pretty printing functionalities for vectors. In the provided search results, the file 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py' contains a class 'Vector' with a method '_pretty' which seems to handle the pretty printing of vectors. Additionally, in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', there are methods '_print_BasisDependent' and '_print_Mul' that could be relevant as they deal with pretty printing for basis-dependent expressions and multiplications, which could include vectors. This method '_pretty' in 'vector.py' directly deals with vector printing and thus is highly likely relevant. Similarly, '_print_BasisDependent' could be responsible for types involving basis vectors. '_print_Mul' is also suspect as it might deal with printing of multiplication expressions, which can involve vector operations.

Specifically, the example provided shows incorrect formatting for the expression (x/y)**t*e.j. The issue also mentions that when the pretty printing does work correctly, the baseline alignment is wrong (it should be centered). Given this, the relevant code spans should focus on the pretty printing of vectors and their components, particularly in terms of how expressions are translated into pretty forms. After examining the provided file context and search results, it's clear that the primary focus should be on the methods and classes related to pretty printing within the 'sympy.physics.vector.vector' module and the 'PrettyPrinter' class in 'sympy.printing.pretty.pretty'. Additionally, since the issue involves vectors, the 'sympy.vector' module should also be considered for any related pretty printing methods or classes. From the provided search results, the '_print_BasisDependent' method in the 'PrettyPrinter' class is particularly relevant as it directly handles the printing of vector components, and the '_pretty' method in the 'Vector' class is also pertinent as it is responsible for generating the pretty form of vector objects. This covers the primary concerns of the issue, and further examination of related methods or classes in the context of pretty printing would likely reveal any additional needed adjustments for correct baseline alignment and comprehensive handling of vector expressions.",
