The error in question arises specifically with the pretty printing of expressions involving vectors, potentially related to how the Pow (power) and BasisDependent classes are handled in the _pretty methods. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the Vector class and its _pretty method in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py, as well as the PrettyPrinter class in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py, which contains methods for pretty printing various mathematical expressions. Additionally, the VectorPrettyPrinter class in sympy/physics/vector/printing.py might also be relevant since it extends the PrettyPrinter class specifically for vector-related printing issues. Lastly, the Pow class, which deals with power expressions, in sympy/printing/str.py also needs attention since it could be influencing how vector expressions are printed when they involve powers.",

Given these specifics, the search results should ideally contain code spans that handle the pretty printing functionality for vectors, especially those related to handling power terms and aligning vector components.\n\nUpon examining the provided search results, several relevant code spans are identified in the 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py' and 'sympy/physics/vector/printing.py' files.

Furthermore, the 'VectorPrettyPrinter' class in 'printing.py' also seems relevant as it extends from 'PrettyPrinter' and is likely responsible for handling specific aspects of vector pretty printing, possibly including how power terms are treated.\n\nBased on these observations, the search task can be considered complete as the relevant code spans for addressing the reported issue are found within the provided search results.",
