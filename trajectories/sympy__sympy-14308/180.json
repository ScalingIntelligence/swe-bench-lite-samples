The problem includes not only incorrect pretty printing but also the incorrect baseline alignment. Given the files provided, the main focus should be on the `Vector` and `PrettyPrinter` classes as well as their methods related to pretty printing. Additionally, the `VectorPrettyPrinter` class in the `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` file is likely relevant due to its specialization in vector printing. It would be beneficial to specifically look for implementations of `_print_Pow` and methods dealing with BasisDependent objects, as powers and vector components are central to the issue described.",

The baseline alignment is also mentioned as an issue when printing correctly. After analyzing the search results, the following key points can be identified:\n\n1. The `PrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains methods responsible for pretty printing expressions, including vectors and powers. The `_print_Pow` method in this class handles the pretty printing of 'Pow' expressions. Adjustments here could potentially resolve the issues with how powers are printed in vectors.\n2. The `VectorPrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` also deals with pretty printing, particularly focusing on vectors. The `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Function` methods in this class could be relevant for ensuring proper pretty printing of vector components that involve derivatives or functions.\n\nGiven these points, the identified code spans are likely relevant to fixing the pretty printing issues mentioned in the reported issue. Specifically, modifying the `_print_Pow` method in `PrettyPrinter` and potentially refining the `VectorPrettyPrinter` methods could help address the pretty printing issues with vectors and powers.",
