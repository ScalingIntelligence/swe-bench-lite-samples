Specifically, Dyadic._latex and Dyadic._pretty address LaTeX formatting and pretty printing for dyadic expressions, which are crucial for understanding complex vector products. Vector._pretty handles similar tasks for standard vector expressions. The PrettyPrinter class in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py and the VectorPrettyPrinter in sympy/physics/vector/printing.py provide overarching mechanisms for different types of specialized or generic pretty printing needs, affecting both dyadics and vectors.\n\nThese spans are selected because they directly relate to the formatting output issues described in the issue, involving both correct representation and alignment of vector components in printed outputs.",

Additionally, the PrettyPrinter class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` manages the rendering of BasisDependent objects, including vectors. The _print_Mul and _print_Pow methods in this class handle the multiplication and exponentiation operations respectively, which are crucial for correctly displaying expressions with division and exponentiation. Adjusting these methods to ensure proper alignment and centering of the output may require modifications to how strings are concatenated and how spacing is managed within the pretty printing logic.",

From the initial context, it's evident that files `dyadic.py` and `vector.py` are instrumental in pretty printing vectors. The focus seems to be on methods `Dyadic._pretty` and `Vector._pretty`. Analysis of the provided search results further supports this by revealing that the methods `Vector.__init__` and `Vector._pretty` in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` are likely relevant due to their involvement in defining and visually representing vectors. Particularly, `Vector.__init__` constructs vector objects from input lists, which are then processed in the `Vector._pretty` method for pretty printing. This method deals with the visual rendering, handling of coefficients, and concatenation for the final string representation. Furthermore, the `PrettyPrinter._print_Pow` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` deals with the pretty printing of expressions involving powers, which is likely relevant to the reported issue due to the exponentiation aspect. Given the provided context and search results, these methods' relevance is clear, particularly in addressing the issue of incorrect pretty printing of vectors with exponents and ensuring proper centering, making the search task complete regarding the reported issue.",
