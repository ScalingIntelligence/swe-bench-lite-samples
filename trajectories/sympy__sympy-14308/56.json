The user provides an example where the pretty printing of a vector expression is incorrect, both in terms of the output format and the baseline alignment. The search results include files related to vector and dyadic handling in SymPy, as well as files that involve pretty printing functionalities. Since the issue is about pretty printing, it's crucial to look at how vectors are pretty printed in these files, including the Dyadic and Vector classes, and the PrettyPrinter class which handles the pretty printing logic.\n\nFor the Dyadic class, the _latex and _pretty methods are relevant as they deal with the pretty printing of dyadic objects. The _pretty method in the Vector class is also targeted as it customizes the pretty printing for vector objects. The PrettyPrinter class from the pretty.py contains general pretty printing logic and is extended in the VectorPrettyPrinter, which is used by the Dyadic and Vector classes for pretty printing logic specific to vectors. This part of the code is essential to identify as it might contain the logic causing the misalignment or incorrect format during pretty printing.\n\nBased on the issue description and the code context, there are specific areas in the provided files that need to be updated to address the pretty printing issues correctly. This might involve changes in the PrettyPrinter class to handle Vector and Dyadic objects differently for better alignment and output formatting. Therefore, the relevant spans from these files need to be updated to correctly align the vector output during pretty printing and fix the unwanted '+' signs in the output.",
