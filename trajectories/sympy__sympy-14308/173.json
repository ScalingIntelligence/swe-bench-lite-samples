We need to identify code spans related to vector printing and baseline alignment. From the search results, we can see multiple relevant spans in the `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` and `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py` files. Specifically, spans `Vector._pretty` and `Dyadic._pretty` are directly related to the pretty printing functionality for vectors and dyadics, respectively. These spans handle the construction of pretty representations for these objects, including how coefficients and basis vectors are combined in the output. Additionally, the `Vector._latex` span provides LaTeX formatting for vectors, which could be relevant if the issue also affects LaTeX output. The `PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent` span in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` is also relevant as it deals with the pretty printing of BasisDependent objects, a superclass for vectors and dyadics. While the issue does not explicitly mention LaTeX, the baseline alignment, which is incorrect in the pretty printing, might also be an issue in LaTeX rendering. Therefore, these identified spans should cover the relevant code for addressing the pretty printing and baseline alignment issues for vectors.",

Additionally, the Dyadic class in sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py also has similar methods. The PrettyPrinter class in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py handles the pretty printing for various expressions, including BasisDependent objects, which may be relevant to vector and dyadic representations. The VectorPrettyPrinter and VectorLatexPrinter classes, defined in sympy/physics/vector/printing.py, are specialized for printing vector expressions.

The issue specifically mentions that when vectors are printed, the formatting is broken, and the baseline is incorrect. This suggests that the methods responsible for pretty printing, such as `_pretty` and `_latex`, are the focus. \n\nFrom the provided search results, we see that there are several relevant files including `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`, and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. These files contain classes and methods that are directly involved in the pretty printing of vectors, dyadics, and other related mathematical objects.\n\nThe `Vector` class in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` has methods like `_pretty` and `_latex` which are responsible for the visual representation of vectors. Similarly, the `Dyadic` class in `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py` also has `_pretty` and `_latex` methods, indicating they are involved in the printing of dyadics.\n\nThe `PrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains the logic for pretty printing various objects, and its methods such as `_print_BasisDependent` directly handle the printing of basis-dependent objects like vectors.\n\nFrom the context provided, it seems that the identified spans in these files (`sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`, and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`) are relevant to the reported issue. These spans include the `_pretty` and `_latex` methods within the `Vector` and `Dyadic` classes, as well as the methods in the `PrettyPrinter` class, especially those dealing with basis-dependent objects.

The search results add further context by including additional methods from 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' and 'sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py'. The '_print_nth_root' method in 'PrettyPrinter' is particularly relevant as it deals with the representation of roots, which include exponents, in pretty print form. This method could be extended or modified to address the issue with exponents in vector expressions. Additionally, the '_print_BasisDependent' method in 'PrettyPrinter' directly handles the pretty printing of basis-dependent objects like vectors, suggesting that adjusting this method could potentially fix the alignment issue. The 'Dyadic' class in 'sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py', although not directly related to vector pretty printing, could provide insights into how expressions are currently handled and printed.
