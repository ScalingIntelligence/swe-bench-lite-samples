The issue mentions that vectors break pretty printing and also points out a problem with the baseline alignment when printing correctly. Given this, the following steps were taken to identify relevant code spans:\n1. Checked the imports to understand the context.\n2. Analyzed the Vector class in vector.py, particularly focusing on the _pretty method, which is responsible for pretty printing vectors.\n3. Examined the PrettyPrinter class in pretty.py, specifically looking at methods involving printing of Pow and other related operations that might affect the pretty printing of vectors.\n4. Reviewed the Dyadic class in dyadic.py, as it also handles pretty printing and might be related to the issue.\n\nFrom the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified and listed in the 'identified_spans' field below.",
