This method handles the pretty printing of vectors, including their alignment and how components are formatted during printing. The '_pretty' method is found within the file 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py', specifically in the 'Vector' class span starting from 'challenging look to envision', and significant to the solution in this situation.\n\nRegarding the file 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', there are multiple spans that deal with pretty printing, handling various types of expressions. However, none of these directly pertain to the pretty printing of vectors as described in the issue. The issue is more specifically about vectors in the vector module, and the relevant code is found within 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py'.\n\nThus, while 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' has a broader approach to pretty printing in SymPy, the specific issue of vector pretty printing is addressed in 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py'.

These components involve methods for handling vector expressions, specifically for pretty printing. Since the issue revolves around vector pretty printing, the presence of _pretty in the Vector class and _print_Derivative, _print_Function in the VectorPrettyPrinter are highly relevant. The context hints at a structured approach to printing vector expressions, which is as per the desired functionality mentioned in the issue. Roughly assessing this, it seems that relevant spans might be enough for the task bar ten looking deeper.\n\nHowever, a further analysis is needed, specifically paying attention to how expressions involving vectors are actually combined with other mathematical expressions and how they may break the pretty printing or lead to alignment issues. This requires looking into how different components (like _pretty or _print_Function) handle various mathematical entities in expressions. Since I cannot fetch a broader codebase or more code segments, this viewpoint is limited.\n\nConsidering the context provided tackles some core aspects tailored to fix the outlined issues, the resultant observations fall short of full confidence, directing towards using specific search paths only these are of significance because generating without broader context pulls in an optimistic note rather than a certain one.",
