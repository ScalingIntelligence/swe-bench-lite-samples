The '_pretty' method in the 'Vector' class constructs the pretty representation by iterating over parts of the vector expression, conditionally wrapping pieces with parentheses for clarity, and concatenating them together. The 'Dyadic' class's '_pretty' method follows a similar approach but for dyadic expressions. Both methods use the 'prettyForm' utility from SymPy for managing the alignment and concatenation of various parts of the output. The '_print_Pow' and '_print_Mul' methods in the 'PrettyPrinter' class handle the pretty printing of powers and multiplications, respectively, which are central to the pretty printing of mathematical expressions involving vectors, and might indirectly influence the alignment issue reported.
