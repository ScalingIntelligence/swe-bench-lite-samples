The key methods identified are `Dyadic._latex`, `Dyadic._pretty`, `Vector._pretty`, and various methods in `PrettyPrinter` that handle the pretty printing of vector-related operations. These methods are crucial for understanding how vectors are printed in the SymPy library and thus directly relevant to the reported issue.
