The search results contain a `Vector._pretty` method which is responsible for the pretty printing of vectors. This method is directly relevant to the issue as it deals with how vectors are displayed in a more readable format.\n\nSince the `_pretty` method is directly related to the pretty printing functionality, it should be inspected in detail to determine if it correctly handles the formatting of vectors, including ensuring that the baseline is centered and that expressions like `(x/y)**t*e.j` are printed correctly.

The provided context and search results reveal that the relevant code spans reside within the 'PrettyPrinter' class in the 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' file. This class contains methods for printing various mathematical expressions, including vectors, which are likely to be pertinent to the issue at hand. The '_print_BasisDependent' method, in particular, deals with the pretty printing of BasisDependent objects, which include vectors. This method is likely the primary focus for addressing the issue due to its direct handling of vector representation in the pretty printing output. Notably, the method uses Unicode for representing vectors, which is likely related to the alignment and formatting issues described in the issue. Therefore, the key spans to focus on are the '_print_BasisDependent' and possibly the '_print_vector' methods, if it exists.
