The search results provide a relevant file, 'vector.py', which contains the 'Vector' class along with its methods, including '__init__' for initializing the vector and '_pretty' for handling the pretty printing. The '_pretty' method is particularly relevant as it directly deals with formatting the vector's pretty representation, including handling coefficients and basis vectors. This method's handling of coefficients could be the area where the pretty printing breaks, or where adjustments are needed to align the baseline properly. Therefore, the '_pretty' method's span is identified as relevant to address the reported issue.",
