The relevant files and methods indicate that the pretty printing functionality is spread across multiple files, particularly in 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py', 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', and 'sympy/physics/vector/printing.py'. These files contain methods like '_pretty', '_print_BasisDependent', '_print_Vector', '_print_Pow', etc., which are likely involved in handling the pretty printing of vector expressions. A targeted search focusing on these methods and files should help locate the exact points of failure or misalignment for the vectors in pretty printing.",

The search results expand on these with additional methods like `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Function` in `VectorPrettyPrinter` and similar methods in `VectorStrPrinter` and `VectorLatexPrinter`.\n\nTo address the issue:\n1. Identify methods in `Vector` that are related to pretty printing.\n2. Inspect `VectorPrettyPrinter`, `VectorStrPrinter`, and `VectorLatexPrinter` for methods handling derivatives and functions.\n3. Evaluate if the methods in `Vector` correctly utilize the printers for accurate representation.\n\nThe relevant code spans would include:\n- `Vector._pretty` from `vector.py`\n- `VectorPrettyPrinter._print_Derivative` and `_print_Function` from `printing.py`\n- Perhaps `VectorStrPrinter._print_Derivative` and `_print_Function` as well, although detailed relevance depends on whether the issue occurs in both pretty and string representations.\n\nGiven these considerations, the search task is not yet complete as the direct handling of vector exponentiation (as it relates to the issue of alignment) does not seem to be handled in the identified spans, which predominantly address vector display via coefficients and basis vectors.",

The '_pretty' method constructs a 'Fake' object that handles the pretty printing of vectors, iterating over vector components and their basis vectors. Notably, it handles cases where the coefficient of the basis vector is 1 or -1 specially to avoid printing these coefficients explicitly. The 'VectorPrettyPrinter' class in 'sympy/physics/vector/printing.py' is designed to handle specific types of pretty printing for vector-related objects, including derivatives and functions. The search should concentrate on fine-tuning these methods to ensure correct and aesthetically pleasing representation of vectors, addressing the noted issues with baseline and exponent handling.",

Reviewing the '_pretty' method in the 'Vector' class, it seems to handle the pretty printing of vector components. The current implementation seems to iterate over components and print them, but it doesn't handle the exponentiation case well. The `_print_Symbol` and `_print_Function` methods in `VectorPrettyPrinter` might be involved in the representation of the components. To address the issue, we should focus on enhancing the `_pretty` method to correctly handle cases involving exponents and ensure that the printing aligns correctly. The first step is to update the way components are iterated and printed, especially considering exponent expressions, and adjust the alignment as needed.",
