This method deals with assembling the vector components for pretty printing, including handling coefficients and basis vectors. The '_print_BasisDependent' method in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' also contributes to the pretty printing of vector or related objects, handling their representation in a unicode-aware context.

Upon examining the provided `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` file, we can observe that the `_pretty` method directly handles the pretty printing of vector objects. This method contains logic for skipping coefficients of 1 or -1 and printing vectors in a readable format. However, it does not explicitly address baseline alignment, suggesting there might be other methods involved in formatting the output string. In the file `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, several methods are present for printing objects in pretty form, such as `_print_BasisDependent`, which could potentially handle vector alignment issues if overridden for the specific BasisDependent classes. Given that an attempt to fix the printing problem is described in the issue but not explicitly covered in the provided files, it's likely that relevant modifications or additional methods might exist elsewhere in the codebase, possibly in other parts of the `printing` or `physics/vector` modules.",

The relevant code spans likely involve the methods responsible for pretty printing vectors. From the provided context and search results, I've identified two critical spans in the codebase that are relevant to the issue: The '_pretty' method in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py and '_print_BasisDependent' method in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py. These methods are responsible for formatting and printing vectors in a pretty way. Additionally, the 'xsym' method in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_symbology.py handles symbols used in pretty printing, which could indirectly affect the vector printing if it provides the symbols used in the vector formatting. Therefore, these spans should be inspected to determine if they correctly handle the alignment and formatting of vector components, which is crucial for resolving the reported issue. No further search results seem to be directly related to the reported issue of vector pretty printing, which indicates that the provided search results might be complete in the context of addressing the issue.",
