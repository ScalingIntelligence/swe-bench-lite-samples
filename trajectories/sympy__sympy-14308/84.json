            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about vectors breaking pretty printing in SymPy. The issue shows an example where vector operations are not printing correctly and suggests that the baseline for printing should be centered. Given the context and the nature of the issue, it's clear that the relevant code spans should be focused on the printing and formatting functions within the vector module and the associated printer modules. The files and spans that are relevant include those handling LaTeX and pretty printing for vectors, as these are the mechanisms failing. Notably, the issue involves both LaTeX and pretty printers, suggesting importance for spans related to both printing formats. The identified spans include both the Dyadic class and the Vector class, which are central to vector operations in SymPy. Additionally, the printing methods within these classes and the general printing utilities like LatexPrinter and PrettyPrinter are crucial as they directly handle the conversion of vector expressions to printable formats. The spans related to handling powers and derivatives, especially in the context of functions involving vectors, are also relevant as they involve detailed formatting that could be contributing to the issue. Overall, the search results provide a comprehensive set of code spans that are directly or indirectly involved in the printing process of vector entities in SymPy, which are critical to addressing the reported issue.",
