Initially, two files were investigated: 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py' and 'sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py'. Relevant code spans from these files include methods related to pretty printing vectors and dyadics, specifically '_pretty' methods that handle the rendering of these objects. In 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py', the '_pretty' method deals with the rendering logic of Vector objects, including the handling of coefficients like 1 or -1, which are crucial for addressing the issue of pretty printing. Additionally, in 'sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py', the '_pretty' method for Dyadic objects was found, which also includes logic for printing coefficients and uses Unicode symbols for pretty printing. Furthermore, 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' contains a broader set of pretty printing utilities and classes, which could influence how vectors and other mathematical objects are printed. The '_print_BasisDependent' method in this file specifically deals with printing objects dependent on a basis, which includes vectors, thus making it highly relevant to the issue at hand. This method also handles the special case of coefficients being 1 or -1, managing edge cases reported in the issue. Overall, these methods provide a comprehensive view of pretty printing logic in SymPy relevant to vectors, covering both specific and general printing tasks.",

        "message": "The issue involves pretty printing vectors in SymPy. The errors are: 1) 'vectors break pretty printing' with a specific example showing incorrect output, and 2) baseline alignment issues when pretty printing works correctly. The relevant files already identified include 'vector.py', 'dyadic.py', and 'pretty.py'. These files contain classes and methods related to vector and dyadic pretty printing. Given the context, the focus should be on the '_pretty' method implementations in these classes, as well as any related functions or classes in 'pretty.py' that handle the pretty printing of BasisDependent objects. Furthermore, considering the integration with other printing functionalities like LaTeX, it's also relevant to look into 'printing.py', 'latex.py', 'cg.py', 'str.py', and 'tensorproduct.py' for more context. The search should prioritize methods handling pretty printing of vectors and dyadics, and any configurations or settings that might affect this functionality.",
