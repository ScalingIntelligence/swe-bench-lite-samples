Given the problem description and the provided code, several critical files and methods might be responsible for this behavior. Relevant files include `vector.py`, `pretty.py`, `printing.py`, `dyadic.py`, and others. The methods `_pretty` and `__str__` in these files are likely culprits as they handle the pretty printing and string representation of vectors. Additionally, the `_print_Pow` method in `pretty.py` might be relevant to handle the exponentiation in the vector expression. Therefore, a search focusing on these files and methods will help pinpoint the exact location of the problem.",

From the search results, there are multiple files and spans of code that are relevant to this issue. The files 'dyadic.py' and 'vector.py' both contain code related to vector operations and pretty printing. Notably, both files have methods for LaTeX and pretty printing (_latex and _pretty respectively). These methods are directly involved in generating the string representations of vectors and dyadics, which could be the source of the problem. In particular, the _pretty methods in both classes ('Dyadic' and 'Vector') handle the pretty printing functionality. These methods iterate over the components of the dyadics/vectors, construct their pretty representations, and handle their baselines.

From the provided context, we can see that the pretty printing methods for Dyadic and Vector classes are already identified. However, the problem needs to be addressed across different files, such as 'dyadic.py', 'vector.py', and 'pretty.py'. There are also additional methods like '__add__', '__mul__', '__sub__', '__xor__', '__rxor__', '__rsub__', and 'applyfunc' in 'dyadic.py' that might not be directly related to printing but could affect the behavior around vector operations.\n\nFor 'dyadic.py', the methods '_latex' and '_pretty' in the 'Dyadic' class handle the pretty printing with LaTeX and pretty printing formats, respectively. The issue likely lies within these methods or in how these are utilized elsewhere. The 'Vector' class in 'vector.py' has similar methods, '_latex' and '_pretty', that also handle printing formats, suggesting that changes may be needed here as well.\n\nIn 'pretty.py', the '_hprint_vec' and '_print_Pow' methods in the 'PrettyPrinter' class support printing vectors and powers, which could also be related to the vector printing issue. Checking or modifying these methods might help fix the baseline and overall pretty printing of vectors.",
