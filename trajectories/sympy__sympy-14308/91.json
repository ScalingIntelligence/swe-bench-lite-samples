The search results contain multiple files with mentions of '_pretty' methods, which is a strong indicator of where the pretty printing logic resides for both vectors and dyadics. It's notable that the issue specifically mentions the misalignment of the baseline in printing, which indicates a need to review how baselines are handled in the pretty printing methods. The identified code spans in 'vector.py' and 'dyadic.py' not only contain the '_pretty' methods but also the logic that decides how to format the output. Furthermore, the issue includes an example of incorrect pretty printing, which correlates with the logic inside '_pretty' method in the 'Vector' class, suggesting that this is an important section to focus on. The initialization and rendering logic within these methods are likely areas of interest that should be reviewed closely. Following these steps, the relevant code spans can be extracted from the provided search results.",
