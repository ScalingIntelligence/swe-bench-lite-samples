From the search results, there are multiple files and spans that are relevant to the pretty printing of vectors and their components. The key files are 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py' and 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py'. In 'vector.py', the '_pretty' method in the 'Vector' class is directly responsible for the pretty printing of vectors. This method uses the 'VectorPrettyPrinter' to format the vector components. Additionally, the '_latex' method is relevant as it formats vectors for LaTeX output, which might also be used for pretty printing in certain contexts. In 'pretty.py', the 'PrettyPrinter' class has methods like '_print_Dot' and '_print_BasisDependent' that are relevant to printing vector operations and basis-dependent objects respectively. These methods format the vector components and handle their alignment. Given these findings, it's apparent that the code spans related to pretty printing in both files are relevant to addressing the issue of vectors breaking pretty printing and the wrong baseline alignment. The identified spans in 'vector.py' and 'pretty.py' cover the necessary functionality to improve the pretty printing of vector expressions.",
