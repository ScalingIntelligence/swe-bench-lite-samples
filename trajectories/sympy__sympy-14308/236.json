Given the current context, no relevant code has been identified yet, which makes it necessary to analyze the provided search results for any relevant code spans.\n\n3. In the search results, several code spans appear relevant:\n\n   - In sympy/physics/vector/vector.py, the span 'Vector._pretty' is about generating a pretty-print representation of a Vector object. This includes handling of coefficients and basis vectors, which could be relevant to the alignment issue reported.\n\n   - In sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py, several spans are about various methods of the PrettyPrinter class, which is likely responsible for generating pretty representations of mathematical expressions. The methods '_print_BasisDependent' and '_print_Pow' seem particularly relevant, as they respectively handle the printing of vector-like objects and power expressions, which could include handling of fractions.\n\n   - In sympy/physics/vector/printing.py, the span 'VectorPrettyPrinter._print_Derivative' is about printing derivatives in a vector context. Although not directly about vector printing itself, handling derivatives could involve similar alignment issues.\n\nThese spans collectively handle aspects of pretty printing that are directly or indirectly related to the issues reported, such as correct alignment and handling of complex expressions like fractions.",
