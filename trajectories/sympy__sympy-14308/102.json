            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is that vectors break pretty printing in SymPy. This involves two main parts: the incorrect output for vector expressions and the wrong baseline alignment when the vectors do print correctly. From the search results, there are multiple files that seem relevant:\n\n1. `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py` contains detailed handling for LaTeX and pretty printing of Dyadics, which are tensor objects of rank one. The methods `_latex` and `_pretty` within the Dyadic class are particularly relevant as they specifically deal with the formatting of these objects in both LaTeX and pretty printed formats.\n2. `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` also has similar methods `_pretty` within the Vector class, which are responsible for handling pretty printing of Vector objects.\n3. `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` is a general printer for SymPy objects and includes handling for BasisDependent objects among others. The method `_print_BasisDependent` inside the PrettyPrinter class seems relevant as it deals with the pretty printing of basis dependent objects, which includes vectors.\n\nFrom examining these files, I will focus on extracting the spans that are directly related to the pretty printing and LaTeX printing of vector objects to address the specific issues reported. These spans are the `Dyadic._latex`, `Dyadic._pretty`, `Vector._pretty`, and `PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent`, as they directly concern how vector objects are formatted and displayed in output.\n\nThis extraction will help in identifying the exact areas of the codebase that need to be inspected or modified to address the pretty printing issues with vectors.",

The issue specifically mentions that the output format is incorrect, such as using 'e_j' instead of expected coordinates and notation. Also, it notes that the baseline for correct printing should be centered. The initial file context provided includes references to '_pretty' methods in 'dyadic.py' and 'vector.py'. This suggests that modifications in these files are necessary to troubleshoot and correct the output issue. The new search results confirm the methods relevant to vector and dyadic pretty printing, particularly '_print_Mul' in 'pretty.py' which might handle multiplication operations that could relate to the vector operations in issue. Therefore, these files and methods are likely target areas to focus on fix the reported issue.",
