The problem includes incorrect formatting when a fraction is raised to a power and multiplied by a vector, leading to misalignment of the vector glyph in output. Relevant methods could be `_pretty` or similar methods in classes handling vector and dyadic representations, as well as in printers like `VectorPrettyPrinter` in the `sympy.physics.vector.printing` module.",
