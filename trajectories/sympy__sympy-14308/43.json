Reviewed the current file context: None provided; this is the initial search.\n\n3. Processed new search results:\n   a. Focused on `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` as it contains the `Vector` class and its methods `_pretty` and `_latex`, which are directly related to pretty printing.\n   b. Reviewed the `Vector._pretty` method: It handles the pretty printing of vector components and coefficients, which aligns with the alignment and vector component issues described in the issue.\n   c. Reviewed the `Vector._latex` method: It similarly deals with printing vector components in LaTeX format, which is relevant for mathematical formatting.\n   d. Considered other files, like `dyadic.py` and `printing.py`, but they were less directly related to the reported issue of vectors breaking pretty printing.\n\n4. Decision: The `Vector._pretty` method in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` is the most relevant part of the codebase for addressing the reported issue. The alignment of the output and the handling of vector components within the pretty printing mechanism are central to fixing the problem described.",

The search results from 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' provide additional context on how pretty printing is handled in SymPy, including the 'PrettyPrinter' class and various methods for printing different types of expressions. The '_print_Mul' and '_print_Pow' methods are relevant as they handle multiplication and exponentiation, which are common operations involving vectors. The '_print_BasisDependent' method is also pertinent as it specifically deals with the pretty printing of expressions dependent on basis vectors, which is directly related to vector operations.

The issue provides an example where the pretty printing breaks and another where the baseline is misaligned. Key files and spans identified from the search results include: sympy/physics/vector/vector.py, which contains the `Vector` class and its methods, including `_pretty` which is responsible for pretty printing vectors. Additionally, sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py contains the `PrettyPrinter` class which is essential for the pretty printing functionality, especially the methods `_print_BasisDependent` and `_print_Mul` concerning basis-dependent objects and multiplication respectively. The search results also include other printers such as `LatexPrinter`, `StrPrinter`, `MathMLContentPrinter`, etc., which illustrate how different printers handle special cases, including `Pow` and `Mul`. These are crucial for understanding how different representations might handle the reported issue. From the analysis, it's evident that the `_pretty` method in `Vector` and `_print_BasisDependent` in `PrettyPrinter` are central to addressing the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The file context provided includes the Vector class in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py, which contains a _pretty method that delegates to VectorPrettyPrinter for pretty printing. This is relevant to the issue reported, as it involves the pretty printing of vectors. Additionally, the _print_Mul and _print_Pow methods in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py are also relevant because they handle the pretty printing of mathematical operations like multiplication and exponentiation, which are involved in the issue. However, the VectorPrettyPrinter class itself, which is likely critical for resolving the issue, is missing from the context. This suggests that the file context is incomplete without the sympy/physics/vector/printing.py file, where VectorPrettyPrinter is expected to be defined. Therefore, while significant parts of the context are relevant, there is an important missing component.",
