The expected behavior described involves correctly formatting expressions such as (x/y)^t*e.j, ensuring that the baseline for printing is centered, and avoiding breaking the pretty printing functionality. The search results reveal several relevant classes and methods that deal with pretty printing, specifically focusing on TensorProduct, Dyadic, and Vector classes which are central to the issue. The _pretty methods within these classes are particularly relevant as they directly handle the pretty printing logic. Additionally, the PrettyPrinter class is included as it contains methods that might influence the printing of BasisDependent objects, which include Dyadic and Vector. Overall, these code spans align well with the reported issue and provide a solid foundation to address the pretty printing defects for vector operations.",
