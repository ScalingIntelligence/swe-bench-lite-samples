The provided search results contain code spans that are relevant to pretty printing, specifically focusing on the methods related to vector pretty printing and general pretty printing in SymPy. The 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py' file contains a method '_pretty' in the 'Vector' class that deals explicitly with the pretty printing of vectors, including handling the rendering of basis vectors and their coefficients. Additionally, the 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' file includes a 'PrettyPrinter' class with methods that handle various aspects of pretty printing, including 'Factorial', 'Floor', 'Product', 'BasisDependent', and others. These methods are crucial for understanding how symbols, expressions, and equations are rendered in a human-readable format. By analyzing these code spans, it becomes evident that they are highly relevant to the reported issue, as they directly address the pretty printing functionalities needed to resolve the problem. Thus, the relevant code spans selected are from these files, which are primarily concerned with the pretty printing of vector expressions and general mathematical expressions in SymPy.",
