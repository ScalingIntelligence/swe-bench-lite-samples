This is crucial since blueprints can now be nested, making every dot significant. The search results include a file 'src/flask/blueprints.py', which contains several code spans that are relevant to blueprints. Specifically, the 'Blueprint' class and its '__init__' method handle the initialization of blueprint names, which is a direct point of interest concerning name validation. The 'add_url_rule' method within the 'Blueprint' class also deals with handling URL rules and could potentially be a place where such validation might be applied. These spans cover the essential logic related to how blueprints are named and added to the application. Therefore, dealing with the 'name' attribute in the '__init__' method and the endpoint handling in the 'add_url_rule' method could lead to a solution that prevents blueprint names from containing dots.",
