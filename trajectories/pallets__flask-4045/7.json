Additionally, the `add_url_rule` method in `BlueprintSetupState` is relevant since it deals with the registration of blueprints in the application. Other sections like the imports and other method implementations in the `Blueprint` class are not directly related to the validation of the blueprint name but provide context on how blueprints are intended to be handled and structured within the application.
