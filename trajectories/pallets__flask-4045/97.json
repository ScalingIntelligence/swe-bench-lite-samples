From the search results, the primary focus is on understanding where blueprint names are processed and how they can be validated. The file 'src/flask/blueprints.py' is especially relevant, as it contains the Blueprint class methods that handle registration, which is where the name validation would likely be implemented. Specifically, the 'register' method within the Blueprint class seems to be the place where a new validation check can be added to ensure that the blueprint name does not contain a dot. This method is responsible for registering the blueprint with the app and could easily incorporate the desired error-raising functionality. No existing validation was found in the provided code, indicating that this is an area where a new feature needs to be implemented.\n\nAdditionally, the 'add_url_rule' method within the same Blueprint class checks for dots in endpoints and raises an assertion if a dot is found. This existing validation suggests how similar validation can be implemented for the blueprint name in the 'register' method.",

The search results reaffirm the presence of these sections, underlining their relevance to the reported issue. Notably, the 'Blueprint.__init__' method setting the 'name' attribute and the 'register' method handling blueprint registration could be pivotal from a name validation perspective. The 'add_url_rule' method, part of both the 'Blueprint' class and 'BlueprintSetupState' class, also appears crucial for URL rule management. It's discernible that the existing code may need amendments or additional validations for the 'name' attribute to prohibit dots, ensuring that all candidate places for such validations are diligently inspected. Nevertheless, the presented search results adequately address the fundamental functionalities implicated in this issue, though further inquiry for a direct solution implementation like a validation function could be valuable.
