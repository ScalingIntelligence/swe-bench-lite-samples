In the search results, the 'src/flask/blueprints.py' file contains several spans that are relevant to managing blueprints and their names. Notably, the 'Blueprint' class and its methods would be the primary focus, especially where the blueprint's name is set or validated. The '__init__' method of the 'Blueprint' class initializes the blueprint with a 'name' parameter which should be checked for the presence of dots. Additionally, the 'add_url_rule' method has assertions preventing dots in endpoints and view function names, indicating a place where similar validation for the blueprint name could be implemented. Since the issue specifies needing an error like the one for endpoints, which is already implemented, these sections are highly relevant for implementing the new error for blueprint names containing dots.",
