The new search results provide additional context from 'flask/app.py', particularly the 'register_blueprint' method within the Flask class. This method is crucial as it involves the registration of blueprints to the application, which is directly related to the blueprint naming issue. By examining the code spans in the new search results, it's clear that the Flask class's 'register_blueprint' method interacts with the Blueprint class, making it relevant to the issue at hand. Specifically, the method calls 'blueprint.register(self, options)', indicating that at this point in the code, the blueprint's name (which could contain a dot) might need inspection or validation to enforce the rule against dots. This would be a logical place to implement the error raising mechanism if the blueprint name contains a dot. Given this analysis, the next steps would involve identifying the exact area where this validation or error raising would be implemented, possibly around the Blueprint registration process.",
