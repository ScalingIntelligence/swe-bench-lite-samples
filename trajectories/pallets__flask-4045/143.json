The current context indicates no relevant code has been identified yet. The search results provided include several code spans related to blueprint handling, including the initialization of Blueprint, the addition of URL rules, and the registration of blueprints. Notably, the span `Blueprint.__init__` is relevant as it initializes the blueprint with a name, and any validation on the name could be added here. The span `Blueprint.add_url_rule` is also relevant, as it directly handles adding URL rules and already contains an assertion to ensure that the endpoint does not contain dots. This precaution is in line with the requirement to handle dots in names carefully. Additionally, the span `Blueprint.register_blueprint` is relevant for similar reasons, as it involves the handling and registration of blueprints. Based on these findings, the identified spans should cover the essentials for addressing the issue.",
