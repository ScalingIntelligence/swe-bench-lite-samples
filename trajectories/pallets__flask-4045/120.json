The `__init__` method of the `Blueprint` class accepts a `name` parameter, which could be used to validate the name. Additionally, the `add_url_rule` method contains checks to ensure that the endpoint name does not contain a dot, which is a similar validation that should be applied to the blueprint name.\n\nThe `Flask` class in `src/flask/app.py` is also relevant as it includes methods like `register_blueprint` which interacts with blueprints. This method could potentially be used to raise an error if a blueprint name contains a dot.\n\nGiven the context of the issue, the focus should be on methods that interact with or validate blueprint names.

Therefore, the search focus should be on how blueprints are registered and initialized within the Flask framework. The provided search results include the `Flask.register_blueprint` method, which is crucial for blueprint registration. Inside this method, the `blueprint.register` function is called, which indicates that the handling of blueprint registration and possibly validation occurs within the `Blueprint` class methods (not present in the search results but inferred as essential based on the `blueprint.register` call). Given this context, the relevant span is the one containing how blueprints are registered in the Flask app, even though it does not explicitly include the validation code for the blueprint name's dot checks.
