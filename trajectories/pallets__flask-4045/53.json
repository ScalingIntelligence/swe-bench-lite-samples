Currently, no relevant code has been identified yet. By examining the provided search results, focusing on functions and methods related to blueprints and URL rules, I can identify potential areas of relevance.\n\nIn 'src/flask/app.py', the 'add_url_rule' method within the 'Flask' class is relevant as it handles route registration, which is directly related to endpoints and blueprints. This method is responsible for endpoint assignment and rule addition to the URL map, making it a critical part of the blueprint and routing system.\n\nIn 'src/flask/blueprints.py', the 'Blueprint' class and its methods such as 'register_blueprint', 'register', and 'add_url_rule' are highly relevant. These methods manage blueprint registration and URL rule addition, which are central to managing nested blueprints and enforcing naming conventions. Specifically, the 'add_url_rule' method in this context is notable for its checks on endpoint names and view function names to ensure they do not contain dots, hinting at existing constraints that could be refined to address the issue.\n\nThis analysis suggests that focus should be on these methods to implement or enhance the error-raising logic specifically for blueprint names containing dots.\n\nGiven this context, the following code spans in the search results appear to be most relevant to the reported issue:\n- The 'add_url_rule' method in both the 'Flask' class ('src/flask/app.py') and the 'Blueprint' class ('src/flask/blueprints.py'), as these are directly involved in handling endpoints and URL rules.\n- The 'register_blueprint' and 'register' methods in the 'Blueprint' class ('src/flask/blueprints.py'), as these manage the lifecycle of blueprints and could be critical in enforcing new naming conventions or error handling for blueprint names.\n\nBy examining and potentially modifying these code spans, it should be possible to address the issue of raising errors for blueprint names containing dots.",
