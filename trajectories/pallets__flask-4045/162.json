The search results reveal several relevant areas in the codebase. In 'src/flask/app.py', the 'Flask' class methods 'register_blueprint' and 'add_url_rule' are relevant because they handle the registration of blueprints and URL rules, which are central to this issue. In 'src/flask/blueprints.py', the 'Blueprint' class method 'add_url_rule' contains specific assertions about dots in endpoints and view function names, directly addressing the issue. This is crucial for preventing the use of invalid blueprint names. Finally, in 'src/flask/scaffold.py', the 'Scaffold' class contains a placeholder method 'add_url_rule', which indicates that the functionality is implemented in derived classes like 'Flask' and 'Blueprint'. These findings suggest that the necessary checks and potential additions to handle the reported issue are already integrated or are intended to be in these parts of the codebase.",
