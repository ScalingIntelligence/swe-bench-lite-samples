These spans deal directly with the initialization and validation of blueprint names and their endpoints, aligning closely with the problem statement and requirements for error raising. No actionable content is found in 'app.py' related to directly handling or raising the exception for blueprint names containing dots. Thus, the focus should remain on refining or adding the error handling mechanism within the 'Blueprint' class methods in 'blueprints.py'.

However, there doesn't seem to be any check or error handling specifically for the blueprint name containing a dot in the initial context provided.\n\nMoving on to the new search results, I see additional spans within the `Blueprint` class and the `BlueprintSetupState` class. Notably, the `Blueprint.__init__` method is present again, and there is a new method `Blueprint.register_blueprint` which might be significant for nested blueprints. However, neither of these methods currently checks if the blueprint name contains a dot and raises an error as required by the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the task requires identifying or suggesting where in the existing codebase or in these methods an error should be raised if the blueprint name contains a dot. Since no specific code span currently addresses this, I will not mark any spans as identified. It might be necessary to suggest or implement such a check in the relevant part of the codebase (e.g., in the `Blueprint.__init__` method or the `register_blueprint` method).",
