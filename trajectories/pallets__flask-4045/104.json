The relevant code spans are likely those related to the initialization and handling of blueprints in the Flask app. From the provided search results, the crucial spans are within the 'Blueprint' class and the 'Flask' class, specifically those methods dealing with the registration and validation of blueprint names. The 'Blueprint.__init__' and 'Blueprint.register' methods are relevant as they deal with the creation and registration of blueprints, which is where a name check for dots would be appropriate. Additionally, the 'Flask.register_blueprint' method is relevant as it ties into the registration process at the app level.
