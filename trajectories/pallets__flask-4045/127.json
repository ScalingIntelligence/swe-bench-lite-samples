Specifically, the issue can be addressed in the `__init__` method of the `Blueprint` class, where the `name` attribute is set. Additionally, the `add_url_rule` method of the `Blueprint` class already contains assertions that disallow dots in endpoints and view function names, which can be extended to check the blueprint name.\n\nIn `src/flask/blueprints.py`, the `Blueprint` class has an `__init__` method where the `name` is initialized. This is the appropriate place to add a check for dots in the blueprint name. Furthermore, the `add_url_rule` method also has checks for dots in endpoint names and view function names, which could be utilized or modified to include a check for the blueprint name. There is no need to check `src/flask/app.py` as it does not directly relate to the initialization or naming of blueprints.\n\nThis analysis concludes that the current search results are sufficient to address the reported issue by adding a check for dots in the blueprint name within the `Blueprint` class.",
