This functionality needs to be implemented similarly to how it was done for endpoint names. Given the search results, the most relevant sections are those dealing with the initialization and registration of blueprints. Specifically, the Blueprint class and its methods provide context on how blueprints are instantiated and registered within the Flask application. The __init__ method of the Blueprint class, where the blueprint name is assigned, is particularly relevant as it is where the validation for the blueprint name should ideally be added. Additionally, the register method in the Blueprint class is crucial as it is where the blueprint is integrated into the application, providing an opportunity to enforce constraints on the blueprint name post-initialization. Further investigation would be needed to ensure all relevant sections are identified, especially focusing on where name validation logic should be integrated to align with existing error handling practices.",

The search results did not yield any specific code spans related to this validation. Based on the context, particularly the 'Blueprint' class's '__init__' method where blueprint names are initialized and the 'register' method where blueprints are registered with the application, it is logical to implement the validation in one of these places. The 'register' method includes an assertion for name collision, suggesting a similar pattern could be used for dot validation. Additionally, the 'Scaffold' class, inherited by 'Blueprint', and the 'Flask' class, which interacts with blueprints, could offer insights on similar validation strategies. Without specific spans indicating where this validation should be added, it is advisable to insert the validation logic within the 'Blueprint' class's '__init__' or 'register' methods.",
