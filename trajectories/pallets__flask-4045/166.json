The search results provided in `src/flask/blueprints.py` contain several relevant sections: the `Blueprint` class definition, particularly the `Blueprint.__init__` and `Blueprint.add_url_rule` methods, which both deal with blueprint name initialization and validation. Additionally, the `Blueprint.register_blueprint` method could also be relevant if it deals with nested blueprints. These sections are directly related to handling blueprint names and rules, making them strong candidates for further inspection or modification to address the issue of raising an error when a blueprint name contains a dot.
