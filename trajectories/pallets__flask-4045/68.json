After a thorough review of the search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are primarily located within the 'Blueprint' class and its associated methods. Specifically, the 'Blueprint.__init__' span is relevant for initializing the blueprint name which is a potential target for validation. The 'Blueprint.add_url_rule' span is also relevant as it directly deals with endpoints and rules, which need to be checked for dots. Additionally, the 'Blueprint.register' span is crucial as it handles the registration of blueprints to the app, and a validation check for dots in blueprint names should be integrated here. It's important to ensure that these validations are introduced in a way that does not disrupt the existing functionality but effectively addresses the reported issue.",

Additionally, the `add_url_rule` method within the `Blueprint` class is relevant because it handles URL rules and endpoints, which are tied to blueprint names. There is a brief mention of a check for dots in endpoints and view function names within the `add_url_rule` method, but no explicit check for dots in the blueprint name itself. Despite this, the context provides a clear picture of how blueprints are managed and suggests where such a validation might be added.
