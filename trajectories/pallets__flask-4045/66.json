The current codebase already has a check for dots in endpoint names but lacks a similar check for blueprint names. The search results confirm the presence of the `Blueprint` class and its methods, such as `__init__` and `register`, which are instrumental in initializing and registering blueprints. These methods do not currently include a check for dots in blueprint names, making them relevant for implementing the required validation. Additionally, the `add_url_rule` method in the `BlueprintSetupState` class is also relevant as it constructs endpoint names that include blueprint names, reinforcing the need to ensure blueprint names do not contain dots. The identified spans are crucial for understanding where the validation mechanism should be integrated within the blueprint lifecycle.
