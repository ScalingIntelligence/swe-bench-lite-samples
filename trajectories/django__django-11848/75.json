The provided search results include the `parse_http_date` function, which contains the logic for parsing HTTP dates, including the problematic handling of two-digit years. This function is directly relevant to the reported issue. The code span identified includes the lines where the year is parsed and the logic that needs to be corrected. Specifically, the function needs to compare the two-digit year with the current year to determine the correct century, as per RFC 7231. The function `parse_http_date_safe` is also included, which is a safer version of `parse_http_date` but does not address the core issue directly.
