The RFC suggests that timestamps in the rfc850-date format with a two-digit year should be interpreted based on their proximity to the current year, rather than a fixed 0-69 and 70-99 range. Given this context, the relevant code span to address the issue is the one that contains the 'parse_http_date' function and its year interpretation logic. The other parts, such as the import statements and the definitions of regular expressions, while necessary for context and understanding the broader implementation, do not directly pertain to the specific logic that needs to be corrected based on the reported issue.",
