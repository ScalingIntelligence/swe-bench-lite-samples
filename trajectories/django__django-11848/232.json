The search results contain the relevant code in the `django/utils/http.py` file. Specifically, the `parse_http_date` function is the one that handles the date parsing. This function uses regular expressions for different date formats, including RFC850, and then processes the year to adjust for the two-digit year.

The function should instead compare the year with the current year to interpret the two-digit year correctly.",
