By examining the provided search results, it's clear that the 'parse_http_date' function contains the logic that needs to be modified. The function uses regular expressions for different date formats and then processes the year based on these patterns. The code span responsible for this logic is contained within the 'parse_http_date' span. Additionally, there's a related function 'parse_http_date_safe' which calls 'parse_http_date' and handles exceptions, but it is not directly related to the issue at hand.
