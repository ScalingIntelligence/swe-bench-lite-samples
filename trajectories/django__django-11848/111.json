The current error in Django's logic is that it's hardcoded to understand years 0-69 as 2000-2069 and years 70-99 as 1970-1999, whereas it should be relative to the current year.

Specifically, the issue highlights that the current logic incorrectly hard codes the interpretation of years 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999, instead of comparing these years against the current year. The RFC 7231 states that recipients of a timestamp in rfc850-date format, which uses a two-digit year, MUST interpret a timestamp that appears to be more than 50 years in the future as representing the most recent year in the past that had the same last two digits. This implies a dynamic calculation based on the current year is required. In the provided search results, the function `parse_http_date` is identified as containing the logic that needs to be adjusted. This function is responsible for parsing HTTP dates according to different formats, including RFC850 which is the format under scrutiny.
