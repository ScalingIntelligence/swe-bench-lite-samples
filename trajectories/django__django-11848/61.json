The RFC mentions that when dealing with two-digit years in HTTP dates, recipients should interpret years in the future that appear to be more than 50 years as being the most recent past year with the same last two digits. The current logic in Django's `parse_http_date` function does not adhere to this requirement, as it incorrectly maps 0-69 to 2000-2069 and 70-99 to 1970-1999 without considering the current year.
