According to the issue, the current logic incorrectly categorizes years 0-69 as 2000-2069 and years 70-99 as 1970-1999, instead of comparing them against the current year. This aligns with the problematic logic present in the `parse_http_date` function. To address this, one should review the function's handling of two-digit years and adjust it to correctly interpret years based on the RFC's guidance. The span identified as 'parse_http_date' contains the essential logic that processes the HTTP date and needs to be adjusted. The accompanying 'imports' span provides necessary context for understanding how functions and modules from other parts of the codebase are leveraged in `parse_http_date`. However, the 'parse_http_date_safe' span is related to error handling and does not directly address the immediate issue.",
