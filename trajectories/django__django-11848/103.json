Specifically, the function currently hard codes the interpretation of years in the 20th and 21st centuries, which does not align with the requirement to compare the two-digit year with the current year to determine the correct century. In the provided code, the `parse_http_date` function is identified and is relevant to the reported issue. This function uses regular expressions to parse different date formats, including the RFC850 format which involves two-digit years. The function then processes the year by adding 2000 if the year is less than 70 and 1900 if the year is 70 or greater. This hard-coded logic needs to be revised to correctly handle dates as per the RFC specifications. The `parse_http_date_safe` function, which attempts to call `parse_http_date` and handles exceptions, is also identified but does not directly address the issue at hand. Therefore, the relevant code spans are the ones defined by the IDs 'imports' and 'parse_http_date' in the `django/utils/http.py` file.",
