This specification requires that a timestamp with a two-digit year should be interpreted in the context of the current year, with years appearing to be more than 50 years in the future being interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\nThe `parse_http_date` function is found in the `django/utils/http.py` file within the `parse_http_date` span. This function contains the logic that needs to be modified to correctly handle two-digit years as per the RFC 7231 specification. Additionally, the `RFC850_DATE` regex pattern is relevant as it is the pattern used for dates in RFC 850 format, which uses two-digit years.\n\nBased on the analysis, the `parse_http_date` span in the `django/utils/http.py` file is identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
