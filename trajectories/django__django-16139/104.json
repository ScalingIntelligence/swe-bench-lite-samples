The problem is that the URL generated for the password change form is incorrect, leading to a 404 error. The solution involves adjusting the form's help text to correctly reference the password change URL based on the User's primary key. In the provided search results, the relevant code spans include the UserAdmin class definition and its methods, particularly the get_urls method which defines the URL pattern for changing a user's password. This code is crucial for understanding how the password change feature is intended to work and how it might be misbehaving due to the to_field parameter.

  "initial_message": "Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Kern)\n\t \nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this: \nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tpassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\n\t\tlabel=_(\"Password\"),\n\t\thelp_text=_(\n\t\t\t\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\t\t\t\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n\t\t\t'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n\t\t),\n\t)\n\t...\n\t...\n\tdef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\t\tpassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\n\t\tif password:\n\t\t\tpassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n\t...\n\t...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n"
