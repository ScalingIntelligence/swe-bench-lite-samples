The solution involves updating the password help text to include the user's primary key in the URL, ensuring the correct redirection to the PasswordResetForm.\n\nIn analyzing the search results, the code spans of interest are within the class UserAdmin, particularly the UserChangeForm and the change_password_form. The UserChangeForm contains the problematic password field with a relative URL in its help text. The UserAdmin class definition also shows how the UserChangeForm is used and how the password change functionality is integrated, including the method UserAdmin.user_change_password which handles the password change view.\n\nBased on the issue description and the search results, the relevant code spans are identified where modifications would need to be made to fix the broken link.",

  "initial_message": "Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Kern)\n\t \nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this: \nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tpassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\n\t\tlabel=_(\"Password\"),\n\t\thelp_text=_(\n\t\t\t\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\t\t\t\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n\t\t\t'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n\t\t),\n\t)\n\t...\n\t...\n\tdef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\t\tpassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\n\t\tif password:\n\t\t\tpassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n\t...\n\t...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n"
