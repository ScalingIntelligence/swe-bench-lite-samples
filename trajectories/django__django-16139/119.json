The broken link leads to a 404 error because the URL for the PasswordResetForm is incorrect. The issue suggests that if the UserAdmin is accessed via its UUID instead of its primary key, the link to the PasswordResetForm is generated incorrectly. This can be fixed by dynamically generating the link based on the User's primary key rather than assuming a static path. The search results provided include the UserAdmin class within django/contrib/auth/admin.py, which contains the relevant methods and fields to address this issue. Specifically, the UserAdmin.user_change_password method and the UserAdmin.get_urls method are relevant, as they handle password-related operations and URL routing, respectively. Additionally, the UserChangeForm class is imported within the file, which is likely where the password field's help text is being modified incorrectly. These sections of code should be examined and potentially modified to correctly generate the link based on the User's primary key.",

  "initial_message": "Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Kern)\n\t \nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this: \nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tpassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\n\t\tlabel=_(\"Password\"),\n\t\thelp_text=_(\n\t\t\t\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\t\t\t\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n\t\t\t'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n\t\t),\n\t)\n\t...\n\t...\n\tdef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\t\tpassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\n\t\tif password:\n\t\t\tpassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n\t...\n\t...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n"
