The provided search results include relevant code spans from the `django/contrib/admin/options.py` file, specifically the `ModelAdmin` class and its methods, which handle the admin change form view and response logic. These methods (`response_add`, `_changeform_view`) deal with the logic for saving new objects and displaying change forms, which are directly related to the issue at hand. The code spans also include settings and definitions relevant to the admin interface and object management, such as `BaseModelAdmin` and its methods, providing context for how admin views are constructed and managed. This context is crucial for understanding the flow and behavior of the admin views, which is essential for addressing the issue.

  "initial_message": "Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Kern)\n\t \nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this: \nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tpassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\n\t\tlabel=_(\"Password\"),\n\t\thelp_text=_(\n\t\t\t\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\t\t\t\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n\t\t\t'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n\t\t),\n\t)\n\t...\n\t...\n\tdef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\t\tpassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\n\t\tif password:\n\t\t\tpassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n\t...\n\t...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n"
