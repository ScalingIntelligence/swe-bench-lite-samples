Given that the UserChangeForm is a key part of the process where the password help text is initialized and its link is set, it is important to ensure we are looking at the correct part of the code, including any initialization methods for this form. Also, since the issue involves the relative path not accounting for access via non-primary key fields, it may be necessary to widen the search to include any methods in UserAdmin that handle the generation or manipulation of URLs, or any methods in the UserChangeForm itself that dynamically set text based on the instance. I suggest performing a broad search for any mentions of 'password.help_text' or 'UserChangeForm' in the `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` file, as this file should contain the UserChangeForm class with the fields that need modification. Additionally, it's possible that the UserAdmin class in `django/contrib/auth/admin.py` has overrides or specific configurations for the form or user-specific views that need to be checked. This broader search will ensure we capture any relevant part of the code, even if it's not explicit in our first-pass search criteria.",

  "initial_message": "Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Kern)\n\t \nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this: \nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tpassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\n\t\tlabel=_(\"Password\"),\n\t\thelp_text=_(\n\t\t\t\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\t\t\t\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n\t\t\t'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n\t\t),\n\t)\n\t...\n\t...\n\tdef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\t\tpassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\n\t\tif password:\n\t\t\tpassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n\t...\n\t...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n"
