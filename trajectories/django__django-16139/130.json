The provided search results contain several code spans related to the UserAdmin class, which is the primary point of interest as the issue originates from this admin interface. Notably, the code includes the definition of the UserAdmin class with its various methods and properties, such as 'get_fieldsets', 'get_form', 'get_urls', and 'user_change_password'. These methods are directly related to handling user instances in the admin interface, making them highly relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the search results include the 'UserAdmin.get_urls' method, which defines the URL structure for changing passwords and is therefore directly related to the broken link described in the issue. This method receives special attention as it specifies the path for the password change view. Based on the reported issue, the code relevant to the UserChangeForm and how the password field is handled is necessary. Specifically, the '__init__' method in the UserChangeForm where the password help text is manipulated includes the problematic '../password/' reference that leads to a 404 error. This method is not directly included in the provided search results but is referenced in the issue description, suggesting the need for further investigation if not available in the search results. For now, focusing on the UserAdmin class and its methods is the logical step as these handle core functionalities related to the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Kern)\n\t \nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this: \nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tpassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\n\t\tlabel=_(\"Password\"),\n\t\thelp_text=_(\n\t\t\t\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\t\t\t\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n\t\t\t'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n\t\t),\n\t)\n\t...\n\t...\n\tdef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\t\tpassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\n\t\tif password:\n\t\t\tpassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n\t...\n\t...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n"
