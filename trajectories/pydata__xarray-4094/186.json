The second file, 'xarray/core/merge.py', includes the 'MergeError' class, which is the exception raised in the provided MCVE code sample.\n\nBased on the search results, the most relevant code span is 'DataArray.to_unstacked_dataset' from 'xarray/core/dataarray.py', as it directly pertains to the method in question. Additionally, understanding the 'MergeError' class and its usage in 'xarray/core/merge.py' might also be helpful in addressing the issue.\n\nSince the relevant method 'to_unstacked_dataset' has been identified, along with the exception type 'MergeError', this completes the search for relevant code spans concerning the reported issue.",
