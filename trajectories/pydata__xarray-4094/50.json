This issue is relevant to the 'Dataset' class in the xarray library, particularly focusing on the 'to_stacked_array' method for stacking variables and the subsequent unstacking process. The search results include relevant code spans from 'xarray/core/dataset.py', particularly the 'Dataset' class and its 'to_stacked_array' method. These code spans contain the necessary functionalities related to stacking and unstacking variables. No specific code span for 'to_unstacked_dataset' was found in the provided search results, but the issue context implies that the problem lies in the merge process after unstacking, which is indirectly related to the 'MergeError' class defined in 'xarray/core/merge.py'.",
