Firstly, the `Dataset` class definition and its `__init__` method are found in `xarray/core/dataset.py`, which is foundational for understanding how datasets are constructed. More crucially, the `to_stacked_array` method is also located in this file, detailing the implementation of the stack operation. The error class `MergeError` is found in `xarray/core/merge.py`, which is relevant as it is likely involved in the unstacking operation that results in the reported `MergeError`. These findings are directly related to the reported issue: they implement the stack/unstack operations and manage the potential errors that arise during these operations.",
