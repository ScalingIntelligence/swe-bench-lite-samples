Key methods like `to_rgba`, which converts data values to RGBA colors, and `_scale_norm`, which handles scaling of the norm, are present and should be examined for potential faults. Additionally, the setter for `norm` in `ScalarMappable` (span_ids: 'ScalarMappable.norm_10') involves setting the norm, suggesting this area could be critical to the issue's resolution. Further, the method `set_norm` (span_ids: 'ScalarMappable.set_norm') could directly influence the behavior related to the norm being set after the colorbar is created.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about setting a `LogNorm` after a colorbar has been created which results in an `Invalid vmin or vmax` error in matplotlib 3.6.3. This issue involves understanding how norms are set and used within the ScalarMappable class and its interactions with the colors.Normalize class and its subclasses. The code spans identified in the `lib/matplotlib/cm.py` file are relevant to this issue as they detail how norms and cmaps are managed within ScalarMappable, specifically focusing on the `ScalarMappable.norm` property and its setter, as well as methods like `ScalarMappable.set_norm`, `ScalarMappable._scale_norm`, and `ScalarMappable.to_rgba`. These methods are key to understanding how norms are applied and could potentially lead to errors if not managed correctly. The new search results from `lib/matplotlib/colors.py` provide additional context on how the `Normalize` class and its subclasses, like `TwoSlopeNorm` and `CenteredNorm`, manage vmin and vmax values. This includes methods like `Normalize.__init__`, `Normalize.autoscale`, `Normalize.autoscale_None`, and `TwoSlopeNorm.autoscale_None`. These methods show the logic for scaling and setting limits, which could be directly related to the error described in the reported issue if the conditions for vmin and vmax are not met. It's important to review these sections in detail to understand any changes or constraints introduced in the version that might be causing the error. Additionally, the `make_norm_from_scale` and `_make_norm_from_scale` functions are relevant as they dynamically create norm classes that could be used in the error scenario. The `_picklable_norm_constructor` is less relevant but is included as it pertains to the overall norm creation process. Based on these observations, the identified spans from both results are indeed relevant to investigating and potentially resolving the `Invalid vmin or vmax` error reported in issue.",
