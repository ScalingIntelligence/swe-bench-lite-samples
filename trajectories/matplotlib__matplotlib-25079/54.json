Additionally, the `matplotlib/__init__.py` and `matplotlib/pyplot.py` files might also be relevant as they initialize and provide the interface to matplotlib.

The `Norm.__call__` method is especially relevant as it contains the logic for transforming values and raising the `ValueError: Invalid vmin or vmax` if the transformed `vmin` and `vmax` values are not finite.
