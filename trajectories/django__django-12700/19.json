Upon reviewing the provided context and search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are those that define and manipulate the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class and its methods, especially `cleanse_setting`. This method currently lacks handling for non-dict iterables, which is the issue at hand. Therefore, the search results confirm the presence of the problematic method and provide a clear basis for the required adjustments to address the reported issue.
