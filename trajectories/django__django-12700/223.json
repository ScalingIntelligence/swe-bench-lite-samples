The current implementation of `cleanse_setting()` only checks if the value is a dictionary and processes it accordingly. This is in line with the example provided, where nested lists and dictionaries containing sensitive information are not being cleansed in versions of Django 3.1 and above.\n\nFrom the search results, the most relevant part of the code is within the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class. Specifically, the `cleanse_setting()` method needs to be modified to handle other types of iterables such as lists and tuples, in addition to dictionaries. The `get_safe_settings()` method calls `cleanse_setting()` for each setting, so any changes to how settings are cleansed will directly affect this method.\n\nThis is a crucial point because, in its current form, the function potentially leaks sensitive information when settings contain nested iterables. Enhancing `cleanse_setting()` and ensuring it processes all types of iterables will be necessary to fully resolve the reported issue.\n\nGiven these observations, the identified code spans are those within the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class that need to be altered or extended to correctly handle and cleanse nested iterables.",

Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we \u200bonly take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but \u200breturn them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n"
