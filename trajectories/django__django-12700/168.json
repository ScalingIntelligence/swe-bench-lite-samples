The search results reveal the relevant portion of the codebase, specifically the methods 'cleanse_setting' and 'get_safe_settings' within the 'SafeExceptionReporterFilter' class. These methods are critical for handling and securing settings, but the current implementation only considers dicts, potentially leaving other iterable types unprocessed. This aligns with the issue's description concerning insufficient cleansing of settings.\n\nThe identified spans are:\n- 'SafeExceptionReporterFilter.cleanse_setting': This method currently processes settings but lacks handling for non-dict iterables.\n- 'SafeExceptionReporterFilter.get_safe_settings': This method aggregates the settings and applies the cleansing method. Analyzing these spans is crucial to understand how settings are currently processed and to implement necessary enhancements to handle all types of iterables.",

Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we \u200bonly take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but \u200breturn them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n"
