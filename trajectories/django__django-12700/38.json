This method currently checks if the value is a dictionary and recursively cleanses it. However, it lacks handling for other types of iterables like lists, which is the core issue mentioned in the reported issue.

The primary concern is that cleanse_setting() in SafeExceptionReporterFilter only handles dictionaries and doesn't manage other iterable types well. This leads to un-cleansed values in the settings being returned. The example reveals that nested lists in MY_SETTING are not being cleansed in Django versions 3.0 and below. From the search results, the SafeExceptionReporterFilter class in django/views/debug.py contains the cleanse_setting() method which directly addresses the issue by checking if the value is a dict and handling it accordingly, but it misses handling other types of iterables. The circumstantial evidence also points to the django/conf/__init__.py file, as it contains settings-related configurations which might be relevant to the issue due to potential settings manipulations but this file's content doesn't specifically relate to the cleansing issue itself. However, the primary focus is on expanding the cleanse_setting() method's capabilities to cover other iterable types apart from dictionaries specifically in django/views/debug.py.",

Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we \u200bonly take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but \u200breturn them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n"
