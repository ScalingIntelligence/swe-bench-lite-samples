The issue is that the `cleanse_setting` method only handles `dict` types and does not cleanse other types of iterables like lists. The provided search results show the relevant class and method, which confirms the issue. The `cleanse_setting` method indeed only processes `dict` types and returns other types as-is, which aligns with the reported issue. The `get_safe_settings` method uses `cleanse_setting` to create a cleansed settings dictionary, which will include un-cleansed iterables if they are not dictionaries. The search results also include a method in another file (`make_hashable`) that deals with making iterables hashable, which might be relevant for a potential solution to handle all types of iterables in the `cleanse_setting` method. However, the reported issue does not directly mention the need for hashable values, so this method might not be directly relevant for the current issue resolution, but it could be useful for a more comprehensive solution in the future.",

Specifically, the `cleanse_setting` method does not handle other types of iterables such as lists correctly. The example provided in the issue shows that nested lists and dictionaries are not being cleansed as expected in Django versions 3.1 and up. The current implementation of `cleanse_setting` only checks for `dict` types and returns other types such as lists as-is. The relevant code spans to address this issue are those within the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class, particularly the `cleanse_setting` method. The search results include the full definition of the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class and its methods, which allows for a comprehensive review of the cleansing mechanism.

  "initial_message": "Settings are cleaned insufficiently.\nDescription\n\t\nPosting publicly after checking with the rest of the security team.\nI just ran into a case where django.views.debug.SafeExceptionReporterFilter.get_safe_settings() would return several un-cleansed values. Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we \u200bonly take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but \u200breturn them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n"
