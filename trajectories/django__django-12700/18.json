The problem arises because the cleanse_setting function only handles 'dict' types but doesn't account for other iterable types, returning them as-is.

To address this, we need to search for the cleanse_setting function in the 'django.views.debug' module and review how settings are being handled and cleansed. Additionally, since the problem involves handling various iterable types in settings, it would be beneficial to search for any other functions or classes that may be involved in the cleansing process of settings.",

The analysis of the provided code reveals the existing logic in the `cleanse_setting` method, which needs to be expanded to account for various iterable types.

The method currently handles only `dict` types for cleansing, which aligns with the issue description. The task is to extend this method to handle other iterable types as well. This involves modifying the `cleanse_setting` method to recursively handle types like lists, tuples, and sets. Given this context, there seems to be no need for further search in other files for the `cleanse_setting` method, as it has already been found in the specified file.
