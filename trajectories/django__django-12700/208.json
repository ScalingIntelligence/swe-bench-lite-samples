Examining the provided code, I see the possibility to iterate over all elements of iterables (e.g., lists, tuples, etc.) and apply recursion to cleanse them.Of greatest interest is the SafeExceptionReporterFilter class and specifically, the cleanse_setting method. Reading the comments in the cleanse_setting method indicates the current implementation specifically handles dicts, as captured in the issue by the user. Furthermore, since other iterables will have sensitive values returned without sanitation to them, such an oversight could expose the application to inadvertent system compromise when returning them to potential apps. Both the complete implementation or implementing new functions specifically for each iterable (in case widespread modifications are not permissible) might also be possible. Consequently, expanding this method or developing new methods could be relevant to completely cleanse sensitive settings throughout the entirety of an application and ensure that no secret tokens, etc. are inadvertently printed. Moreover, the context for sanitizing including determining which settings need to be cleansed (API secrets, tokens, etc), and using applicable replacement strings is worthwhile further inspection.  Identifying how sensitive settings are currently being handled will be useful from an observation standpoint. Expanding the functionality while retaining backward compatibility is crucial.",

  "initial_message": "Settings are cleaned insufficiently.\nDescription\n\t\nPosting publicly after checking with the rest of the security team.\nI just ran into a case where django.views.debug.SafeExceptionReporterFilter.get_safe_settings() would return several un-cleansed values. Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we \u200bonly take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but \u200breturn them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n"
