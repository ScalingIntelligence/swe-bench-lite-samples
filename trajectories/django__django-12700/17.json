The example provided demonstrates that certain sensitive data within nested structures (like lists of dictionaries) are not properly cleansed. Upon examining the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are primarily located within the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class, specifically the methods `cleanse_setting` and `get_safe_settings`. The `cleanse_setting` method currently only properly handles dictionaries but fails to process other iterable types like lists. This matches the issue described, where nested lists containing dictionaries are returned without being cleansed. The `get_safe_settings` method, while calling `cleanse_setting` for each setting, does not address this broader handling of iterables. Thus, these methods need to be updated to ensure all iterable types, including nested structures, are properly cleansed to prevent the exposure of sensitive data.",

These methods are crucial for understanding how settings are cleansed and retrieved. Additionally, the `callable` handling within `cleanse_setting` is also relevant, although not directly related to the issue at hand.
