This oversight leads to sensitive information in these other iterable types not being properly cleaned or obscured. The provided code snippet from `django/views/debug.py` includes the relevant `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class with its methods `cleanse_setting` and `get_safe_settings`. The `cleanse_setting` method is particularly important as it is where the cleaning logic is implemented. The method currently checks if the value is a `dict` and recursively cleanses it. However, it lacks handling for other iterable types like lists. This omission is what causes the issue reported. The provided code demonstrates that the existing implementation is inadequate for handling other iterable types, which directly matches the issue reported.",

Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we \u200bonly take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but \u200breturn them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n"
