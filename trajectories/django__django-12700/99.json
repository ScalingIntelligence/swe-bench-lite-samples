The issue points out that the cleanse_setting method currently handles dictionaries but does not adequately handle other types of iterables like lists. This is evidenced by the example provided where nested lists of dictionaries are not properly cleansed. Reviewing the code in the search results, the SafeExceptionReporterFilter class and its methods are directly related to the issue. Specifically, the cleanse_setting method, which is responsible for cleansing sensitive settings, should be updated to handle iterable types other than dictionaries. The get_safe_settings method, which wraps around cleanse_setting to cleanse all settings and return them, is also relevant as it directly produces the output under scrutiny. The functionality of handling iterables in cleanse_setting needs enhancement to ensure that nested structures within settings are adequately processed.",
