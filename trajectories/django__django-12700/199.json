The problem is that settings are not being sufficiently cleansed, especially when dealing with iterables other than dicts. The cleanse_setting method needs to be extended to handle other types of iterables. To address this, we should first locate the cleanse_setting method and the get_safe_settings method in the django/views/debug.py file, as these are likely where the issue resides. Additionally, we should check the settings module (django/conf/__init__.py) to understand how settings are managed and potentially where additional cleansing logic should be applied.",

Specifically, it highlights that the cleanse_setting method currently only handles dictionaries, failing to address other iterable types. This is evident in the provided example where nested lists and dictionaries remain uncleansed. The search results provide code spans that are highly relevant to the issue. In 'django/views/debug.py', the SafeExceptionReporterFilter class, including the cleanse_setting and get_safe_settings methods, is present, showcasing the current implementation that needs enhancement. Additionally, 'django/conf/__init__.py' reveals the LazySettings and Settings classes, although less directly related to the specific cleansing issue, they provide context on how settings are loaded and managed in Django. These insights help understand broader interactions with settings that could affect the cleansing process. Based on these findings, I identify 'SafeExceptionReporterFilter.cleanse_setting' and 'SafeExceptionReporterFilter.get_safe_settings' as the most relevant spans to address the issue, with an awareness that future implementations may require adjustments in the Settings and LazySettings areas depending on the solution approach.",

  "initial_message": "Settings are cleaned insufficiently.\nDescription\n\t\nPosting publicly after checking with the rest of the security team.\nI just ran into a case where django.views.debug.SafeExceptionReporterFilter.get_safe_settings() would return several un-cleansed values. Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we \u200bonly take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but \u200breturn them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n"
