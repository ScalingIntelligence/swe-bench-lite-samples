The primary focus is on the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class, which includes methods `cleanse_setting` and `get_safe_settings`. The current implementation of `cleanse_setting` only handles dictionaries and not other types of iterables, which is the core problem. The provided search results include the relevant code from `django/views/debug.py`, specifically the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class and its methods. This code is directly related to the issue since it deals with filtering sensitive information from settings. The `cleanse_setting` method needs to be enhanced to handle more types of iterables, which is not currently done. Therefore, the relevant code spans are identified within the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class.",

The issue notes that `cleanse_setting` only handles `dict` types and returns other iterable types as-is, which can lead to un-cleansed sensitive data being exposed. Based on the provided file context and search results, the relevant code spans are located in `django/views/debug.py`. Specifically, the methods `cleanse_setting` and `get_safe_settings` in the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class need to be addressed to ensure all types of iterables are properly cleansed. Additionally, the file `django/conf/__init__.py` contains the `LazySettings` and `Settings` classes which are responsible for handling and configuring settings, potentially relevant if the issue requires a broader settings-related fix.\n\n1. Analyzing User Instructions: The issue is clearly about ensuring that settings are properly cleansed to prevent exposure of sensitive data. The example provided illustrates the problem with nested iterables not being cleansed.\n2. Review Current Context: The existing file context includes the `django/views/debug.py` file, specifically the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class with its methods `cleanse_setting` and `get_safe_settings`, directly related to the issue.\n3. Process New Search Results: The new search results confirm the presence of `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` and related methods in `django/views/debug.py`, bolstering the relevance of this file to the issue. Additionally, `django/conf/__init__.py` provides context on how settings are managed and could be relevant for a broader fix if settings management is implicated in the cleansing issue.\n\nGiven these steps, the identified code spans directly relate to the reported issue and provide the necessary context to work on a solution.",

This is directly in line with the reported issue, which points out the inadequacy of the current implementation regarding various types of iterables. The provided file context includes the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class with its `cleanse_setting` method and `get_safe_settings` method, which closely relate to the issue at hand. However, the current implementation only recursively handles dictionaries, and does not address the issue of other iterable types that need to be cleansed. Therefore, while the relevant class and method are present in the file context, the specific enhancement needed is not implemented, suggesting that the file context, although relevant, is not complete in addressing the reported issue.",

This could involve adding additional checks for `isinstance(value, list)` and similar for other iterable types, and recursively applying the cleansing logic to each element within these iterables. Additionally, ensure that this new logic does not disrupt the existing functionality for dictionaries."
