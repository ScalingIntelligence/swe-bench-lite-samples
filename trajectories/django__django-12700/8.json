The focus is on enhancing the `cleanse_setting` method to handle other types of iterables beyond just `dict`s. From the search results, the **django/views/debug.py** contains the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class with the `get_safe_settings` method that is directly related to the issue. Specifically, the `get_safe_settings` method iterates over the settings and applies `cleanse_setting` to each. This method is likely where the enhancement to handle iterables is needed. The **django/conf/__init__.py** file is also relevant as it defines the `LazySettings` and `Settings` classes which handle the settings module. This is a broader context needed to understand how settings are managed and why enhancements in `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` could be beneficial. The **django/utils/hashable.py** file is less relevant as it deals with making objects hashable, not with setting cleansing.",

Specifically, it points out that the current implementation of cleanse_setting() only handles dictionaries but does not account for other types of iterables, such as lists. This oversight causes sensitive information to be returned in its original form, potentially leading to security risks. \n\nGiven the existing context, we have identified two main components in the file_context: the SafeExceptionReporterFilter class and its method get_safe_settings(). The get_safe_settings() method iterates over the settings and applies the cleanse_setting() method to each. However, the cleanse_setting() method, as described in the issue, only processes dictionaries and doesn't handle other iterable types.\n\nThe new search results contain the SafeExceptionReporterFilter class again, focusing on the cleanse_setting() method. This method currently processes only dictionaries and returns other types as they are. This matches the issue's description about the insufficient cleaning of settings for types other than dictionaries. \n\nBased on these observations, the relevant code spans are located in the cleanse_setting() method of the SafeExceptionReporterFilter class in the django/views/debug.py file. These spans are crucial for addressing the issue of insufficient settings cleaning for non-dictionary iterable types.",
