  "initial_message": "Settings are cleaned insufficiently.\nDescription\n\t\nPosting publicly after checking with the rest of the security team.\nI just ran into a case where django.views.debug.SafeExceptionReporterFilter.get_safe_settings() would return several un-cleansed values. Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we \u200bonly take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but \u200breturn them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n"
