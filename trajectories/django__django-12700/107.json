Specifically, it points out that cleanse_setting() only handles dictionaries and fails to account for other types of iterables. This oversight results in un-cleansed values being returned, exposing sensitive information. The issue provides examples in settings.py demonstrating nested dictionaries and lists that are not properly cleansed. I have reviewed the search results and identified the relevant code spans within the SafeExceptionReporterFilter class in django/views/debug.py, notably the cleanse_setting() and get_safe_settings() methods. These methods are central to the function of cleansing settings and are directly impacted by the reported issue. They need to be updated to handle all types of iterables appropriately, ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed. This aligns with the request in the reported issue to adapt cleanse_setting() for handling non-dictionary iterables.",
