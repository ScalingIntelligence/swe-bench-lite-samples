There are specific cases mentioned where the function fails to raise an error for equations with infinite solutions. Given the code spans in the search results, it becomes crucial to identify which spans contain the logic for handling polynomial systems and detecting infinite solutions. By examining each code span in context, we can pinpoint the relevant sections that must be modified or extended to address the issue. Four key spans have been identified as relevant: `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` spans for `solve_poly_system`, `solve_generic`, and `solve_bias`, and the `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` span for `_solve_system`. These spans encapsulate the core logic for solving polynomial systems and handling exceptions, thus directly correspond to the issue at hand. Observing the `solve_poly_system` and `solve_generic` functions shaped a lot like bug patches or places where exceptions should be properly caught and handle to avoid the current behavior noticed.",
