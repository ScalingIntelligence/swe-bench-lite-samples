The provided code snippet indicates an unexpected behavior where a system with infinite solutions is not handled correctly, leading to a false positive result of `[(1,)]` instead of raising a `NotImplementedError`. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code where the infinite solution detection logic resides. The search results include the complete implementation of `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions, which are critical for understanding how the system of polynomial equations is solved and how infinite solutions might be detected. Additionally, the `_solve_reduced_system` function contains the logic for checking zero-dimensional systems and raising the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. Based on the issue description, the relevant code spans are those that handle the detection of zero-dimensional systems and the raising of the `NotImplementedError` when an infinite solution is detected. These spans include the entire `solve_poly_system` function, the `_solve_reduced_system` function, and the `raise NotImplementedError` statement within `_solve_reduced_system`. This ensures that we have all the necessary context to address the issue effectively. Since the search results include all the relevant functions and the specific error raising logic, the task is complete.",
