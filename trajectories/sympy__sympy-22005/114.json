The search results include significant parts of the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file, which contains the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions. These functions are critical for solving polynomial systems and handle different cases of polynomial systems. The `_solve_reduced_system` function, which raises the `NotImplementedError` for infinite solutions, is particularly relevant. The search results also include the `solve_biquadratic` function, which is used for handling biquadratic systems. This function checks for ground bases and handles the roots extraction, which is indirectly related to the issue of infinite solutions. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that deal directly with the handling of polynomial systems and the exceptions for unsupported cases like infinite solutions.",
