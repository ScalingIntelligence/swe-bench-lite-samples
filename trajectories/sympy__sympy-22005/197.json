From the provided search results, the `solve_poly_system` function, along with `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`, are analyzed to identify relevant code spans that can be used to address the issue. The focus is on improving the detection of infinite solution systems, particularly when the system is not zero-dimensional. The relevant code spans include the main `solve_poly_system` function, the `solve_generic` function where the univariate check is done, and the specific lines where a `NotImplementedError` is raised for non-zero-dimensional systems. These parts of the code are critical for understanding how to handle infinite solution scenarios and are essential for implementing the necessary changes to properly raise an error in such cases. Overall, the provided code won't fully solve the issue without additional logic to detect infinite solutions across the system generically.
