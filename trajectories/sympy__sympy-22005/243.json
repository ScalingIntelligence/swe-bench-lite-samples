The provided search results contain several key functions and sections that are relevant to solving polynomial systems: `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. Among these, the `solve_generic` function is particularly relevant as it handles the generic case of solving polynomial systems, which includes the detection of zero-dimensional systems. The specific issue mentioned involves the handling of infinite solutions, which is likely to be addressed in the sections dealing with the computation of roots and the handling of systems with non-ground basis. The `_solve_reduced_system` function within `solve_generic` throws a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems, which aligns with the issue being reported. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those dealing with the exception handling for non-zero-dimensional systems and the computation of roots in the `solve_generic` function.",
