The provided search results include several key functions: `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The issue appears to be related to the handling of univariate and multivariate polynomial systems, specifically where an infinite number of solutions could be possible but are not currently handled correctly. The `solve_poly_system` function is the entry point for solving polynomial systems, and it delegates to `solve_biquadratic` or `solve_generic` based on the system's characteristics. The `solve_generic` function contains the logic for solving general polynomial systems, including the detection of zero-dimensional systems (finite solutions). The function `_solve_reduced_system` within `solve_generic` is of particular interest as it raises the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems, which aligns with the issue reported. The code spans involving `solve_poly_system`, `solve_generic`, and specifically the `_solve_reduced_system` function should be considered relevant to address the reported issue.",
