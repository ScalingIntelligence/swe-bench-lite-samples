The provided code hint suggests modifying the existing code to handle this case better. Specifically, the code should raise a NotImplementedError when it encounters a system with an infinite number of solutions. In the search results, the solve_poly_system function is found which is responsible for solving polynomial systems. The solve_generic function is also found, which processes the polynomial systems and checks for univariate bases. The _solve_reduced_system function within solve_generic is the one where the NotImplementedError is raised for systems that are not zero-dimensional. This function should be further examined to ensure it correctly identifies and handles systems with infinite solutions as specified in the issue. Both the solve_poly_system and solve_generic functions are relevant as they are central to the solving process. The code spans within these functions should be analyzed to find the exact sections that need modification to properly handle the infinite solution scenario.",
