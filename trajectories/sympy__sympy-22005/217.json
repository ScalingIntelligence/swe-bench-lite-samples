Additionally, the code snippet provided in the diff suggests that the infinite solution detection logic should be implemented in solve_poly_system.

Within `_solve_reduced_system`, the function raises a `NotImplementedError` for cases where the system is not zero-dimensional, which implies that it does not support infinite solutions. This indicates a clear area for improvement to handle infinite solutions appropriately. Given the complexity of detecting infinite solutions in polynomial systems, it's essential to add checks that can identify such scenarios based on the properties of the polynomials, such as the degree of the polynomials or the nature of the Groebner basis. Modifications could include enhancing the logic within `_solve_reduced_system` to detect infinite solution cases and raise a distinct error or return a specific result that indicates an infinite number of solutions instead of falling back to the `NotImplementedError`. It would also be beneficial to consult any theoretical documentation or guidelines within the project or from the field of polynomial system solving to ensure the detection logic aligns with best practices or established algorithms.",
