The current code does not handle this correctly and returns a solution instead. The provided search results contain the `solve_poly_system` and related functions where the modifications seem to be necessary to catch such cases. Specifically, the function `_solve_reduced_system` needs to be checked and possibly modified to ensure it raises the appropriate error for infinite solutions instead of returning a finite solution. The identified code spans include the `solve_poly_system` function itself and the `solve_generic` function where the error handling logic resides. These are the key areas where the error should be implemented or corrected to adhere to the reported issue.",
