The `solve_generic` function includes the logic for solving polynomial systems, including a check for zero-dimensional systems. The `_solve_reduced_system` function within `solve_generic` raises a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems, which aligns with the issue description. Additionally, the `solve_biquadratic` function is related to solving biquadratic equations, which is a specific case of polynomial systems and could potentially handle or encounter infinite solutions.
