The user provided a specific example where `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly, and a suggestion for a fix in the `_solve_reduced_system` function. The search results contain several relevant files and functions such as `solve_poly_system` in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, `_solve_reduced_system` in `sympy/solvers/solvers.py`, and tests in `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py`. These are directly related to the issue as they involve the function used in the example and the code that handles polynomial systems. The issue requires a fix in the `_solve_reduced_system` function to adjust the condition for univariate polynomial check, and additional tests to ensure the fix works. Therefore, the relevant code spans in the search results are those that involve `solve_poly_system` and the related solving functions.",
