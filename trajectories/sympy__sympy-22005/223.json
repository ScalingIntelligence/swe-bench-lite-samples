These functions are critical as they encapsulate the process of solving polynomial equations and determining the nature of their solutions. The key parts to examine are how these functions handle cases where the polynomial system might have an infinite number of solutions, such as when the system is not zero-dimensional. From the diff provided in the issue, it's evident that modifications are needed in _solve_reduced_system to properly handle certain edge cases, likely involving single-variable equations (as hinted by the use of 'univariate' in the code).
