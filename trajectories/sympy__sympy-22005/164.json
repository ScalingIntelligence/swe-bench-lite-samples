Specifically, the issue points out that certain cases are not handled correctly, leading to incorrect results when an infinite number of solutions exist. The provided search results include several functions that are likely relevant to solving this issue. The solve_poly_system function describes the main entry point for solving polynomial systems, which aligns with the issue's description. Additionally, the solve_biquadratic and solve_generic functions contain detailed logic for handling specific types of polynomial systems. Particularly relevant is the solve_generic function, which includes a check for univariate systems and raises a NotImplementedError for non-zero-dimensional systems, which seems to be the focus of the issue. This function also includes calls to helper functions like _is_univariate and _solve_reduced_system, which further refine the solution process for polynomial systems. Based on the alignment of these functions with the description of the issue, it is concluded that these code spans are relevant to addressing the infinite solution detection issue.",

In the `solve_generic` function, the `_solve_reduced_system` method is defined and includes a check for univariate equations. However, the current implementation only raises a `NotImplementedError` for systems that do not meet the criteria for finite solutions. The specific issue regarding the detection of infinite solutions (as described in the documentation error output) requires a modification to handle one-dimensional systems correctly, particularly those that should not be trivially solved. The file context's current state does not appear to include the specific enhancement needed to handle one-dimensional systems for non-trivial cases without raising a `NotImplementedError`. However, the file context has identified the relevant function (`solve_poly_system`) and the place in the code (`_solve_reduced_system`) where modifications need to be made, suggesting that the primary area of focus for the reported issue is indeed present. It seems plausible that completing the task would involve modifying the conditional checks within `_solve_reduced_system` to better handle one-dimensional systems.",
