The traceback indicates that the function currently only supports zero-dimensional systems (finite number of solutions). To address this, we need to identify where the infinite solution detection logic should be placed within the system. Based on the file context, it's likely that modifications would occur within `polysys.py`. We should also review how the function handles different polynomial systems and ensure that it can properly identify infinite solution scenarios.",

These functions are central to the system's equation-solving capabilities and directly related to the reported issue, particularly in how they handle systems of polynomial equations and the detection of finite solutions. The functions `solve_poly_system` and `solve_generic` contain logic that raises a `NotImplementedError` for systems without a finite number of solutions, which aligns with the issue description.
