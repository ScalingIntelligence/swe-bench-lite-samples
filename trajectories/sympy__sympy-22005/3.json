The example provided shows that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly, where it should raise `NotImplementedError` but instead returns `[(1,)]`. This suggests a need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the conditions for infinite solutions or incorrectly return solutions for infinite systems. The current context is empty, indicating no previous relevant files or code spans have been identified. The search results include three code spans: 'solve_poly_system', 'solve_biquadratic', and 'solve_generic'. Within 'solve_generic', there is a specific section dealing with conditions for univariate systems and raising `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. This section appears relevant to the reported issue as it deals with the detection of non-finite solutions. Therefore, the identified relevant code spans are from the 'solve_generic' function, which includes the logic to handle and raise errors for infinite systems.",
