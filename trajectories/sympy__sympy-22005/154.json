The provided traceback and tests show that the system is not handling cases like `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` correctly, as it should raise a `NotImplementedError` instead of returning a finite solution. Examining the existing code, we see the `solve_poly_system` function in `polysys.py`, which includes calls to `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`. Both of these functions use Groebner basis and root-finding methods that assume finite solutions. Given the issue, the key change needed is to update the `_solve_reduced_system` function to correctly handle the case for single-variable but multi-dimensional systems, which is the essence of ensuring an infinite solution detection. The revised code is already partially applied, with a modified condition (`if len(univariate) == 1 and len(gens) == 1`) in the provided diff that was not found in the search results. This condition suggests the logic needed to distinguish between cases of one univariate polynomial and when the system is still considered multi-dimensional. Therefore, to address this issue, the following actions are necessary: apply the condition to determine whether the system is genuinely 0-dimensional or has an infinite number of solutions, and ensure all exceptions for unsupported infinite-dimensional systems are aligned with this condition.",
