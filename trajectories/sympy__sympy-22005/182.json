Specifically, it points out that the system is not handled correctly when it should raise a `NotImplementedError` for cases that correspond to infinite solutions. From the provided git diff, it appears that the focus is on modifying the `_solve_reduced_system` function to correctly identify and handle these cases. \n\nIn the search results, the `_solve_reduced_system` function is found within the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file. This function contains the logic for solving polynomial systems and includes a check for univariate polynomials. The code span where this check occurs seems relevant to the reported issue as it is likely where the modification needs to be made to correctly handle infinite solution cases. \n\nThe existing condition `if len(univariate) == 1:` is part of the logic that currently raises a `NotImplementedError` if the system is not zero-dimensional. The proposed change in the git diff refines this condition to `if len(univariate) == 1 and len(gens) == 1:`, which suggests that the additional condition `len(gens) == 1` is intended to catch cases that would otherwise result in infinite solutions. It's likely that refining this condition within the `_solve_reduced_system` function will address the reported issue.",
