The example provided shows that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly, as it does not raise the expected `NotImplementedError`. This suggests that the function should be updated to handle such cases appropriately. Specifically, we need to ensure that if the system has an infinite number of solutions, it should raise an error instead of returning an incorrect result. In the provided search results, the `solve_poly_system` function and related helper functions (`solve_biquadratic`, `solve_generic`) are identified. These functions handle the solving of polynomial systems, including the identification of univariate polynomials and the determination of solutions based on various conditions. The current implementation seems to check for zero-dimensional systems (finite number of solutions) using the Groebner basis and univariate polynomial checks. The code spans for `solve_poly_system` and `solve_generic` are relevant as they directly involve the processing and solving of polynomial systems. The `_solve_reduced_system` function within `solve_generic` also raises the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems, which aligns with the issue reported. Thus, these code spans are relevant for addressing the reported issue.",

Specifically, the issue points out that the system `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly, returning `[(1,)]` instead of raising a `NotImplementedError`. The diff suggests modifications to the `_solve_reduced_system` function to address this.\n2. The current file context provided is the `polysys.py` file that contains the `solve_poly_system` function and other related functions like `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`.\n3. The new search results include code spans from `solvers.py`, `solveset.py`, `inequalities.py`, and additional spans from `polysys.py`.\n4. Relevance analysis:\n   - `polysys.py` (span id='solve_generic'): This contains the `solve_generic` function which is directly related to solving polynomial systems and includes the `_solve_reduced_system` function where the issue might be addressed.\n   - `solvers.py` (span id='solve'): This function is a general solver and might be relevant but less directly related to the specific issue at hand.\n   - `solveset.py` (span id='solveset'): This is part of the solveset module, which might handle solution sets differently. It's related to solving but indirectly for this specific issue.\n   - `inequalities.py` (span id='solve_univariate_inequality'): Not directly related to solving polynomial systems.\n5. From the `polysys.py` spans, the `solve_generic` function and its nested `_solve_reduced_system` function are the most relevant for this issue, especially as they pertain to handling zero-dimensional systems and raising `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. The suggested changes in the diff likely need to be applied in the `_solve_reduced_system` function.\n",
