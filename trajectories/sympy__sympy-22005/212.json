We also see a diff suggesting changes to handle the case of infinite solutions correctly. From the search results, we should look at the functions `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` to identify where the current handling might be insufficient or incorrect. The function `solve_generic` contains the `_solve_reduced_system` method, which is mentioned in the diff as well, and it raises the NotImplementedError for 'only zero-dimensional systems supported'. Therefore, the relevant parts of the codebase for addressing the issue are primarily within these functions and the specific condition checks related to univariate polynomials and zero-dimensional systems.",
