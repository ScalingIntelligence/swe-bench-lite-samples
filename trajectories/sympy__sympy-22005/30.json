Specifically, the system `(y - 1, x) = 0` is not handled correctly, and instead of raising an error or properly handling the infinite solutions case, it returns `[(1,)]` which is incorrect. From the search results, we need to identify sections that relate to solving polynomial systems, specifically those that involve handling singular or underdetermined systems. \n\nFrom the provided search results, the functions `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` are relevant. Within `solve_generic`, the function `_solve_reduced_system` is crucial for identifying and handling systems that might have zero or infinite solutions. The span containing the `NotImplementedError` exception in `_solve_reduced_system` is particularly relevant as it points to the current limitation where only zero-dimensional systems (those with a finite number of solutions) are supported. This matches the reported issue where the system should detect and handle cases with infinite solutions. Therefore, the main areas of interest are in the detection and handling of these cases within the functions `solve_poly_system` and `_solve_reduced_system`.",
