The error indicates that the system only supports zero-dimensional systems with a finite number of solutions, but an infinite solution scenario in a specific case is not being handled correctly. The provided search results include significant functions and logic related to polynomial system solving, such as `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. These functions are directly involved in the solving process of polynomial systems and their handling of different dimensions and types of solutions. Specifically, the `solve_generic` function includes a check for univariate polynomials and raises a `NotImplementedError` for systems that are not zero-dimensional. This is relevant to the reported issue because it indicates where the error might be originating from. There's also a modification suggestion in the issue for `_solve_reduced_system` that hints at the need to check the number of generators to handle specific cases better. Based on these considerations, the relevant code spans include the main function `solve_poly_system`, the specific handling in `solve_generic` for generic systems, and the modification point in `_solve_reduced_system` where the error is thrown. These spans collectively represent the core logic and potential issue locations in the handling of polynomial systems.",
