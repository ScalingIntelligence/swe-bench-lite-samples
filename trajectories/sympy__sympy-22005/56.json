The code spans in `solve_poly_system` need to be examined to understand how the function processes different types of systems, including univariate and multivariate systems. Additionally, the test cases in `test_polysys.py` need to be inspected to ensure that the handling of infinite solutions is properly tested and that the function raises `NotImplementedError` for systems with infinite solutions as expected.

The user provided a traceback indicating that the system should raise a `NotImplementedError` for systems with an infinite number of solutions, but it is not handled correctly in some cases, as demonstrated by the example where the system `(y - 1,), x, y` does not raise the error. I examined the current context and identified the relevant function `solve_poly_system` which is defined in the provided code. The issue seems to involve the handling of systems that are not zero-dimensional (i.e., those with an infinite number of solutions). The provided diff indicates that the condition for raising the `NotImplementedError` should be adjusted to account for systems with multiple variables. I then reviewed the new search results to find any additional relevant code spans but found that they mostly contained related function imports and other solver functions. Based on the analysis, the identified file and spans should be sufficient to address the issue at hand.",
