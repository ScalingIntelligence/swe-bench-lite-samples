The traceback indicates that only zero-dimensional systems are supported, implying a finite number of solutions. The example provided shows that for a univariate system (y - 1,), the function does not handle the case where there should be an infinite number of solutions correctly. The proposed fix in the diff is to modify the condition in _solve_reduced_system to explicitly handle the case where there is one univariate polynomial and one generator. This ensures that the system is restricted to zero-dimensional cases. The search results provided include the solve_poly_system function and related helper functions such as solve_biquadratic and solve_generic, which are likely relevant for addressing the issue, as they deal with solving polynomial systems of equations. Specifically, the _solve_reduced_system function, where the NotImplementedError is raised for non-zero-dimensional systems, is identified as the key piece of code to focus on to implement the proposed fix.",
