The provided patch suggests modifications to the existing code to better handle such cases, including raising a `NotImplementedError` for such scenarios. The new search results contain several relevant functions and modules. Notably, the `solve_poly_system` function in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` directly relates to the issue, as it is responsible for solving polynomial systems. The modifications proposed in the patch are supported by tests in `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py`. The `_solve_reduced_system` function within the `solve_poly_system` function is the main focus, as it identifies and manages univariate polynomials. Reviewing the entire sections of code around `_solve_reduced_system` is crucial to ensure that the context includes all related logic for identifying singular and univariate cases, which are key to handling infinite solution sets.
