The error trace indicates that while the system is supposed to raise a NotImplementedError for systems with a finite number of solutions, the test case shows it is not handled correctly for certain cases, specifically when trying to solve for a system that includes a polynomial (y - 1) with variables x and y. The proposed solution in the diff is to modify the condition in the function _solve_reduced_system to handle cases where the length of univariate equals 1 and the length of gens equals 1. In the search results, the function solve_poly_system and the helper function _solve_reduced_system are found, which are directly related to solving polynomial systems. The function _solve_reduced_system already contains a condition that raises the NotImplementedError for systems with a finite number of solutions, likely where the modification should occur. Additionally, the function solve_biquadratic is present but doesn't appear to be directly related to the issue, as it deals with a specific case of biquadratic equations.",
