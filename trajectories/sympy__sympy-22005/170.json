These are relevant to addressing the issue as they may contain logic or auxiliary functions used directly or indirectly by `solve_poly_system`.\n\nWhile the spans around `solve_poly_system`, `checksol`, and `nsolve` could be relevant to fixing the infinite solution issue, more specifically, spans in `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` labeled 'solve', 'checksol', and 'nsolve' may directly relate to functionalities fundamental to handling such issues.
