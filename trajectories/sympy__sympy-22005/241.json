Specifically, it points out that the function does not handle correctly the case where a system has an infinite number of solutions. The provided example shows that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` should raise a `NotImplementedError` but instead returns `[(1,)]`. The task is to identify relevant code spans in the search results that address this issue.\n\nUpon examining the search results, we find several relevant code spans:\n\n1. The `solve_poly_system` function (span id 'solve_poly_system') is responsible for solving polynomial systems. It is where the initial handling of the polynomial systems occurs. This function should be able to detect and handle cases with infinite solutions appropriately.\n\n2. The `solve_generic` function (span id 'solve_generic') contains the `_solve_reduced_system` function which is used to solve reduced systems of polynomials. Inside `_solve_reduced_system`, there is a check for univariate polynomials and a `NotImplementedError` is raised for non-zero-dimensional systems (i.e., systems with infinite solutions). This is relevant because it directly addresses the issue of infinite solutions.\n\n3. The `solve_biquadratic` function (span id 'solve_biquadratic') is used for solving biquadratic equations, but it does not directly handle the specific issue of infinite solutions. However, it is part of the broader system and could potentially be involved if the polynomial system is reduced to a biquadratic form.\n\nGiven these points, the most relevant code spans for addressing the reported issue are those within the `solve_poly_system` and `solve_generic` functions.",
