The specific case mentioned involves the system `(y - 1, x, y)`, which currently returns `[(1,)]` instead of raising a `NotImplementedError`. This indicates that the function does not properly handle systems with infinitely many solutions. The provided search results include relevant code spans in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, specifically the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions. The `solve_poly_system` function is the entry point for solving polynomial systems, and it delegates the solving process to `solve_biquadratic` or `solve_generic` based on the characteristics of the system. The `solve_generic` function is particularly relevant, as it contains the `_solve_reduced_system` method, which includes the check for univariate polynomials and raises the `NotImplementedError` for systems not supported. Identifying the relevant code spans will help in understanding and potentially modifying this logic to correctly handle infinite solutions.",
