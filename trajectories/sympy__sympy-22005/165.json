The provided search results include the `solve_poly_system` function and related functions like `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`. \n\nThe main concern is ensuring that systems with an infinite number of solutions, like the example (`Poly(y - 1, x, y)`), are correctly identified and handled. This involves examining the logic within `solve_poly_system` and the helper functions it calls. Specifically, we should look at how the system of polynomials is processed, and how univariate polynomial checks are managed, especially where it might lead to infinite solutions. \n\nThe code spans in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` that are relevant include:\n1. The `solve_poly_system` function that initializes the system.\n2. The `solve_generic` function that handles the bulk of the solution process, including the invocation of the Groebner basis and the univariate polynomial check. The univariate check is crucial as it influences whether the system proceeds under the assumption of finite solutions only.\n3. The `_solve_reduced_system` function, which contains the logic that raises a `NotImplementedError` for systems not supported for finite solutions. This is where the relevant change was suggested in the diff (adding an additional condition `len(gens) == 1`).\n\nThese sections of code are critical for understanding and possibly modifying to ensure the correct handling of infinite solution cases.",
