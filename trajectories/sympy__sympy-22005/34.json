The traceback indicates that the system is designed to support only zero-dimensional systems, implying a finite number of solutions. However, the provided example shows that the function incorrectly handles the case where an infinite solution is possible, specifically with the equations (y - 1,) for variables x and y. It is crucial to identify the function that handles such cases and to ensure it raises the correct error for infinite solutions. The files provided suggest that `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` is likely to contain the relevant code. Additionally, `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py` should be checked for test cases that may not be correctly asserting the error handling for infinite solutions.",
