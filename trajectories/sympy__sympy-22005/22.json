The primary target is to identify code that deals with polynomial systems and the detection of infinite solutions. The provided search results include functions such as `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The `solve_poly_system` function is directly related to the solving of polynomial systems, which is the main focus of the issue. Within `solve_poly_system`, there is a direct reference to the implementation of handling bivariate quadratic systems, which might also be relevant if they can handle or interact with infinite solutions. The `solve_generic` function includes a section where it raises a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems, directly relevant to the reported issue of handling infinite solutions. I selected the span `solve_poly_system` for detailed examination due to its direct relevance and potential impact on the reported issue. Additionally, considering the complexity and the need to review the handling of polynomial systems as a whole, I included the `solve_generic` span for a broader understanding of how the system might currently handle or fail to handle infinite solutions. This approach ensures that we inspect the most relevant sections of the codebase that are directly implicated in the solution and error handling of polynomial systems.",
