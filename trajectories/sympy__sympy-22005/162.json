Specifically, the provided example shows the function not behaving as expected when given the polynomial (y - 1, x, y). Step-by-step analysis: 1. Review the existing implementation of `solve_poly_system` and its helper functions to understand how the function processes input systems and determines the dimensionality of the solution space. 2. Identify where the logic for detecting infinite solution scenarios might be lacking or incorrect. 3. Since the provided diff suggests modifications in `_solve_reduced_system`, focus on understanding this function's role and how it might be improved to cover the reported case. 4. The code spans in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` include critical elements like `_solve_reduced_system`, `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. These are relevant because they directly deal with solving polynomial systems and could be modified to improve handling of infinite solution scenarios. 5. The most relevant code spans are those where the logic for detecting and handling infinite solutions is implemented or should be implemented (like `_solve_reduced_system` and possibly `solve_poly_system`). 6. Note that the suggested changes in the diff involve checking if the length of `univariate` is 1 and the number of `gens` is 1, which seems to be the focus area for handling infinte solutions effectively.",
