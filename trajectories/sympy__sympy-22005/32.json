The error indicates that only zero-dimensional systems (finite number of solutions) are supported, but the system fails to correctly handle certain cases, such as a single polynomial with two variables. The provided file context points to several files in the sympy.solvers package, which might be relevant. The 'polysys.py' file contains the core functionality of solving polynomial systems. The 'solvers.py' and 'solveset.py' files contain general solvers and set solvers, respectively. Other files like 'solvers.py', 'pde.py', and 'bivariate.py' might also be relevant as they handle different types of equations and systems. It's necessary to inspect the 'solve_poly_system' function in 'polysys.py' to identify where the detection of infinite solutions is not handled correctly and where the change (modifying the condition on line 240) needs to be implemented.",
