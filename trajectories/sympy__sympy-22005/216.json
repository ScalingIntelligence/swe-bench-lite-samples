The provided code spans from `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` include the `solve_poly_system` function and related helper functions such as `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`. These functions handle the solving of polynomial systems but seem to lack specific checks for infinite solutions when the system is not zero-dimensional. The analysis of these code spans indicates that the relevant sections are those that handle the solving mechanism and raise the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems.
