The issue specifically points out that the case where a system is not zero-dimensional (infinite solutions) is not handled correctly. The relevant code spans involve the `solve_poly_system` function itself and the `solve_generic` function, particularly the `_solve_reduced_system` method where the `NotImplementedError` is raised for non-zero-dimensional systems. The provided diff in the issue also suggests modifications to handle these cases explicitly by checking the number of generators.
