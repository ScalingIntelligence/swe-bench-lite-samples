I examined the search results in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, where the function `solve_poly_system` and related sub-functions like `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic` are defined. The `solve_generic` function contains the logic for solving polynomial systems and uses a Groebner basis to handle different cases. \n\nThe specific code span in `solve_generic` that deals with univariate systems and raises a `NotImplementedError` when systems are not zero-dimensional (finite) is relevant to the reported issue. This span is responsible for handling cases where the system has an infinite number of solutions, which aligns with the issue description. The presence of the NotImplementedError in the code suggests that the system is aware of the limitation regarding infinite solutions and intends to address it in the future.\n\nThe relevant code spans are those within the `solve_generic` function that check for univariate systems and either solve them or raise the `NotImplementedError`. These spans can guide the implementation of proper handling for infinite solutions as reported in the issue.",
