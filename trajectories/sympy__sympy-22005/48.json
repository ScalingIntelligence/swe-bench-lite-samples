The example provided shows that the system is not handling the case where one of the polynomials in the system is univariate in one variable but not in the others (leading to potentially infinite solutions). The suggested patch includes changes to the _solve_reduced_system function to raise a NotImplementedError when the system size is not zero-dimensional. This suggests that we need to find the relevant parts of the code where the system dimension is checked and where polynomials are being processed to ensure that if a system is not zero-dimensional, an appropriate error is raised. In the provided search results, we find the functions solve_poly_system, solve_biquadratic, and solve_generic, which contain the relevant logic for solving polynomial systems and checking the dimensions. The span with id 'solve_poly_system' contains the top-level function that attempts to solve the polynomial system. The span with id 'solve_biquadratic' deals with solving bi-quadratic systems and checks the conditions for zero-dimensional systems. The span with id 'solve_generic' contains the _solve_reduced_system function, which is where the main logic for solving the system lies and where the system dimension is checked to ensure it is zero-dimensional. These spans are relevant because they contain the logic for solving polynomial systems and the checks for system dimensions, which directly relate to the reported issue. A key part is the _solve_reduced_system function, where the system dimension is checked and an error is raised if it's not zero-dimensional.",
