Within `solve_generic`, the `_solve_reduced_system` function checks for univariate systems and raises a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. The proposed change in the issue's diff correctly addresses the requirement by modifying the univariate check condition to add an additional condition for handling systems with only one variable correctly. This context aligns with the reported issue, suggesting that the infinite solution detection can be optimized in the same area of the code. Additionally, the test cases added in the issue's diff confirm the points of failure and the need for improvement, ensuring that the solution will correctly raise errors for dimensions resulting in infinite solutions. Therefore, the provided file context seems comprehensive for addressing the issue, incorporating both the necessary function modifications and the corresponding test cases.",
