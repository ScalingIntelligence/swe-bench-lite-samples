The primary function of interest is `solve_poly_system` which is responsible for solving polynomial systems. The relevant code spans include the definition of `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. These functions handle the main logic for solving polynomial systems, including the detection of cases that are not zero-dimensional (finite solutions). The code spans identified here are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue of handling infinite solution cases. Specifically, the modification in the diff to `_solve_reduced_system` suggests a potential place to address the issue by adding a condition to handle systems with more variables than equations.",
