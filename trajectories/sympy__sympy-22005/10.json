The focus seems to be on the `solve_poly_system` function, particularly in the handling of univariate cases. Additionally, there are potential improvements in the test cases to ensure that these edge cases are properly covered. The provided search results include several key functions: `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, which includes `_solve_reduced_system`. These functions are central to the solving of polynomial systems and directly relate to the issue at hand. The code spans in these functions need to be reviewed to ensure they correctly handle and raise errors for systems with infinite solutions, such as those involving single variable polynomials with multiple generators. The relevant code spans from these functions will be identified as potentially needing modifications to address the reported issue.",
