The `solve_poly_system` function is the entry point for solving polynomial systems, and it delegates to `solve_biquadratic` or `solve_generic` based on the characteristics of the input polynomials. The `solve_generic` function contains the logic for solving zero-dimensional polynomial systems, which includes the handling of univariate polynomials and the rejection of systems that are not zero-dimensional. This is relevant because the issue might involve extending the functionality to handle cases where infinite solutions are possible. Thus, these spans are directly related to the reported issue as they deal with the core polynomial solving mechanisms.",
