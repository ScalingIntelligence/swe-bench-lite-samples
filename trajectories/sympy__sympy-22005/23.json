These functions are involved in solving polynomial systems and handling specific cases like bivariate quadratic systems. Given the context of the issue, the focus should be on how these functions handle systems that do not have a finite number of solutions. The `solve_generic` function contains the `_solve_reduced_system` method, which raises a `NotImplementedError` for systems that are not zero-dimensional (finite solutions). This appears to be the core logic that needs to address the issue of infinite solutions. Additionally, the code spans in `solve_poly_system` and `solve_biquadratic` are also relevant as they set up the system and handle specific types of polynomial systems, respectively.",
