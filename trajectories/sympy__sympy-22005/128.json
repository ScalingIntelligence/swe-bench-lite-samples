The provided example shows that for a univariate system like `(y - 1,), x, y`, the function does not handle it correctly and returns a solution where it should raise a `NotImplementedError`. The new search results show the implementation of `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions in `polysys.py`. The most relevant code spans are those that handle the solving of polynomial systems, including the `_solve_reduced_system` function which raises the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. This directly addresses the issue by identifying the part of the code that needs to be improved to correctly handle such cases. The other functions, `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`, provide context on how the system currently handles different types of polynomial systems, but they do not directly relate to the reported issue of infinite solutions. Therefore, the focus should be on improving the `_solve_reduced_system` function to correctly identify and handle infinite solution cases.",
