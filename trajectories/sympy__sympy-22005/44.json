The provided search results contain several key functions: 'solve_poly_system', 'solve_biquadratic', and 'solve_generic'. These functions are crucial for solving polynomial systems and are directly related to the issue. 'solve_poly_system' is the main function that orchestrates the solving process, deciding which solver (like 'solve_biquadratic') to use based on the system's characteristics. 'solve_generic' contains the '_solve_reduced_system' function, which is where the issue of handling infinite solutions is likely to be addressed as per the suggested code diff. The function 'groebner' is also critical as it provides the basis for solving the polynomial system. Given this, the relevant code spans are those that deal directly with solving polynomial systems and handling cases where the system might have infinite solutions, which are 'solve_poly_system', '_solve_reduced_system', and possibly the modifications within 'solve_biquadratic' if any specific handling is added for bivariate systems leading to infinite solutions.",
