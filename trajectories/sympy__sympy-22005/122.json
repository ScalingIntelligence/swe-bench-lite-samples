The example provided demonstrates that the system does not correctly handle cases where the system of equations might have an infinite number of solutions. Specifically, the case `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` should raise a `NotImplementedError` but instead returns `[(1,)]`. The search results contain the `solve_poly_system` function, which is a key part of handling polynomial systems of equations. The function `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic` are also present, which handle specific types of polynomial systems and general polynomial systems, respectively. The function `_solve_reduced_system` is of particular interest as it includes code related to handling univariate polynomials and raising the `NotImplementedError` for systems that are not zero-dimensional. The diff provided in the issue is already suggesting a potential fix (adding a check for the number of generators) to the `_solve_reduced_system` function, which is also found in the search results.
