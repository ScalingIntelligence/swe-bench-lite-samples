The provided diff suggests modifications to the `_solve_reduced_system` function in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` to ensure that the system is zero-dimensional. The search results contain relevant functions such as `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and other related functions in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` and `sympy/solvers/solvers.py`. These functions are directly involved in solving polynomial systems and could be relevant for addressing the issue.
