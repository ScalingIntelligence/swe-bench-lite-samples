The `solve_poly_system` function is found in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, and it is imported and used in `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` and `sympy/solvers/solveset.py`. The issue suggests that the function should raise a `NotImplementedError` for certain cases, but it currently does not handle all such cases correctly. The relevant code spans include the definition of `solve_poly_system` and its usage in other parts of the codebase. Analyzing these spans indicates that the code responsible for handling polynomial systems and deciding when to raise the `NotImplementedError` needs to be reviewed and potentially adjusted. Additionally, the test cases provide further context on where the implementation might be failing and what needs to be addressed. By identifying these specific code spans, we can determine that the search results are relevant to the reported issue.",
