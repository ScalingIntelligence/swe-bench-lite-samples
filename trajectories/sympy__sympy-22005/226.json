The provided code context and search results offer insights into the existing `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions that are central to handling polynomial systems in SymPy. The challenge lies in detecting and raising an error when an infinite solution space is detected, which is not directly coded in the span examples provided. To solve this, detecting when the system becomes univariate while having multiple generators is pivotal. This is evidenced in the code snippet from sympy/solvers/polysys.py where a new check is proposed that if `len(univariate) == 1 and len(gens) > 1`, it would raise a `NotImplementedError`. This proposal directly addresses the issue by checking for potential infinite solution spaces in polynomial systems. The provided search results confirm the presence of crucial parts of the code such as the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions that can be further adapted to include the necessary checks to handle infinite solution scenarios. Thus, while the search results do not provide the exact code modifications needed, they guide towards where these modifications could be applied to effectively address the issue.",
