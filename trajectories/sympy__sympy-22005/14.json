We need to ensure that when a specific polynomial system is provided, the solver correctly identifies and handles cases with infinite solutions, raising a NotImplementedError as appropriate. From the provided context, it seems the focus should be on the `solve_poly_system` function and related methods in the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file. Additionally, there are test cases added which indicate that we should look for these specific cases in the code to ensure that they are indeed raising the expected errors. Given the example in the issue, the focus should be on configurations where the system of polynomials might yield infinite solutions, especially around the detection and handling of such cases.",

The modified code in the diff suggests that there should be a check for univariate systems and a specific condition to handle the case where the number of variables equals one. I will identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that pertain to this issue.\n\n1. The `solve_poly_system` function is identified as relevant because it is the main function for solving polynomial systems, which is where the issue arises.\n2. The `solve_biquadratic` function is related because it handles specific bivariate quadratic systems.\n3. The `solve_generic` function is essential because it contains the logic for solving generic polynomial systems, including the `_solve_reduced_system` function, which is where the NotImplementedError is raised for non-zero-dimensional systems.\n\nThe key spans to focus on are the ones that deal with the logic of checking for univariate systems and raising the NotImplementedError for non-zero-dimensional systems.",
