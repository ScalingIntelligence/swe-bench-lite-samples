The provided code snippet in the issue specifically points out that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly, suggesting it should raise a `NotImplementedError` but instead returns an incorrect result `[(1,)]`. Additionally, the diff indicates an attempt to restrict the condition when a `NotImplementedError` should be raised. The search results provide the complete context of the `solve_poly_system` function, including various helper functions and the initialization of the polynomial system solving process. The `_solve_reduced_system` function is particularly relevant, as it currently throws a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems, which aligns with the requirement from the issue. However, the current implementation does not properly handle the specific case outlined in the issue, where the system is not zero-dimensional and should therefore raise the exception. The provided code spans in the search results touch upon these areas and need to be evaluated based on this context.",
