The logic in `_solve_reduced_system` checks for the length of `univariate`, which aligns with the issue description that systems with an infinite number of solutions are not handled. The existing code handles the case where the length of `univariate` is one but does not check if the number of generators (`gens`) is also one, which is suggested by the issue and the patch as the point of error. The lack of handling for infinite solutions in the case where `len(univariate) == 1` and `len(gens) > 1` is evident from the code provided.
