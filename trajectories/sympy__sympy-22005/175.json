Specifically, the example `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly and should raise a `NotImplementedError` but instead returns a finite solution. This indicates a gap in the current implementation for handling infinite solutions. The provided context from `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` includes code spans for the `solve_poly_system` function, which attempts to solve polynomial systems and handles specific cases like biquadratic systems. The new search results include code spans from `sympy/polys/groebnertools.py` and `sympy/polys/polytools.py`. The `groebner` function in `groebnertools.py` is crucial for computing Groebner bases, which are essential for solving polynomial systems. The `groebner_lcm` function in the same file computes the least common multiple for Groebner bases. In `polytools.py`, the `groebner` function wraps the `GroebnerBasis` class, which is a higher-level abstraction for handling Groebner bases. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the handling of infinite solutions in relation to the computation of Groebner bases is crucial. The existing code spans suggest that the system only supports zero-dimensional systems (finite number of solutions), which aligns with the need to detect and handle infinite solution cases appropriately.",
