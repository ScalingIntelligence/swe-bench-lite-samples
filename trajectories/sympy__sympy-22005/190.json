Specifically, the `solve_poly_system` function is the entry point for solving polynomial systems, and it calls `solve_biquadratic` for bivariate quadratic systems and `solve_generic` for general systems. The `solve_generic` function includes a check for univariate systems and raises a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. This is directly related to the issue reported, as the current implementation does not handle infinite solutions correctly. The identified code spans are relevant to the issue because they provide the core logic for solving polynomial systems, which includes the handling of univariate systems and the generation of solutions.
