These functions collectively manage the solving of polynomial systems, including the detection and handling of infinite solutions.

The search results provide a deep dive into these functions, which are critical for understanding how the polynomial system is solved.

The issue involves handling situations where an infinite solution request is not handled correctly, as evident from the traceback and the diff indicating a new check for univariate and single-variable condition. I'll review the existing code to understand how `solve_poly_system` handles polynomial systems and identify any checks to detect infinite solutions.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` where the main function `solve_poly_system` and related functions like `solve_generic`, `solve_biquadratic`, and the internal function `_solve_reduced_system` are defined. These functions handle the solving of polynomial systems and might need adjustments to tackle infinite solutions.\n\nNext, I'll review the second file `sympy/solvers/solveset.py` where `solve_poly_system` is imported and used. This will help in understanding how the polynomial solver is integrated into the broader context of solving systems (could involve more complex logic with conditions, checks, etc).\n\nLastly, checking the other relevant files which use `solve_poly_system` or involve polynomial solving, such as `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` and `sympy/solvers/inequalities.py`, to ensure comprehensive understanding of the handling of polynomial systems within this codebase.\n\nWill determine relevance of each span based on how closely they are related to the reported issue of handling infinite solutions in polynomial systems.",
