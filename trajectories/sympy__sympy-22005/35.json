The example provided shows that the system is not handling the case where a polynomial system has an infinite number of solutions correctly. Specifically, the example `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` should not return `[(1,)]` but should raise a NotImplementedError indicating that the system cannot handle this case. \n\nAnalyzing the search results, we find functions like solve_poly_system, solve_biquadratic, and solve_generic which are directly related to solving polynomial systems. The solve_poly_system function is the entry point and delegates the task to solve_biquadratic or solve_generic based on the system's characteristics. The solve_generic function contains a part where it checks if the system is zero-dimensional (finite solutions) and raises a NotImplementedError otherwise. \n\nCurrently, the solve_biquadratic and solve_generic functions handle finite solutions and raise exceptions for cases they cannot handle yet. However, the problem described in the issue is about improving these functions to correctly identify and handle cases with infinite solutions. The relevant code spans include the entire solve_poly_system function, the specific part in _solve_reduced_system which checks for zero-dimensional systems, and the solve_generic function where the actual solving takes place. These parts need to be modified to include handling for infinite solutions.\n\nThus, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue as they address the core functionality for solving polynomial systems.",
