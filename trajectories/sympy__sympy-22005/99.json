The provided code spans include the main function `solve_poly_system`, as well as helper functions `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`. These functions handle different scenarios of polynomial systems solving. The critical section in `solve_generic` that checks for zero-dimensional systems and raises the `NotImplementedError` if not met is relevant to the issue. Additionally, the `solve_poly_system` function itself is crucial as it initializes and processes the polynomial system.
