The traceback indicates that the system is expecting a finite number of solutions but encounters an infinite solution situation that is not correctly handled, leading to an unexpected result. The provided search results contain the implementation of the functions `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, which are directly related to handling polynomial systems. The code includes checks for dimension and the number of polynomials to determine if they form a zero-dimensional system, which directly impacts the ability to handle infinite solution sets. It is essential to review the conditional logics in `solve_poly_system`, especially around the evaluation of single-univariate polynomials, as the patch suggests that the system's behavior is tied to the condition involving the length of univariate polynomials and the number of gens. Identifying the relevant spans in the search results that deal with these checks and dimensional evaluations aligns closely with the reported issue.",
