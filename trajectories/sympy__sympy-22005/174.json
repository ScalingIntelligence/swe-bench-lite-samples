The search results contain the implementation of the `solve_poly_system` function and related helpers like `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`. The `solve_generic` function includes the `_solve_reduced_system` method, which contains the logic for handling polynomial systems and raises the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. The changes in the issue suggest modifying the condition to check for univariate systems specifically when the number of generators is also 1, which aligns with the current state of the code.
