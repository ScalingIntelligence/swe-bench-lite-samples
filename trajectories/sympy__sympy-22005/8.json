The issue points out that certain cases are not handled correctly, specifically when provided with an equation that results in an infinite number of solutions, as demonstrated in the provided test cases.\n\n1. The provided code snippet for 'solve_poly_system' shows a direct call to 'solve_generic' after attempting to solve biquadratic equations if the inputs comply with specific checks.\n2. Within 'solve_generic', the '_solve_reduced_system' function is responsible for handling the reduction of the system of polynomial equations (basis) using Groebner bases to identify the solution.\n3. A crucial step in this function is the identification of univariate basis elements, implying dependencies on a single variable. This is the point where the system likely fails to handle equations leading to infinite solutions if the number of variables involved equals the number of univariate equations (which is a sign of a system with infinite solutions.\n4. The proposed diff in the issue suggests a modification to the condition checking the number of univariate basis elements, further confirming the hypothesis that the issue lies in the handling of these systems.\n5. Based on the analysis, the identified span 'solve_generic' encapsulates the relevant code that needs inspection to implement the suggested fix, as it currently lacks the handling of non-zero-dimensional systems.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, I will now proceed to provide the JSON output highlighting the relevant spans.",
