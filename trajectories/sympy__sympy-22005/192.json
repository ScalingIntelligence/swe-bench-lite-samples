The '_solve_reduced_system' function raises a 'NotImplementedError' when it encounters a system that is not zero-dimensional, which directly relates to having an infinite number of solutions. To address this, we need to look for utility functions or modules elsewhere in the 'sympy' library that might offer capabilities in handling infinite solution spaces, particularly in the context of polynomial systems. Furthermore, reviewing related documentation or tests could provide insights into how similar cases are managed in other parts of the library. Given the complexity and the specific nature of the issue, it's crucial to ensure that any changes do not inadvertently affect the handling of zero-dimensional systems or introduce bugs into the existing functionality.",

This might involve checking for conditions such as linear dependence among the polynomials or identifying systems that can be parameterized with fewer equations than unknowns. Once such a system is identified as having infinite solutions, the function should then handle this case appropriately, perhaps by returning a parameterized form of the solution or an object that represents the infinite solution set.
