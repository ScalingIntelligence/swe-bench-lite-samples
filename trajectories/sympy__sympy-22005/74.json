The provided search results contain several key functions and logic related to solving polynomial systems, such as `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The logic within these functions determines how to handle different types of polynomial systems and whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions.\n\nRelevant code spans to address the reported issue should focus on where the system's dimensionality is checked and where exceptions for unsupported cases are raised. This includes the `solve_poly_system` function itself, where the system is initially processed, and the `solve_generic` function, which handles more complex cases and raises the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. The specific condition that needs to be checked and potentially modified is the one raising the `NotImplementedError` in `solve_generic`, which is currently based on the system's dimensionality indicated through Groebner bases. Enhancing this check to also handle specific cases like the one in the reported issue (where one variable is constant and the other varies) could help resolve the issue. It might also be beneficial to review the `solve_biquadratic` function if it is part of the handling of such systems, although it seems more oriented towards specifically bi-quadratic systems.",
