The current code in the search results includes functions related to solving polynomial systems such as `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. These functions deal with the core functionality of handling polynomial systems. Notably, `_solve_reduced_system` contains the logic for handling univariate polynomials and raises a NotImplementedError for systems not supported (i.e., those not zero-dimensional). This matches the issue report, suggesting the need to modify this part of the code to correctly identify and handle cases where there's an infinite number of solutions. The suggested diff in the issue also hints at the potential modification needed in `_solve_reduced_system` by adding a check on the number of generators. Thus, the relevant code spans are those dealing directly with handling polynomial systems and the specific exception raising for unsupported cases.",

Upon inspecting the file context, we can see the implementation of `solve_poly_system` and related functions such as `solve_generic` and `_solve_reduced_system`, which contain the error handling for only supporting zero-dimensional systems (finite number of solutions). The file context includes the portion of the code that specifically raises a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems, but there's no explicit handling for detecting or managing infinite solutions beyond this. The mentioned test cases in the issue suggest that infinite solution detection is not fully implemented.
