The relevant error is a `NotImplementedError` when dealing with systems that have an infinite number of solutions. The core functionality seems to be in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, but related functionalities may be scattered in other modules such as `sympy/solvers/solvers.py`, `sympy/solvers/solveset.py`, and possibly others. Thus, the search should focus on these modules, and more specifically, on the functions `solve_poly_system` and `_solve_reduced_system` within `polysys.py`.",

The reported issue indicates that the system is expected to raise a 'NotImplementedError' for infinite solution cases but doesn't handle it correctly for certain cases like 'solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)'. The search results provide several key sections of code that are relevant: \n1. 'sympy/solvers/polysys.py' contains the main implementation of 'solve_poly_system', which is where the issue likely needs to be addressed. The 'solve_generic' function within this file also provides a framework for solving generic polynomial systems, which could include systems with infinite solutions.\n2. 'sympy/solvers/solveset.py' contains utility functions and the 'nonlinsolve' function, which is used for solving nonlinear systems. This file is relevant because it might need adjustments to correctly identify and handle infinite solution cases. \nThe identified code spans focus on the core functionalities related to solving polynomial systems and handling infinite solutions. By addressing these sections, it should be possible to implement the necessary changes to correctly identify and handle systems with infinite solutions.",
