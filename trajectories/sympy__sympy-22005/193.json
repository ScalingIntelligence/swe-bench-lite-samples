The issue points out that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly, suggesting that the case where the length of univariate basis is 1 but not all gens have been processed is not properly addressed. The suggested fix is to check whether the length of the univariate basis is 1 and if the number of gens left to be processed equals 1. From the search results, we have three crucial code spans: 'solve_poly_system' where the function is defined, 'solve_biquadratic' where biquadratic equations are solved, and 'solve_generic' where a generic polynomial system is solved. The span 'solve_generic' contains the '_solve_reduced_system' function where the check for univariate basis length should be implemented, coinciding with the point raised in the issue. Since this forms the core logic in handling polynomial equations, these spans are deemed relevant. Other functionalities like 'solve_biquadratic' also affect the solution process for polynomial systems but directly related errors or corrective calls are absent from the tags without additional context indicating potential errors. Thus, based on the specific issues highlighted, emphasis is made on the 'solve_generic' span.",
