Specifically, the example provided shows that when the system has an infinite number of solutions, it should raise a `NotImplementedError`, but it doesn't handle the case correctly when the system has one univariate equation. I analyzed the code in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` and found that the function `solve_poly_system` and `solve_generic` are relevant, especially the part where it checks for univariate equations and raises an error for non-zero-dimensional systems. The `solve_poly_system` function needs to be modified to handle infinite solutions appropriately within the context of one univariate equation. No other files seem directly relevant to the reported issue except for potentially adding new test cases in the test file, which was provided in the diff.",
