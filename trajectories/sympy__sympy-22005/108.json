The solve_poly_system span contains the main function definition, which includes the logic for handling polynomial systems, including a special case for biquadratic systems. The solve_biquadratic span contains the implementation for solving biquadratic systems. The solve_generic span contains the generic solver for polynomial systems, which includes the _solve_reduced_system function that raises a NotImplementedError for non-zero-dimensional systems. This last part is particularly relevant to the reported issue, as it is the point where the error is being raised for systems with infinite solutions.
