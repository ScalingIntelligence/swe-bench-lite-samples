Specifically, it points out that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` should not be returning a finite solution because it represents an infinite solution system. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the detection and response to such infinite solution cases. The provided search results include key functions like `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, which are used in solving polynomial systems. However, the most relevant span appears to be `_solve_reduced_system`, as it contains the logic for handling different dimensions of polynomial systems, including checks for zero-dimensional systems (finite solutions only) and raises a `NotImplementedError` for other cases. This is directly related to the issue of detecting infinite solution systems. Additionally, the provided diff in the issue suggests modifying the condition to check for univariate systems, which further supports focusing on `_solve_reduced_system` for relevant code spans.",
