The provided search results include functions `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, which are relevant as they handle the solving of polynomial systems. The function `solve_generic` contains the logic for solving the system generically, which includes a section about handling univariate polynomials and raising a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. This logic seems directly related to the issue of detecting infinite solutions. Therefore, the analysis focuses on identifying code spans within the `solve_generic` function that are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying to address the reported issue.",
