The example provided shows a case where the function does not handle a system with an infinite number of solutions correctly, resulting in an incorrect solution [(1,)]. The issue is further highlighted by a proposed diff that enhances the detection of univariate systems but suggests further handling is needed for such cases.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, I see that the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file contains several sections of code that are directly related to solving polynomial systems, including `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The `solve_generic` function includes the `_solve_reduced_system` method which raises a `NotImplementedError` for systems that are not zero-dimensional, which indicates infinite solution systems.\n\nThis code is highly relevant as it directly addresses the functionality for solving polynomial systems and handling error cases for unsupported systems, as highlighted in the issue. The file also includes the `solve_biquadratic` function, which is used to handle specific types of bivariate polynomial systems and could potentially be related to the infinite solution detection.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently identify the relevant code spans in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` that are crucial for addressing the reported issue of detecting infinite solution requests.",
