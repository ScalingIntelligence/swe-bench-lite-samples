The error trace indicates that the function is not handling certain cases correctly, specifically when a single polynomial equation is provided with multiple variables. The goal is to identify and fix the code responsible for this behavior. Given the context, it's likely that the critical part of the code lies within `polysys.py` where `solve_poly_system` and related functions are defined. Additionally, there might be relevant code in `solvers.py` and `solveset.py` as they deal with solving functions and polynomial systems respectively.",
