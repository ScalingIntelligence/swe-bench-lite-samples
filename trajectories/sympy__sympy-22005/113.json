The current implementation in 'solve_poly_system' and related functions like 'solve_biquadratic' and 'solve_generic' should be reviewed to find the exact spots where handling for infinite solutions could be added or improved. The search results have shown the relevant parts of the code where these functions are implemented, especially the 'solve_poly_system' and 'solve_biquadratic' functions which directly relate to the reported issue.

This process aligns with the requirements of detecting infinite solutions as described in the issue.
