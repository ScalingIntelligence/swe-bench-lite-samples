The issue is particularly concerned with how the function handles systems where the number of solutions might be infinite, as indicated by the NotImplementedError. The relevant code spans are those where the error handling and system dimension checks occur, specifically within `solve_generic`. The `_solve_reduced_system` function within `solve_generic` contains the logic for checking the dimensionality of the system and raising the NotImplementedError for non-zero-dimensional systems. This matches the issue's description. The other functions, `solve_poly_system` and `solve_biquadratic`, are part of the overall solving process but do not specifically address the infinite solution handling as directly as `solve_generic` does.
