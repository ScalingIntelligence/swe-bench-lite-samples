The primary focus is on identifying and modifying the relevant code spans in the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file to handle this scenario correctly. \n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are found in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, specifically in the functions `solve_poly_system` and `solve_generic`. These functions are responsible for solving polynomial systems and handling generic cases, respectively. The spans identified as relevant include the block where the `solve_generic` function raises a `NotImplementedError` for zero-dimensional systems and the implementation of the `solve_poly_system` function, which initially attempts to solve the system using specific methods before falling back to generic solving methods. \n\nBy analyzing these spans, we can confirm that they are central to the logic surrounding polynomial system solutions and therefore directly relevant to the reported issue. The code spans in `solve_generic` that raise the `NotImplementedError` indicate that the current implementation does not support infinite solutions, which matches the issue's description. The `solve_poly_system` function, being the primary interface for solving polynomial systems, is also crucial for addressing the issue since it coordinates how systems are solved.\n\nConsidering the provided context and the analysis of the search results, the relevant code spans have been successfully identified, and the search task can be considered complete.",
