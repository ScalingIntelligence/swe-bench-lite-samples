The search results contain relevant code spans within `polysys.py`, including the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions. These functions are crucial for handling polynomial systems and detecting solutions. Specifically, the `solve_poly_system` function attempts to solve polynomial systems, which might include cases with infinite solutions. The `solve_generic` function contains logic for solving systems of polynomials using Groebner bases, which is a key method for handling such systems. The `solve_biquadratic` function handles specific cases of bivariate quadratic systems. These code spans are relevant because they provide the codebase's mechanisms for solving polynomial systems, which directly relate to the reported issue of infinite solutions.",
