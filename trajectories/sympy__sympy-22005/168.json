There is a specific traceback indicating that infinite solutions are not supported and raises a `NotImplementedError`. The provided diff shows a modification to `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` to handle a specific case where a univariate polynomial might lead to an infinite solution detection. However, it seems not all cases (like the polynomial `y - 1`) are being correctly handled, leading to incorrect results [(1,)]. Additionally, test cases are updated to ensure that certain polynomials raise the `NotImplementedError`. Given this context, it is clear that the primary focus should be on the `solve_poly_system` function and related error handling in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`.",

Specifically, the issue arises when the function is not correctly handling cases where the system has an infinite number of solutions, as demonstrated by the example where `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` should raise a `NotImplementedError`, but instead returns `[(1,)]`, indicating it incorrectly assumes a finite solution. To address this, it's crucial to identify the part of the code responsible for checking the finite dimensionality of the solution space. The provided `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file contains the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions, among others, which collectively handle the solving of polynomial systems. Within these functions, we find the `solve_generic` function, which includes the `_solve_reduced_system` inner function. This function uses Groebner bases to handle polynomial system solving. The relevant portion of the code where the issue could be addressed is at the point where it attempts to filter univariate polynomials to check if the system is finite-dimensional.",
