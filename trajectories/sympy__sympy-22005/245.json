The issue is likely localized within the `solve_poly_system` function and its related handling of polynomial systems.

The provided search results contain critical functions related to the solving process, specifically `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The issue indicates that currently, the system does not handle one-dimensional systems correctly and that it should raise a `NotImplementedError` instead of returning a potentially incorrect result. This suggests that the relevant code spans should include those parts of the code that deal with the detection of one-dimensional systems and the error handling mechanism. Specifically, the span `solve_poly_system` and `solve_generic` are directly related to the solving of polynomial systems and should be examined for potential modifications to correctly handle one-dimensional cases.\n\nThe span `solve_generic` contains the function `_solve_reduced_system`, which currently raises a `NotImplementedError` for systems that do not meet the requirement of being zero-dimensional. This is a critical part of the codebase that needs to be modified considering the report. The error message in the current implementation does not differentiate between cases that should and should not be supported, which could lead to incorrect handling of systems with one independent variable.\n\nGiven the provided diff suggestion, it's clear that there's a need to modify the condition checking for the univariate case in `_solve_reduced_system` to specifically check if the number of gens (variables) is one and if the system is indeed univariate. This specific condition needs to be addressed in the existing implementation.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans are those that need to be modified or examined to ensure proper handling of one-dimensional systems, specifically to include the case detection suggested in the reported issue.",
