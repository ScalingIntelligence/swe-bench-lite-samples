The provided code snippet shows the developer's attempt through a code diff to modify the current implementation. The key focus seems to be on identifying cases where the system should raise a NotImplementedError indicating that only zero-dimensional systems (finite number of solutions) are supported. From the given search results, it appears that the `solve_poly_system` function and its supporting methods like `solve_generic`, `_solve_reduced_system`, and the unimplemented part for handling higher dimensions are critical to addressing this issue. Notably, the search results contain the same file `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` where the reported line suggesting an implementation change is situated. Analyzing further, it's evident that the function `_solve_reduced_system` contains the logic for handling system reduction based on Groebner bases and solving univariate polynomials. This suggests that the relevant code spans to address the infinite solution issue could be within the implementation of `_solve_reduced_system` or its helper functions such as `_is_univariate`, `_subs_root`, and the raising of `NotImplementedError` where the system dimensions are not zero-dimensional.",
