The reported issue mentions handling of systems where an infinite number of solutions might be incorrectly indicated although finite solution support is only present, referring particularly examples such as `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)`. Existing context and search results indicate inception within `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file sections involving function declarations `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`. These functions heavily invoke Groebner basis analysis amongst others that predominantly target the detection of zero-dimensional (finite solution counting) polynomial systems. From initial diff analysis and code review, primed suspect towards resolving this matter appears to revolve around editing the `_solve_reduced_system` function to initiate preventive measures before errors are signaled where dimensions and adequacy of input are genuinely disputed, steering clear from infinite case submission that has already designated an `NotImplementedError` for finite solution attributes mess up in the received input.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of univariate detection within `_solve_reduced_system` is imperative for functionality, refining system dimension validation parameter caption differentiates between solution types (zero-dimensional for finite and otherwise for infinite). This addition limits preventions further, picking significantly on encounters that may result into ambiguous or infinite solutions which do not fit predetermined error handling patterns hence alleges the role of an initiator in rectification and fostering accuracy enhancement into polynomial system solution methods.",
