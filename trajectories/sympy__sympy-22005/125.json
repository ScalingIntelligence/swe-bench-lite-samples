The provided diff suggests changes to the `_solve_reduced_system` function, adding a condition to raise the error when the system's variables are not limited to zero-dimensional systems. The search results include relevant functions such as `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, which handle different aspects of solving polynomial systems. The `_solve_reduced_system` function, crucial for this issue, is also present in the search results. Evaluating the code in these functions, especially the sections dealing with dimensionality and handling specific cases like univariate polynomials, should provide a comprehensive understanding and relevant code spans to address the issue.",
