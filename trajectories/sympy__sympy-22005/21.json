Specifically, `solve_generic` contains the `_solve_reduced_system` method which is likely where the fix needs to be applied. The code spans covering these functions are relevant as they touch upon the core functionality of solving polynomial systems and thus are likely to be where the fix for the infinite solution issue would be implemented.
