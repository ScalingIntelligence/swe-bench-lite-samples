Initially, the search results show several files that might be relevant, including `polysys.py`, `diophantine.py`, and `solveset.py`. The key function to focus on is `solve_poly_system` in `polysys.py`, which directly relates to solving polynomial systems. Additionally, `diophantine.py` contains various solvers which might indirectly relate if polynomial systems extend into these areas. Several spans within `polysys.py` and `diophantine.py` involve the checking and handling of polynomial equations, which could be the main concern for managing infinite solutions. Specifically, the diff fragment provided indicates an intention to refine the `_solve_reduced_system` function by adding a condition to handle univariate solutions more accurately; this likely affects our original concern since the detection of a univariate system can indicate infinitely many solutions for systems with more than one generator. After examining all relevant sections, the identified spans in `polysys.py` and `diophantine.py` thoroughly cover the key processing areas for polynomial systems and might directly or indirectly involve handling infinite solutions.",
