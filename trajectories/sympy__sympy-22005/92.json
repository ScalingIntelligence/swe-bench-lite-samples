The error `NotImplementedError` should be raised for systems that do not have a finite number of solutions. The specific case that needs handling correctly is when the system contains polynomial equations that do not have a finite number of solutions, such as `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)`. The relevant files to investigate are those that contain the `solve_poly_system` function and related error handling. Based on the provided context, the file `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` is likely the primary location for this function. Additionally, the `NotImplementedError` handling might be spread across related modules like `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` and `sympy/solvers/solveset.py`. Given the context, focusing on these files with specific attention to the function `solve_poly_system` and error handling around infinite solutions should suffice for the initial investigation.",

Specifically, the issue mentions that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly, which should raise a `NotImplementedError` instead of returning `[(1,)]`. The provided diff suggests modifications to `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` and `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py` to address this. Given the search results, the most relevant sections are in `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` and `sympy/solvers/solveset.py`. These files contain functions related to solving systems of equations and handling poly systems. Specifically, the `_solve_system` function in `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` and the `nonlinsolve` function in `sympy/solvers/solveset.py` are promising starting points as they are involved in solving systems of equations including polynomial systems. Additionally, the `solve_poly_system` function in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` is directly related to solving polynomial systems and should be reviewed for implementations and conditions that may lead to infinite solutions. These functions and their implementations should be analyzed to identify if they correctly handle the conditions specified in the issue, such as raising `NotImplementedError` for systems that might have infinite solutions.",
