Currently, the function throws a `NotImplementedError` for systems containing infinite solutions when it should instead handle or raise a more appropriate error. This will involve modifying the logic in `_solve_reduced_system` to correctly identify these cases and handle them accordingly. The specific change that needs to be made is to update the condition that checks for univariate functions. This should ensure that if we only have one univariate function but more than one generator, it should raise a `NotImplementedError` indicating that infinite solutions are not supported for systems with more than one variable. The current condition is not strict enough and does not account for these edge cases.",
