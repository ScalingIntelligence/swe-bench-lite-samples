The provided search results contain significant sections of the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file which are highly relevant to solving polynomial systems, including the `solve_poly_system` function that directly addresses the issue.\n\n1. The issue suggests that the function should raise a NotImplementedError for certain cases involving infinite solutions, which currently it does not seem to do. This suggests a need to modify or extend the logic in the `solve_poly_system` function.\n2. The search results include the `solve_generic` function, which appears to handle general cases of polynomial systems but currently raises a NotImplementedError for non-zero-dimensional systems (which likely include infinite solutions). This function is critical for understanding the broader context of how polynomial systems are solved in SymPy.\n3. Additionally, the results include the `solve_reduced_system` function, which is where the NotImplementedError is currently raised for non-zero-dimensional systems. This function would need to be adjusted to properly handle the infinite solution cases.\n4. The search also revealed the `solve_biquadratic` function, though it is less directly related to the current issue, it provides valuable context on how SymPy attempts to solve particular types of polynomial systems.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans are identified in the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file, particularly those related to the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_generic`, and `solve_reduced_system` functions.
