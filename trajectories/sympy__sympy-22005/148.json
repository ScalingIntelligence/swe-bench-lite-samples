In the search results, we find the implementation of `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The relevant portions are the `solve_poly_system` function where the initial handling occurs, and the `solve_generic` function which contains the `_solve_reduced_system` method where the core logic for solving the polynomial system is located. The span with the id 'solve_poly_system' is relevant because it checks the number of equations and variables, which is critical for the fix. The 'solve_generic' span is also relevant as it contains the logic for solving the system, including the handling of univariate and multivariate cases, which might need adjustment to correctly raise an error for infinite solution cases. The 'solve_biquadratic' span is less directly relevant but shows the handling of specific cases which might be informative for understanding the overall context of polynomial solving in the module.
