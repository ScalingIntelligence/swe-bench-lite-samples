The other functions, solve_biquadratic and solve_poly_system, do not directly handle the error as they are designed for different scenarios (biquadratic equations and a specific type of polynomial system, respectively).

The provided code context and search results show function implementations and models relevant to polynomial system solving, including solve_poly_system, solve_biquadratic, and solve_generic functions.
