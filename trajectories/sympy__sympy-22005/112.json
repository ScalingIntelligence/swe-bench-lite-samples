Specifically, the example provided shows that for the polynomial system `(y - 1,)`, the function does not handle it correctly and returns a result where it should raise a `NotImplementedError`. The current context does not have any identified relevant code yet. However, from the search results, it is clear that the code spans related to `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions are highly relevant as they are directly involved in handling polynomial systems and their solutions. The `solve_poly_system` function is the entry point for solving polynomial systems, and it calls `solve_biquadratic` for specific cases and `solve_generic` for other cases. The `solve_generic` function contains a sub-function `_solve_reduced_system` which is critical for identifying and handling the cases of zero-dimensional systems. The modification suggested in the issue regarding the infinite solution detection is likely to be incorporated within the `_solve_reduced_system` function where it checks for univariate systems and raises a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional cases. Therefore, the relevant code spans to investigate further are those related to these functions.",

The traceback indicates that the system only supports zero-dimensional systems (finite number of solutions). The example provided shows that the system does not handle a case correctly where it should raise a `NotImplementedError` but instead returns a `[(1,)]` solution.\n\n2. The current file context provided includes the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`.\n\n3.1. Analyzing each code span in the new search results, I see that the search results are identical to the context provided. This suggests that the search mechanism might not have found new relevant code.\n3.2. The key elements, functions, variables, or patterns identified in the reported issue are `solve_poly_system`, `NotImplementedError`, and the handling of polynomial systems.\n3.3. The relevance of the `solve_poly_system` function is clear as it is directly related to the reported issue. The `solve_generic` function is also relevant because it supports the solving of polynomial systems, especially considering it includes the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems.\n3.4. The search results do not suggest new functions or classes, neither do they present any code that might be relevant to implementing new functionality.\n3.5. Reviewing the entire sections of code, including their comments, did not reveal additional relevant partes or references to other parts of the codebase that might be relevant.\n3.6. Based on the provided search results and current file context, there are no missing references to other parts of the codebase.\n3.7. The relevant code spans for the reported issue are within `solve_poly_system` and `solve_generic`.\n\n4. I will use the Identify function to provide the response.",
