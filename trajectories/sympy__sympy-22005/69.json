The example provided shows that the system is incorrectly handling certain cases where a single polynomial equation is provided. The key elements to look for are the functions `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` which are relevant for solving polynomial systems. The error message suggests focusing on the handling of zero-dimensional systems and the part of the code that raises the `NotImplementedError`. In the search results, the function `solve_poly_system` and its related functions are found, including `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`, which include the logic for solving polynomial systems and handling specific cases like bi-quadratic equations. These sections are evaluated for relevance based on the reported issue. Based on the analysis, the relevant sections of the code are identified as those handling the polynomial system solving and the error raising for unimplemented features.",

Specifically, the issue occurs when the input is `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)`, which should raise a `NotImplementedError` but does not. The provided file context and search results contain several relevant code spans that need to be analyzed to determine where the fix should be applied. The key sections include the `solve_poly_system` function, the `_solve_reduced_system` function, and the `solve_biquadratic` function. Additionally, there are test cases in `test_polysys.py` that need to be updated to properly test for the infinite solution scenario. By analyzing these sections, we can identify the necessary changes to handle the infinite solution correctly and ensure that the appropriate error is raised.",
