However, the example provided shows an incorrect handling where a univariate polynomial system (with potentially infinite solutions) is not raising the expected NotImplementedError. To address this, we should focus on the 'solve_poly_system' function and related methods in the 'polysys.py' and 'solvers.py' files, where the logic for determining the dimensionality of the system and handling such cases is likely implemented. Additionally, considering the presence of the 'NotImplementedError' in the Traceback, we should look for occurrences of this error in the context of polynomial system solving.",

The example provided shows that when passing the polynomial system `(y - 1,)` with variables `x` and `y`, the function does not handle the infinite solution case correctly and returns a misleading result. This suggests that the function needs to be enhanced to properly detect and handle infinite solutions. \n\nIn the provided search results, we see the implementation of the `solve_poly_system` function, which includes several key parts: `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The `solve_generic` function is of particular interest because it includes the `_solve_reduced_system` method, which raises the `NotImplementedError` for systems with a finite number of solutions. This is directly related to the issue because it indicates where the detection of infinite solutions might be missing or incorrectly handled. \n\nThe code spans identified in the search results are relevant because they show the main logic for solving polynomial systems, including how it handles different cases like biquadratic equations and generic systems. This aligns with the need to revise how the system handles infinite solutions. Therefore, the relevant code spans focus on the `solve_poly_system` and its helper functions where the logic for handling and detecting infinite solutions should be implemented or improved.",
