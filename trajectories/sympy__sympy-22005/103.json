Specifically, the example provided in the issue shows that the function does not handle correctly the case where a polynomial system indicates an infinite number of solutions (e.g., `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)`). The provided search results consist of three key functions: `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The function `solve_generic` contains the logic for solving polynomial systems, and within this function, the `_solve_reduced_system` method raises a `NotImplementedError` when dealing with systems that are not zero-dimensional. This is directly related to the issue as the reported problem seems to be the function's inability to handle non-zero-dimensional systems appropriately. The identified code spans are relevant as they involve the core functionality related to the solving of polynomial systems and the handling of errors indicating unsupported solution types. Hence, these code spans are deemed relevant to the reported issue.",
