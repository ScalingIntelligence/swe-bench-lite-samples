The provided search results contain several relevant code spans: `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. Within `solve_generic`, the function `_solve_reduced_system` is particularly relevant as it contains the logic for handling polynomial systems and raises the `NotImplementedError` for systems that are not zero-dimensional. This aligns with the issue of infinite solutions not being handled correctly. The current implementation in `_solve_reduced_system` does not correctly handle the case of infinite solutions, which is evident from the example provided in the issue where the system `(y - 1,)` does not raise the expected `NotImplementedError`. By examining these code spans and understanding their functionality, it becomes clear that they are all directly related to the issue at hand.
