The provided search results show relevant code snippets, including the `solve_poly_system` function itself, which is the main entry point for solving polynomial systems. It identifies the functions `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`, which are called by `solve_poly_system` to handle different types of polynomial systems. The `solve_generic` function includes a subfunction `_solve_reduced_system` that is responsible for solving the system using Groebner bases. This function raises a `NotImplementedError` for systems that are not zero-dimensional (i.e., systems with an infinite number of solutions).
