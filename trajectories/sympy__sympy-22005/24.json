The current implementation raises `NotImplementedError` for zero-dimensional systems only, indicating it doesn't handle the infinite solution case correctly. The provided search results contain several key functions in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, such as `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, which are directly related to handling polynomial systems. Notably, the `solve_generic` function includes the `_solve_reduced_system` method where the `NotImplementedError` is raised for non-zero-dimensional systems. This code span is particularly relevant as it currently handles only zero-dimensional systems and would need to be updated to handle the infinite solution case as described. Additionally, the `solve_biquadratic` function is examined to ensure it does not inadvertently handle cases that should raise the error for infinite solutions.
