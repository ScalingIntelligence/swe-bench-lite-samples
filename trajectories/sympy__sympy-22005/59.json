The example provided shows that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` does not raise the expected `NotImplementedError`, indicating that it incorrectly handles the case of an infinite solution space. In reviewing the provided search results, the key parts relevant to the issue are the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions within `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`. These functions directly deal with solving polynomial systems and could potentially include the logic for detecting and handling infinite solutions. Specifically, the `_solve_reduced_system` function, which is called by `solve_generic`, contains the `NotImplementedError` indicating support only for zero-dimensional systems. This suggests that any code modifications needed to correctly handle infinite solution scenarios would likely be made in this context. Additionally, the `solve_biquadratic` function may also be relevant as it deals with special 2-dimensional cases that could lead to infinite solutions if not handled appropriately.",
