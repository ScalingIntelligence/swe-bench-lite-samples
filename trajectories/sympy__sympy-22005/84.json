The examples given show that `solve_poly_system((x - 1,), x, y)` correctly raises a `NotImplementedError`, while `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` does not raise an error and instead returns an incorrect solution `[(1,)]`. The provided context suggests that the fix involves modifying the condition for raising the `NotImplementedError` in `_solve_reduced_system` to include cases where `len(gens) == 1`. The search results include the functions `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, with `solve_generic` containing the function `_solve_reduced_system`. The relevant code spans are in `_solve_reduced_system` where the condition for raising the `NotImplementedError` is defined. This condition should be modified to handle the case where `len(univariate) == 1` and `len(gens) == 1`. The existing condition checks only for `len(univariate) == 1`, which does not account for systems with a single generator (variable). The identified code spans include both the existing condition that needs modification and the surrounding context to fully understand and manage the scenario.",

This matches the behavior reported in the issue. The change in the diff suggests modifying the condition for univariate systems, which is present in the _solve_reduced_system function within solve_generic.
