The provided example shows that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly, and it should raise a `NotImplementedError`. 2. Reviewing the search results, the most relevant code span is in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` under the `solve_poly_system` function. This function is responsible for solving polynomial systems. 3. The provided patch suggests a change to the condition `if len(univariate) == 1` to `if len(univariate) == 1 and len(gens) == 1`. This suggests that the issue might be due to an incorrect handling of the number of variables or equations. 4. Other relevant spans include the imports in `sympy/solvers/solvers.py`, particularly those related to `solve_poly_system`. This suggests that `solve_poly_system` is used in multiple contexts within the solver module. 5. The `solve` and `_solve` functions in `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` also seem relevant as they deal with solving equations and may call `solve_poly_system` internally. 6. The `_solve_system` function in `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` is relevant as it handles systems of equations, which may include polynomial systems. 7. The `sympy/solvers/solveset.py` file contains additional solver functions that may be indirectly related to the issue by virtue of being part of the broader solver infrastructure.",

This indicates a need to enhance error handling for certain cases in the `solve_poly_system` function.\n2. The current context shows a partial implementation of `solve_poly_system` in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, which includes handling for biquadratic systems and generic systems.\n3. The search results provide additional context of the `solve_poly_system` function, including its role in solving polynomial systems, handling biquadratic equations, and using Groebner bases for solving generic systems.\n4. From the context, it is clear that the function lacks specific handling for cases where the system might have an infinite number of solutions, which is likely the cause of the reported issue.\n5. The identified issue suggests that a check for potentially infinite solutions should be added to `solve_poly_system` to ensure it raises the appropriate `NotImplementedError` to match the expected behavior described in the issue.\n6. Given the provided search results and context, the task involves identifying the location in the code where this check should be added to handle the described case accurately.",
