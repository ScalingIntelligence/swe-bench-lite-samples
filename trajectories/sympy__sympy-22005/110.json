The key part of the code to focus on is the check for univariate polynomials and the handling of zero-dimensional systems in solve_generic. The direct solution to the issue involves modifying the condition check in the _solve_reduced_system function to differentiate between univariate and multivariate infinite solutions.

This is evident from the provided diff in the issue, which shows a proposed modification in the `_solve_reduced_system` function to handle specific cases better. The file context provided is relevant, containing the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions, all of which are involved in solving polynomial systems. The new search results confirm the presence of these functions in the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file. Given the context and issue, it is clear that the primary focus is on the `_solve_reduced_system` function where the proposed change impacts the handling of univariate polynomials. The relevant code spans to address the infinite solution detection issue are those that deal with how univariate polynomials are handled and how the system responds when the basis for solutions is reduced. The span IDs 'solve_poly_system', 'solve_biquadratic', and 'solve_generic' are relevant as they highlight the broader context of solving polynomial systems and, notably, the 'solve_generic' span, which contains the `_solve_reduced_system` function where the main logic for handling univariate polynomials and raising the NotImplementedError for non-zero-dimensional systems resides. This is crucial for addressing the reported issue.",
