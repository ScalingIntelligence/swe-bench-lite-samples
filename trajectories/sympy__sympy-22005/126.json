The provided search results show the relevant functions `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, which are central to solving polynomial systems in SymPy. The specific problem mentioned within the issue is triggered when the function attempts to solve an underdetermined system, which can result in infinite solutions. The provided code from the search results does not currently handle such cases and instead raises a `NotImplementedError`, indicating that the feature is not yet implemented for these types of systems. This observation aligns with the issue at hand, where the function `solve_poly_system` should raise a `NotImplementedError` for infinite solution systems to reflect that they are not supported, but it currently fails to do so. The code spans identify relevant functions and sections where enhancements or fixes need to be applied to address the issue.",

Specifically, this involves updating the condition where the function checks for univariate systems. It should now not only check if there is one univariate equation, but also confirm that the number of variables equals one, otherwise it should raise the 'NotImplementedError'. The goal is to ensure that unnecessary computational effort is not expended on systems that are not finite-dimensional, where solutions are potentially infinite.\n\nThe function '_solve_reduced_system' needs to be modified at the point where it checks for univariate systems. Currently, it raises a 'NotImplementedError' if there isn't exactly one univariate equation in the basis. The instruction specifies that this check should be updated to also ensure that the number of variables equals one, otherwise it should raise the 'NotImplementedError'. This change is needed at the line where it checks the length of the univariate list to be exactly one.",
