Specifically, the issue mentions that `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly, returning `[(1,)]` instead of raising an NotImplementedError. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans seem to be contained within the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file. This file contains the definitions of functions `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, which are all related to solving polynomial systems. The `solve_generic` function includes the critical `_solve_reduced_system` function, which contains the logic for handling zero-dimensional systems (finite solutions). The current implementation in `_solve_reduced_system` seems to raise a `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems, which aligns with the issue report. However, a specific condition that might control or alter this behavior is found in the span `solve_poly_system`, where the function attempts to solve a biquadratic system before falling back to the generic solver. This behavior might need to be adjusted to ensure that systems with infinite solutions are correctly identified and handled. Thus, the relevant spans include `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` to address the infinite solution detection.",
