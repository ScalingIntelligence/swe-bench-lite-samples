The key function appears to be `_solve_reduced_system`, which contains the logic for detecting whether the system has a finite number of solutions. There's a specific check in `_solve_reduced_system` that raises an `NotImplementedError` if the system isn't zero-dimensional, which aligns with the issue reported. However, the current logic doesn't handle the case where there's one polynomial in two variables correctly.\n\nIt's also noted that the code contains a comment suggesting improvements to the handling of non-zero-dimensional systems, which directly addresses the issue at hand.
