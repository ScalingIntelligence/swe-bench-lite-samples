The issue notes that 'solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)' is not handled correctly, which indicates a need to review the logic that determines the dimensionality of the system and how it affects the solution process. The proposed diff suggests modifying '_solve_reduced_system' to handle univariate systems where the number of variables equals the number of polynomials. Therefore, the focus should be on understanding and modifying functions associated with these processes to ensure they raise the appropriate errors or handle solutions correctly when dealing with infinite solutions.",
