The provided search results contain several functions related to solving polynomial systems, including `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The function `solve_generic` contains the logic for handling the system by reducing it, which includes a check for zero-dimensional systems. This section of the code is likely where the fix needs to be applied to correctly detect and handle cases with infinite solutions.
