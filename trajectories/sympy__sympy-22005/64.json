The error indicates that the current implementation only supports systems with a finite number of solutions (zero-dimensional systems). The task is to locate the code responsible for solving polynomial systems, particularly focusing on the function `solve_poly_system` and related functions. Given the file context provided, `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` seems to be the primary file of interest, as it contains `solve_poly_system`. Additionally, other files like `sympy/solvers/solvers.py`, `sympy/solvers/solveset.py`, and `sympy/polys/solvers.py` could also be relevant as they contain functions for solving various types of equations.",

The provided `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` example should raise a `NotImplementedError`, but it currently returns an incorrect result. We also look at the potential modifications suggested, specifically adding additional conditions to the length of `univariate` and `gens` in the `_solve_reduced_system` function. Reviewing the search results, we find multiple relevant parts of the codebase, particularly `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, where the `solve_poly_system` function is defined, and also several calling contexts within `sympy/solvers/solveset.py` and `sympy/solvers/solvers.py`. These call contexts are also important for understanding the overall usage and detection logic of infinite solution requests. By considering the entire content of the spans provided, we can accurately determine relevance and completeness.",

The `polysys.py` file includes the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions, which are crucial for solving polynomial systems. The `solvers.py` file includes utility functions like `nsolve`, which are used for numerical solving and could potentially be relevant for handling infinite solutions if combined with symbolic methods.\n\nGiven the context and the issue reported, the relevant code spans are those that involve the `solve_poly_system` function and the functions directly modifying or supporting it, such as `solve_biquadratic`, `solve_generic`, and possibly `nsolve` for handling numerical aspects.
