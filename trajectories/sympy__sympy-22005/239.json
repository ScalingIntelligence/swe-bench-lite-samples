The diff suggests modifications to handle such cases properly by raising a NotImplementedError. The search results contain the `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` functions, which are relevant to handling polynomial systems and detecting infinite solutions. The `solve_poly_system` function initializes the solving process, `solve_biquadratic` handles specific bivariate quadratic systems, and `solve_generic` handles more complex systems, including the detection of zero-dimensional systems. Based on the issue, the relevant code spans include the definition of `solve_poly_system`, the `solve_generic` function where the univariate case is handled, and the handling of the basis in `solve_generic` where the NotImplementedError is raised. These sections are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the code to correctly handle infinite solution cases as described in the issue.",
