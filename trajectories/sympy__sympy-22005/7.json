The provided code in polysys.py contains the main function solve_poly_system and two supporting functions, solve_biquadratic and solve_generic, which handle specific cases of polynomial systems. The solve_generic function further calls _solve_reduced_system, which uses Groebner bases to solve the system. The code already contains a check for univariate systems (which would be 1-dimensional) and raises a NotImplementedError for non-zero-dimensional systems. However, the specific case mentioned in the issue (solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)) is not correctly handled, as it should raise the NotImplementedError but instead returns a finite result. This suggests that the issue lies in the _solve_reduced_system function's handling of such cases. Identifying the relevant code spans around these functions and the specific check for univariate systems will help address the issue.",
