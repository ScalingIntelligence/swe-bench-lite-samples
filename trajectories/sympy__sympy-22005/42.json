The search results contain relevant functions such as `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`, which are all involved in solving polynomial systems. In particular, the `solve_generic` function includes the `_solve_reduced_system` method that checks for univariate cases and is likely where the error handling for infinite solutions should be implemented. This function currently raises a `NotImplementedError` but does not check for the case where there is a univariate polynomial but multiple variables are involved, which is the scenario described in the issue. The code span in `solve_generic` related to `_solve_reduced_system` should be revised to handle these cases. Therefore, the identified spans are the relevant parts of the codebase that need to be updated to handle infinite solution cases correctly.",
