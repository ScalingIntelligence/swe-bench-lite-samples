Specifically, the current implementation does not correctly handle cases where the system has an infinite number of solutions. The code should raise a `NotImplementedError` for such cases. Analyzing the search results, the primary functions involved in the solution process are `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic`. The `solve_generic` function contains the logic for handling the system of polynomials and raises the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. Based on the reported issue, the relevant parts of the code are those responsible for identifying and handling zero-dimensional systems, which includes the `_solve_reduced_system` function within `solve_generic`. Consequently, the relevant file is 'sympy/solvers/polysys.py', and the relevant spans are those that deal with the system's dimensions and the handling of univariate systems, particularly the check for the length of univariate polynomials in the `_solve_reduced_system` function.",
