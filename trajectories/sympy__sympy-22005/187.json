The traceback and the intended behavior suggest that the function `solve_poly_system` in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` should raise a `NotImplementedError` for systems with an infinite number of solutions. However, it seems that the current implementation does not correctly handle all cases, as demonstrated by the incorrectly handled case `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)`. To address this, I need to locate the `solve_poly_system` function in the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file and possibly related functions that handle polynomial systems. Additionally, I should look for any test cases that might be related to this functionality in the test files.",

These functions are central to solving polynomial systems and need to be updated to address the issue.

The `NotImplementedError` is raised in this function, indicating that the handling of non-zero-dimensional systems is not implemented.
