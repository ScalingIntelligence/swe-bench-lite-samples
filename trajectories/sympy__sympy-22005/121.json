The provided file context shows the current implementation of `solve_poly_system`, `solve_biquadratic`, and `solve_generic` in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`. These functions are designed to handle polynomial systems but seem to lack proper detection for cases involving infinite solutions. From the search results, several code spans are found in various files related to polynomial handling, especially in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` where multiple methods for root finding and polynomial manipulation methods exist (e.g., `Poly.refine_root`, `Poly.ground_roots`, etc). These functions could be relevant for deepening the detection or resolution of infinite solution cases by integrating them with the current system handling in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`. Additionally, the `Poly.count_roots` method seems particularly relevant for checking how many solutions exist for a system, which is directly related to the type of error described in the issue.",

The issue specifically points to a case where `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` is not handled correctly. This implies that the function should raise a `NotImplementedError` for systems with an infinite number of solutions, but it doesn't. In the search results, the `solve_poly_system` function in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` is a key area of focus, as it directly pertains to solving polynomial systems. Additionally, the `Poly` class in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` is relevant because it likely interacts with the `solve_poly_system` function, and methods like `count_roots` and `ground_roots` could be useful for determining the dimensionality of the solution space. To fully address the issue, it's important to locate the specific part of the code where the `NotImplementedError` should be raised for infinite solution systems, particularly when dealing with univariate polynomials or specific generator configurations.",
