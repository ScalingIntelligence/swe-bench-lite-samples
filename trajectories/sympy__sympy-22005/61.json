The code spans identified as relevant include the entire solve_poly_system function, part of the _solve_reduced_system function (where the univariate check and NotImplementedError throw are located), and the solve_biquadratic function, which is related to solving specific types of polynomial systems. These sections are critical as they directly address the core functionality of solving polynomial systems and must be modified to handle infinite solutions appropriately.

Within `solve_generic`, the function `_solve_reduced_system` contains the logic for reducing systems of polynomials using Groebner bases and is where a `NotImplementedError` is currently raised for non-zero-dimensional systems. This function seems to be the most appropriate location for implementing the necessary checks for infinite solutions. The existing code structure provides a clear framework where modifications can be made, so I believe all relevant code spans needed to understand and implement the fix for the reported issue are present in the file context. Additionally, the test cases suggest specific scenarios that should raise a `NotImplementedError` to properly detect cases with infinite solutions.",
