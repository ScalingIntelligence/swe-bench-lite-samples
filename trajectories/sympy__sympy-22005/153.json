Specifically, it highlights a case where the function does not handle certain polynomial systems correctly, particularly when the system should theoretically have an infinite number of solutions but is instead returning a finite result erroneously. The provided search results contain relevant code spans in the same file that are likely associated with the issue. Firstly, the function 'solve_poly_system' is identified as the entry point for solving polynomial systems, which is directly related to the reported issue. Secondly, the 'solve_generic' function appears to handle the generic case, including the call to '_solve_reduced_system' where the error `NotImplementedError' is raised for non-zero-dimensional systems. This section is particularly relevant as it deals with the limitation mentioned in the issue. Finally, the '_solve_reduced_system' function contains the check for univariate polynomials and the corresponding error raising, which is directly tied to the error in the issue. Given these points, the relevant code spans are those that include the functions 'solve_poly_system', 'solve_generic', and the detailed logic within '_solve_reduced_system', as they deal directly with the function and error described in the issue.",
