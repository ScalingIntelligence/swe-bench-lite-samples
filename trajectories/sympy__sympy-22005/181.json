The current `solve_poly_system` function raises a `NotImplementedError` for such cases, which needs to be addressed. The suggested solution is to modify the condition in the `_solve_reduced_system` function to also check that the length of the generators (`gens`) is equal to 1 when the length of the univariate polynomials (`univariate`) is 1. The search results include the `solve_poly_system` function along with helper functions like `_solve_reduced_system`. These functions deal with solving polynomial systems and handling univariate polynomials, which are directly relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, the provided code spans are relevant to the reported issue and should contain the necessary context to address it.",
