The provided diff suggests a modification in the sympy/solvers/polysys.py file to enhance the handling of such cases. Additionally, test cases have been added in the sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py file to ensure that the function raises a NotImplementedError for equations resulting in infinite solutions.",

The traceback indicates that only zero-dimensional systems (finite number of solutions) are supported, and the specific example shows an unhandled case leading to an erroneous solution [(1,)]. The proposed solution involves modifying the `_solve_reduced_system` function by adding a condition to check if the length of variables equals one. This adjustment is aimed at differentiating between univariate and multivariate cases, ensuring appropriate handling of each, particularly for infinite solution detection. The code spans provided in the search results include functions related to solving polynomial systems, linear systems, and error handling. The `_solve_reduced_system` function in 'sympy/solvers/polysys.py' is directly relevant as it contains the logic for solving reduced systems and throws the `NotImplementedError` for non-zero-dimensional systems. Additionally, 'sympy/solvers/solveset.py' with its `nonlinsolve` function looks potentially relevant for broader context on solving systems of equations, although not directly implicated in the reported issue. Other spans, such as those related to benchmarks, special polynomials, and other error classes, while interesting, do not directly address the reported functionality issue. Therefore, the focus remains primarily on the `_solve_reduced_system` function for the necessary code span identification, with 'sympy/solvers/solveset.py' providing supplementary context.",

However, the specific issue regarding the detection of infinite solutions is not completely addressed in the given code. The `solve_poly_system` function raises a `NotImplementedError` for systems that are not zero-dimensional, which implies a finite number of solutions. The issue expects handling for infinite solutions, which is not explicitly addressed in the provided code snippet. There are no specific checks or branches that handle infinite solutions, and the error raised suggests that only systems with a finite number of solutions are supported. Additional context or code that deals specifically with the infinite solution cases might be needed to fully address the issue.",
