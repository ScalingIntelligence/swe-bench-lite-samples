Specifically, the example provided shows that `solve_poly_system` fails to correctly handle the case where it should raise a NotImplementedError for systems with an infinite number of solutions. The patch suggests an improvement by adding a condition to check the number of generators (variables) along with the length of the univariate polynomial list. The search results include the main function `solve_poly_system`, which is responsible for solving polynomial systems, and two other functions, `solve_biquadratic` and `solve_generic`, which handle specific cases of polynomial systems. The `solve_generic` function contains the `_solve_reduced_system` method where the current NotImplementedError is raised, and this method is where the proposed change in the patch should be applied. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that cover the `solve_poly_system` function and its related methods which handle different types of polynomial systems.",
