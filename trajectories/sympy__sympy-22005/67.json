The example provided shows that when the system has an infinite number of solutions (e.g., `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)`), the function does not raise the expected NotImplementedError but instead returns a finite solution. This implies that the function needs to be enhanced to correctly detect and handle such cases. Given the context, we need to focus on the `solve_poly_system` function and associated helper functions within `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`. The analysis of the provided code sections from 'solve_poly_system', 'solve_biquadratic', and 'solve_generic' reveals that the current logic in 'solve_generic' uses a groebner basis to reduce the system of polynomials. However, it currently only raises a NotImplementedError for systems that are not zero-dimensional (finite solutions). To address the issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies infinite solution cases and raises the appropriate error. Based on the provided search results, the relevant code spans can be identified in the 'solve_poly_system' and 'solve_generic' functions, specifically where the groebner basis is used to determine the dimensionality of the solution space.",
