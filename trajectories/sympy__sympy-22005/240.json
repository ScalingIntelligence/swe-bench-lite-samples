Specifically, the user has identified a case where the function does not correctly handle a system with infinite solutions, as indicated by the provided diff snippet. The task is to identify relevant code spans within the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file that are associated with the `solve_poly_system` function and its helper functions. Analyzing the search results, we find three key spans: 'solve_poly_system', 'solve_generic', and 'solve_biquadratic'. The 'solve_poly_system' span contains the main entry point for solving polynomial systems, which is directly linked to the reported issue. The 'solve_generic' span contains the implementation of the 'solve_generic' function, which is responsible for handling generic polynomial systems and includes the '_solve_reduced_system' function that raises the 'NotImplementedError' for non-zero-dimensional systems, as mentioned in the issue. The 'solve_biquadratic' span is less directly related to the issue but is part of the broader logic within the module. Given the nature of the issue, the 'solve_poly_system' and 'solve_generic' spans are the most relevant. The 'solve_biquadratic' span, while not directly addressing the issue, is part of the logic for handling specific cases within the module and could be relevant for a complete understanding of the code. Therefore, the identified spans should primarily focus on the 'solve_poly_system' and 'solve_generic' functions.",
