The current implementation does not handle certain cases correctly, specifically when dealing with univariate systems leading to infinite solutions. The file `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` already contains the `solve_poly_system` function, and the relevant part in the patch suggests modifying a condition to handle univariate systems correctly. Additionally, there are test cases added in `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py` to ensure that the system raises `NotImplementedError` for such cases. Given this information, focusing on these files and the specific function and condition should be sufficient to address the issue.",

It shows that when given a system with a single equation `(y - 1,)`, it does not handle it correctly and returns `[(1,)]` instead of raising a `NotImplementedError`. The expected behavior is to raise a `NotImplementedError` for systems with infinite solutions.\n\n2. Review of the current file context:\nThe file context is empty, indicating that no relevant code has been identified yet.\n\n3. Process new search results:\n3.1. Analyzing each code span in the search results: The search results span multiple files including `sympy/solvers/solvers.py`, `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, `sympy/solvers/solveset.py`, `sympy/solvers/bivariate.py`, and `sympy/solvers/__init__.py`.\n3.2. Matching code spans with the reported issue: The relevant code spans seem to be in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` where the `solve_poly_system` function is defined. Specifically, the part where the implementation should raise a `NotImplementedError` for infinite solutions is of interest.\n3.3. Relevance evaluation: The `solve_poly_system` function and its related functionalities in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` are directly relevant to the issue of handling infinite solutions.\n3.7. Identified relevant code spans: Focusing on the `solve_poly_system` function in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` for managing infinite solutions.\n\nConclusion: The relevant code spans are in the `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` file, particularly the `solve_poly_system` function.",
