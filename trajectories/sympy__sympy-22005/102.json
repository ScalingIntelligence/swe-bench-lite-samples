The provided traceback suggests that the current implementation does not handle cases where there might be an infinite number of solutions. Inspecting the `solve_poly_system` function, we see that it calls `solve_biquadratic` for systems with two polynomials of degrees up to 2. If it doesn't fall into this case, it calls `solve_generic`. Within `solve_generic`, there's a specific function `_solve_reduced_system` that uses Groebner basis to reduce the system to univariate polynomials, which is then solved. The error 'only zero-dimensional systems supported' suggests that there's an assumption that the system should have a finite number of solutions. Analyzing the code, we see that the `NotImplementedError` is raised in `_solve_reduced_system` when it's not a 'zero-dimensional system.' This confirms the relevance of the code spans 'solve_poly_system' and '_solve_reduced_system' to the reported issue. The code spans indicate where the infinite solution detection should be improved or implemented.",

For now only zero-dimensional systems\n    are supported, which means F can have at most a finite number\n    of solutions.\n\n    The algorithm works by the fact that, supposing G is the basis\n    of F with respect to an elimination order  (here lexicographic\n    order is used), G and F generate the same ideal, they have the\n    same set of solutions. By the elimination property,  if G is a\n    reduced, zero-dimensional Groebner basis, then there exists an\n    univariate polynomial in G (in its last variable). This can be\n    solved by computing its roots. Substituting all computed roots\n    for the last (eliminated) variable in other elements of G, new\n    polynomial system is generated. Applying the above procedure\n    recursively, a finite number of solutions can be found.\n\n    The ability of finding all solutions by this procedure depends\n    on the root finding algorithms. If no solutions were found, it\n    means only that roots() failed, but the system is solvable. To\n    overcome this difficulty use numerical algorithms instead.\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    polys: a list/tuple/set\n        Listing all the polynomial equations that are needed to be solved\n    opt: an Options object\n        For specifying keyword arguments and generators\n\n    Returns\n    =======\n\n    List[Tuple]\n        A List of tuples.
