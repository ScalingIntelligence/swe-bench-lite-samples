The issue mentions that the query matches objects with a null value for the key on SQLite and Oracle, which should not happen. To address this, the search should focus on the specific methods that handle the `as_sqlite` and `as_oracle` behavior within the `KeyTransformIsNull` class. Additionally, the test case `test_isnull_key` in `tests.model_fields.test_jsonfield.TestQuerying` should be modified to properly catch this behavior. A search for the `KeyTransformIsNull` class and its methods, as well as the mentioned test case, is warranted to pinpoint and resolve the discrepancy.",

If isnull=True, the query should only match objects that do not have the key. The query is correct for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. However, on SQLite and Oracle, the query also matches objects that have the key with the value null, which is incorrect.\nTo confirm, edit tests.model_fields.test_jsonfield.TestQuerying.test_isnull_key. For the first assertion, change\n\t\tself.assertSequenceEqual(\n\t\t\tNullableJSONModel.objects.filter(value__a__isnull=True),\n\t\t\tself.objs[:3] + self.objs[5:],\n\t\t)\nto\n\t\tself.assertSequenceEqual(\n\t\t\tNullableJSONModel.objects.filter(value__j__isnull=True),\n\t\t\tself.objs[:4] + self.objs[5:],\n\t\t)\nThe test previously only checks with value__a which could not catch this behavior because the value is not JSON null.\n"
