The issue noted that instead of a technical response, a generic server error message is displayed. This suggests that the code responsible for handling Http404 exceptions and providing debug information might be relevant.\n\nI then reviewed the current file context, which was empty, indicating no relevant code had been identified yet.\n\nNext, I proceeded to analyze the search results. I identified several key sections of code that are likely relevant to the issue:\n1. In `django/urls/resolvers.py`, the `RoutePattern.match` method includes handling for converters and raising a ValueError. This is potentially where the path converter's to_python method is used and where a Http404 could be raised.\n2. Also in `django/urls/resolvers.py`, the `URLResolver.resolve` method is responsible for resolving URLs and includes handling for Resolver404, which is likely where the Http404 exception would be managed.\n3. In `django/views/debug.py`, the `technical_404_response` function is specifically designed to provide a detailed 404 response when DEBUG is True. This function is likely to be involved in displaying the correct debug information when a Http404 is raised.\n4. In `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, the `response_for_exception` function handles various exceptions, including Http404, and decides whether to display a debug response based on the DEBUG setting.\n\nBased on this analysis, I identified these sections of code as relevant to the reported issue concerning Http404 handling and debug responses.",
