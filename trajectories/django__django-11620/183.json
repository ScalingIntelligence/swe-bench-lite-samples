The goal is to ensure that when DEBUG is True, raising an Http404 should result in a more informative error response rather than the default technical response. The relevant components to investigate include the path converter classes and methods, the exception handling mechanisms (especially how Http404 is treated), and the debug response mechanisms. Looking into the converters.py for the to_python method implementations, the resolvers.py for how URL resolution handles exceptions, and the debug.py for the technical response handling would be logical steps. Additionally, considering the integration with the shortcuts module where get_object_or_404 is defined could offer insights into how to achieve the desired behavior for path converters using this method.",

The goal is to ensure that raising `Http404` results in a technical response instead of a generic server error message. To address this, we need to identify code spans related to URL pattern resolution, path conversion, and handling of `Http404` exceptions in debug mode. We have identified several relevant code spans across different files:\n\n1. **django/urls/converters.py**: This file contains definitions of various path converters, including `StringConverter`, `UUIDConverter`, and `PathConverter`. The `to_python` methods for these converters are defined here, which are directly related to the conversion of path segments to Python objects.\n\n2. **django/urls/resolvers.py**: This file is crucial for URL pattern resolution. It contains the `URLPattern` and `URLResolver` classes, which handle the matching of URLs to their respective views. The `resolve` method in `URLResolver` is particularly relevant, as it raises `Resolver404` which is used to handle 404 errors.\n\n3. **django/views/debug.py**: This file contains the `technical_404_response` function, which is responsible for generating a detailed 404 response when `DEBUG` is `True`. This function is directly involved in producing the desired technical response.\n\n4. **django/shortcuts.py**: This file contains the `get_object_or_404` function, which is often used in views to fetch objects or raise `Http404` if the objects are not found. While this function is not directly related to path converters, it demonstrates how `Http404` is typically raised and handled.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans include those related to path conversion (`django/urls/converters.py`), URL resolution and `Resolver404` handling (`django/urls/resolvers.py`), and the generation of technical 404 responses (`django/views/debug.py`). These code spans together provide a comprehensive view of how `Http404` is handled during URL resolution and how a technical response can be enabled when `DEBUG` is `True`.",

The current response is a plain text message 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.' which is not helpful. The issue suggests that raising a Http404 should result in a more informative error message when DEBUG is True.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Relevant Files and Code Spans:**\n   - **django/urls/converters.py:** Contains various converter classes like StringConverter, UUIDConverter, and PathConverter, each with a to_python method. These methods are crucial for type conversion of URL path components.\n   - **django/urls/resolvers.py:** Contains the URLResolver and URLPattern classes, which are responsible for mapping URLs to their corresponding views. Specifically, the resolve method in URLResolver is where URL resolution occurs.\n   - **django/views/debug.py:** Contains the technical_404_response function, which generates the debug response for 404 errors. This function should be modified to provide a more detailed response when DEBUG is True.\n\n2. **Identified Relevant Code Spans:**\n   - **django/urls/converters.py:** The to_python methods in StringConverter, UUIDConverter, and PathConverter.\n   - **django/urls/resolvers.py:** The resolve method in URLResolver.\n   - **django/views/debug.py:** The technical_404_response function.\n\n3. **Considerations:**\n   - The to_python methods need to ensure that if a Http404 is raised, it should propagate correctly to the resolver logic.\n   - The resolve method in URLResolver should handle the Http404 exception and pass it along to the appropriate handler.\n   - The technical_404_response function in debug.py should be adapted to provide a more detailed response when DEBUG is True.\n\nBy focusing on these specific areas, we can address the issue of providing a more informative error message when Http404 is raised during path conversion.",

The current behavior is not resulting in a technical response as expected. The provided file context and search results show various parts of the Django framework that are related to URL resolving, path converters, and the handling of Http404 exceptions. The search results include additional implementations of converters like IntConverter and the mechanisms for resolving URLs within the URLPattern and URLResolver classes. The core of the issue seems to be the handling of exceptions within the URL resolving process, particularly in the URLResolver.resolve method and the technical_404_response function. The identified spans in the search results provide a comprehensive view of how path converters and URL resolvers are designed, which is crucial for understanding and addressing the issue. Based on the provided context and search results, it seems that further investigation into the exception handling within the URLResolver.resolve method and the technical_404_response function is necessary to determine the exact points of intervention for implementing the desired behavior.",
