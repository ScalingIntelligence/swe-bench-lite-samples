The expected behavior is to get a more technical response, but instead, a generic message 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.' is received. This indicates that the handling of Http404 exceptions in the path conversion process might not be correctly configured to provide detailed debug information when DEBUG is True. To address this, we need to look into the code sections where Http404 exceptions are handled in the URL resolution process, especially focusing on the to_python method of path converters and the exception handling middleware or functions. Additionally, it would be helpful to check if there are specific configurations or customizations that might affect the behavior of the debug response for Http404.",

The current response is a generic server error message instead of a more detailed one expected in DEBUG mode. To address this, we should identify the areas in the codebase where Http404 is handled and ensure that detailed messages are provided when DEBUG is True.\n\nFrom the search results, there are several relevant files and code spans:\n\n1. **django/urls/exceptions.py** - This file defines the Resolver404 and NoReverseMatch exceptions. Resolver404 is a subclass of Http404, which is relevant as it could be the exception being caught and handled elsewhere in the code.\n\n2. **django/urls/converters.py** - This file contains the implementation of various path converters, including the StringConverter and UUIDConverter classes, and their to_python methods. This is directly relevant as the issue mentions raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method.\n\n3. **django/middleware/common.py** - This file contains the CommonMiddleware class, which processes responses and handles redirects for URLs not found (404 status code). It is relevant as it could be where the generic error message is being set for Http404 errors.\n\n4. **django/middleware/locale.py** - This file contains the LocaleMiddleware class, which also processes responses and handles language prefix patterns. It's not as directly relevant but could still be part of the response handling pipeline.\n\n5. **django/urls/resolvers.py** - This file contains the URLResolver class, which is responsible for resolving URLs and handling Resolver404 exceptions. It is highly relevant as it directly deals with the resolving process and exception handling.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans should help in addressing the issue by providing a starting point for modifying the response handling for Http404 exceptions when DEBUG is True.",

Specifically, the Resolver404 class in django/urls/exceptions.py is a subclass of Http404, indicating how custom 404 exceptions might be handled. Additionally, the to_python methods in django/urls/converters.py demonstrate typical behavior for path converters, suggesting where an exception like Http404 could be raised. The CommonMiddleware class in django/middleware/common.py shows how responses are processed, including handling of 404 status codes, which could be relevant if there's a need to modify debug output for 404 errors. Lastly, the URLResolver class in django/urls/resolvers.py contains the resolve method, which handles URL pattern matching and includes exception handling for Resolver404. This suggests the critical area where raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method might impact the debug response. Given the scope of the provided files, it appears they cover the necessary aspects of the Django framework related to the reported issue.",
