The search results from 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' contain several key spans that are highly relevant to this issue: \n\n1. The 'imports' span includes the import of 'Http404', which is central to the issue. \n2. The 'response_for_exception' span directly addresses the handling of Http404 exceptions, including the conditional check for 'settings.DEBUG'. When DEBUG is True, 'debug.technical_404_response' is called, which aligns perfectly with the expectation of a more informative error message in development. This span also handles different types of exceptions, but its relevance is especially high due to its direct connection to Http404 and DEBUG settings. \n3. The presence of 'convert_exception_to_response' and 'get_exception_response' spans, while not directly modifying the Http404 behavior under DEBUG, are part of the exception handling framework and justify further review to ensure comprehensive understanding of the exception flow. \n4. The 'handle_uncaught_exception' span, although not directly related to Http404, is relevant to the broader context of exceptions and the DEBUG setting, as it too checks 'settings.DEBUG' for uncaught exceptions.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are directly responsive to the reported issue, ensuring a technical response when raising Http404 while DEBUG is True.",

  "initial_message": "When DEBUG is True, raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method does not result in a technical response\nDescription\n\t\nThis is the response I get (plain text): \nA server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
