The desired behavior is to get a technical response instead of the default 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.'

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is concerned with the handling of Http404 exceptions in the path converters' `to_python` method. It seems that when DEBUG is True, raising Http404 does not result in a technical response causing a misleading error message. The focus should be on identifying the handling mechanism for Http404 exceptions and how DEBUG status influences the response in the context of URL resolving. I'll analyze the provided code for handling Http404, especially around the sections where DEBUG status is considered and response generation is defined. I will also look for any references to 'Http404' or 'DEBUG' across the code spans to pinpoint the relevant parts.\n\nThe search results contain multiple files: 'django/urls/converters.py', 'django/views/debug.py', and 'django/core/handlers/exception.py'. The first file has class definitions and their methods which might be used in URL conversion. We have methods named 'to_python' in various converter classes like 'IntConverter', 'StringConverter', 'UUIDConverter', etc. However, none of them specifically handle or raise Http404. The methods are primarily focused on type conversion from URL string to Python objects. The second file, 'django/views/debug.py', is likely relevant because it imports 'Http404' and contains code spans like 'technical_404_response' which shows they manipulate a 404 response related to debugging. This may influence the Http404 handling based on the DEBUG setting. Furthermore, the 'response_for_exception' function in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' is a good candidate for scrutiny since it processes exceptions, checks the type of the exception (including Http404), and evaluates the DEBUG setting configuration for determining the appropriate response. These sections are definitely pertinent but also need corroborating spans that link Http404 with modifying URL resolver behavior based on the DEBUG status.\n\nFor this, 'django/urls/resolvers.py' contains a 'URLResolver' class that appears to control URL resolving which may tie back to the initial problem. This class has method 'resolve' which throws 'Resolver404' that may need to be modified, especially taking into account the DEBUG environment.\n\nFrom the initial assessment, the relevant sections involving Http404 handling are identified in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' under the 'response_for_exception' method, and in 'django/views/debug.py' around 'technical_404_response'. Additionally, 'django/urls/resolvers.py' has links to URL resolving and its relation to Http404 exceptions.",

Additionally, the 'debug.py' file includes the implementation of 'technical_404_response' which is responsible for rendering the technical 404 page when DEBUG is True.
