The desired outcome is to receive a technical response detailing the error, which currently does not happen, resulting in a generic 'server error' message. The search should focus on Django's URL resolver and exception handling mechanisms, particularly around Http404 and path converters. The files provided in the context suggest that relevant code might be in django/urls/{converters,resolvers}.py, django/views/{defaults,debug}.py, and django/core/handlers/exception.py. Key elements to look for include the handling of Http404 in URL resolution and the exception response generation in debug mode.",

The user expects a more informative error message instead of the default 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.'. The analysis of the provided codebase indicates that the relevant sections can be found in three primary files: 'django/urls/converters.py', 'django/urls/resolvers.py', and 'django/views/debug.py'. These files contain methods related to URL conversion, resolving URL patterns, and handling technical debug responses respectively. Specifically, the 'PathConverter' class in 'django/urls/converters.py' is relevant as it extends 'StringConverter' and is used for handling path parameters in URLs. In 'django/urls/resolvers.py', the 'URLResolver' class is central to URL pattern resolution which can potentially handle Http404 exceptions. Finally, in 'django/views/debug.py', there are functions for generating technical 404 and 500 responses which are crucial for displaying detailed debug information when DEBUG is True. The 'response_for_exception' function in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' also plays a role in handling exceptions, including Http404, and determining the appropriate response, making it relevant. These sections provide the necessary context to understand and possibly address the issue regarding the handling of Http404 exceptions in path converters during debug mode.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
