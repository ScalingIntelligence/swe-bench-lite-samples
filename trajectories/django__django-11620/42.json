The user expects that raising Http404 should result in a more informative technical response rather than a generic server error message. This requires examining how Http404 exceptions are processed in Django's URL resolving mechanism and how DEBUG mode affects the response.\n\nFrom the search results, the key files identified are 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/views/debug.py'. These files contain critical logic for URL resolving and debug responses. Specifically, '_get_cached_resolver', 'get_ns_resolver', 'URLResolver', and 'URLResolver.resolve' in 'resolvers.py' deal with URL pattern matching and exception handling. In 'debug.py', 'technical_404_response' is directly related to how 404 errors are rendered in DEBUG mode.\n\nGiven the user's issue, the relevant spans in 'resolvers.py' seem to be those handling the URL resolving process and exception raising (spans 'URLResolver.resolve' and 'URLResolver.__init__'). In 'debug.py', the span 'technical_404_response' is crucial as it constructs the technical 404 response. Additionally, although not directly related to Http404 handling, 'django/http/response.py' contains HttpResponse classes, which might be consulted further if the issue involves response processing.\n\nThus, the identified spans are likely relevant to resolving the issue, focusing on how Http404 exceptions interact with Django's DEBUG mode response handling.",
