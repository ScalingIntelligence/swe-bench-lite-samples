The goal is to ensure that a more technical response is provided instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns' message. The search results encompass several key areas: the URLResolver class which handles URL resolution, the handling of exceptions including Http404 in django/core/handlers/exception.py, and the converters in django/urls/converters.py where the to_python method resides. It's crucial to identify where Http404 might be raised and how the system responds to it. The main focus should be on the URLResolver.resolve method which attempts to match a URL path and can raise Resolver404. Additionally, the response_for_exception function in django/core/handlers/exception.py determines the response type based on the exception caught, and has specific handling for Http404 when DEBUG is True. These areas are critical for understanding how to improve the error handling and potentially modify the behavior when Http404 is raised in a converter's to_python method to provide a more detailed error message during debugging.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
