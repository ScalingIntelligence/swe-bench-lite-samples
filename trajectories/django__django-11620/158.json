The search results provide insights into the Django URL resolution and exception handling mechanisms. The key components identified include: 1. URLResolver class in `django/urls/resolvers.py` which is responsible for URL pattern matching and resolution. 2. Converters in `django/urls/converters.py` such as IntConverter, StringConverter, and UUIDConverter, which handle the conversion of path variables to Python objects. 3. Exception handling in `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, specifically `convert_exception_to_response` and `response_for_exception` which manage how exceptions are converted to HTTP responses. 4. Detailed debug responses in `django/views/debug.py` with `technical_404_response`, which should be triggered when Http404 is raised and DEBUG is True. These components are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of Http404 handling within Django. Reviewing the entire sections of `URLResolver.resolve`, `convert_exception_to_response`, and `technical_404_response` ensures a comprehensive understanding of the code's flow and decision points related to the issue.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
