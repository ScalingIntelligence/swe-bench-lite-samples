The current behavior results in a plain text message: 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.' The user suggests that raising Http404 should be a valid way to tell the resolver that the current parameter value does not match anything and should stop and let the handler return the 404 page, with a helpful error message when DEBUG is True.\n\nFrom the provided context, it's clear that the issue is related to the URL resolution process in Django. The file 'django/urls/resolvers.py' contains several key classes and methods involved in URL resolving, such as ResolverMatch, RoutePattern, and URLResolver. The methods such as RoutePattern.match and URLResolver.resolve are critical as they handle how URL matching occurs and how the resolver processes paths.\n\nIn 'django/views/debug.py', the function 'technical_404_response' is relevant as it generates the technical response for a 404 error when DEBUG is True. This function is responsible for rendering a detailed 404 response page, which includes information about the attempted URL patterns.\n\nThe new search results from 'django/urls/converters.py' show various converter classes such as IntConverter, StringConverter, UUIDConverter, and PathConverter. These converters are used in the URL pattern matching process to convert URL path components to Python objects. Methods like 'to_python' in these converters are particularly relevant because they handle the conversion process and can potentially raise Http404 or ValueError.\n\nBased on all these details, the relevant code spans are those that deal with URL resolving, handling 404 errors, and converting path components in the URL pattern matching process. Specifically, the methods 'RoutePattern.match', 'URLResolver.resolve', 'technical_404_response', and 'to_python' methods in the converter classes are key to addressing the reported issue.",

Specifically, the to_python methods in UUIDConverter and StringConverter should be reviewed to ensure they handle exceptions properly and that these exceptions are appropriately propagated through the URL resolution process. Additionally, attention should be given to the URLResolver's resolve method in 'django/urls/resolvers.py', which handles the URL pattern matching and resolution. This method should manage intercepted exceptions like Resolver404 to ensure that they result in the appropriate response. Furthermore, the get_object_or_404 function in 'django/shortcuts.py' might influence error handling within these path converters if used within their methods, particularly when attempting to fetch objects that may result in a Http404. Therefore, reviewing these interconnected components is crucial to understanding how raising a Http404 within a to_python method impacts the overall request handling process.",
