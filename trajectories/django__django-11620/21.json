The expected behavior is to get a more detailed error message, but instead, a generic 'server error' message is received. To address this, we need to inspect the handling of Http404 exceptions, particularly in the context of path converters and URL resolution. Relevant files include those handling exceptions and URL resolution, such as `django/urls/exceptions.py`, `django/urls/resolvers.py`, `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, and `django/views/debug.py`.",

The issue implies that the current behavior does not provide a detailed technical response, which is expected during debugging. Here's the step-by-step analysis of the provided search results:\n\n1. **django/urls/resolvers.py** - This file contains the main URL resolving logic. The 'URLResolver.resolve' span is relevant because it attempts to resolve a URL and handles exceptions like Resolver404, which extends Http404.\n\n2. **django/urls/exceptions.py** - This file defines the Resolver404 exception, which is a subclass of Http404. Understanding how exceptions in Django are structured will help us determine the appropriate place to modify or extend behavior.\n\n3. **django/core/handlers/exception.py** - This file is crucial as it contains the logic for converting exceptions into responses. The 'response_for_exception' span specifically handles Http404 exceptions and uses the 'debug.technical_404_response' function when settings.DEBUG is True.\n\n4. **django/views/debug.py** - The 'technical_404_response' function is defined here, which generates a detailed response for Http404 errors when in debug mode. This function will be key to ensuring that the detailed error message is shown as expected.\n\nCombining these pieces of information, we can see a clear path for how Django handles Http404 exceptions and how the debug-specific response is generated. The relevant code spans are those that either throw or catch Http404 exceptions and those that specifically handle such exceptions in debug mode. These identified spans directly align with the elements discussed in the user's issue description, specifically the role of DEBUG settings and the desired detailed error response.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
