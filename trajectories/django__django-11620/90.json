The expected behavior is to get a technical response, but instead, a generic server error message is received. It is suggested that raising Http404 should inform the resolver that the current parameter value does not match anything, and it should stop processing and return a 404 page with a helpful error message when DEBUG is True. This might involve modifications in the URL resolving mechanism and how exceptions are handled during URL resolution.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the handling of Http404 exceptions when DEBUG is set to True, specifically in the context of a path converter's to_python method. The user expects a more technical response instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns'. After reviewing the provided search results, the following observations can be made:\n\n1. The file `django/urls/converters.py` contains definitions of different converters, including `IntConverter`, `StringConverter`, and `UUIDConverter`, each with a `to_python` method. These methods are responsible for converting captured segments of the URL to the appropriate Python datatypes. Although the issue mentions Http404, it does not appear these converters currently raise Http404 directly.\n\n2. The file `django/core/handlers/exception.py` includes logic for converting exceptions to HTTP responses, specifically the `response_for_exception` function. This function checks if the exception is an instance of Http404 and then constructs a response based on the DEBUG setting. If DEBUG is True, it uses `debug.technical_404_response` to generate a more technical response.\n\n3. The `debug.technical_404_response` function, found in `django/views/debug.py`, is responsible for generating the detailed 404 response when DEBUG is True. This function prepares a technical 404 response by rendering a template with detailed information about the request and the specific path that resulted in the 404 error.\n\n4. The `page_not_found` function in `django/views/defaults.py` is also relevant as it handles the default 404 response when a custom template is not provided. However, this function does not directly relate to the DEBUG setting.\n\nBased on these observations, the code spans identified directly relate to the logic handling Http404 exceptions when DEBUG is True, which aligns well with the reported issue. Therefore, these spans should be identified as relevant.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
