Please contact the administrator.' The search results include several relevant files and functions. In 'django/urls/converters.py', the `to_python` methods for different converters (IntConverter, StringConverter, UUIDConverter) are found, which handle conversion of URL parameters to Python objects. These methods could potentially raise Http404 if the parameter doesn't match expected patterns. In 'django/core/handlers/exception.py', the `convert_exception_to_response` and `response_for_exception` functions are crucial for handling exceptions during request processing, including Http404. Specifically, `response_for_exception` checks if the exception is an Http404 and if DEBUG is True, it calls `debug.technical_404_response`. In 'django/views/debug.py', the `technical_404_response` function is defined to provide a detailed response for Http404 errors when DEBUG is True, showing the URL patterns tried and other technical details. This function is directly relevant to the issue, as it is responsible for the technical response that the user expects. Thus, the relevant code spans are identified in these files and functions.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
