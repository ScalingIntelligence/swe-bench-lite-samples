Specifically, it suggests that raising Http404 should provide a more helpful error message during debugging. Key points from the issue include the expectation that raising Http404 should stop resolution and return a 404 page with a better error message under DEBUG mode. This could be useful for path converters using `get_object_or_404` for object retrieval. \n\nFrom the provided search results, several relevant code spans were found within `django/urls/converters.py`, `django/urls/resolvers.py`, and `django/views/debug.py`. These code spans outline the functionality of path converters and URL resolvers, including how they handle resolution and exceptions such as Http404. Notably, the `technical_404_response` function in `django/views/debug.py` handles the rendering of a technical 404 response, which is particularly relevant to the issue's request for better error messages under DEBUG. Additionally, the `URLResolver` and `URLPattern` classes in `django/urls/resolvers.py` show how URL resolution is managed and how exceptions like `Resolver404` are handled, indicating potential points for modification to better handle and report Http404 exceptions when DEBUG is True.\n\nFurther analysis is needed to determine if any additional relevant code spans exist beyond those provided.

The expected behavior is to receive a helpful error message instead of the default 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator'. The issue suggests that raising Http404 should be a valid way to tell the resolver that the current parameter value does not match anything, thus stopping the process and letting the handler return the 404 page with a helpful error message in DEBUG mode.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, the main focus should be on the handling of Http404 exceptions in the URL resolution process, specifically in the 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/views/debug.py' files. These files contain critical functions and classes related to URL resolution (URLResolver, URLPattern) and the handling of technical 404 responses (technical_404_response).\n\nIn the search results, the 'django/urls/resolvers.py' file is especially relevant because it includes the URLResolver and URLPattern classes which are central to the URL resolution process. Notably, the URLResolver.resolve method and the handling of Resolver404 exceptions within this method are directly related to the issue. The method tries to resolve the URL path and handles Resolver404 exceptions by raising a new Resolver404 exception that includes detailed information about the tried patterns and path.\n\nThe 'django/views/debug.py' file also contains important code relevant to the issue. Specifically, the technical_404_response function is designed to handle technical 404 responses in debug mode. This function constructs a detailed 404 response providing information about the URL conf, request path, and URL patterns tried, among other things. This function directly addresses the requirement for a more helpful error message when DEBUG is True.\n\nBased on the analysis of the reported issue and the content of the provided files, the identified 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/views/debug.py' files are highly relevant to solving the issue. The relevant code spans within these files include the URLResolver.resolve method for handling Resolver404 exceptions and the technical_404_response function for generating helpful 404 responses.",
