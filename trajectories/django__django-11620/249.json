The code should identify where Http404 is raised and investigate the behavior in relation to DEBUG mode. Focusing on the `django/urls/converters.py` file is a good starting point as it contains the to_python method. Additionally, the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file should be examined to understand how URL resolution handles such exceptions. The `django/core/handlers/exception.py` file is also relevant for understanding the global exception handling behavior. The `django/views/debug.py` file might contain specifics about how debug responses are generated.",

The desired outcome is to have a technical response instead of the default 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.' message. The search results contain several relevant files and methods:\n\n1. `django/urls/converters.py` - This file contains the definitions of various path converters, including `StringConverter` and `PathConverter`. The `to_python` method of these converters is responsible for converting the matched path component to a Python object. This is a likely place where the Http404 exception could be raised.\n\n2. `django/urls/resolvers.py` - This file is responsible for resolving URLs and contains the `URLResolver` class. The `resolve` method of this class is where the URL matching process takes place. This is relevant because it might handle the Http404 exception and decide how to respond.\n\n3. `django/core/handlers/exception.py` - This file contains handlers for exceptions, including `convert_exception_to_response` and `response_for_exception`. These methods are responsible for converting exceptions into appropriate HTTP responses. This is relevant because it will determine the response when an Http404 exception is raised.\n\n4. `django/views/debug.py` - This file contains debug-related views, including `technical_404_response`. This method is likely responsible for generating the technical response when DEBUG is True, which is what the user is looking for.\n\nBased on these considerations, the identified spans in the search results are relevant to the reported issue and can provide insights into how the Http404 exception is handled and how to modify its behavior when DEBUG is True.",

These files contain the classes and methods that deal with URL resolving, exception handling, and debug response generation.\n\nThe new search results include additional details in the 'to_python' methods of 'IntConverter' and 'UUIDConverter', which could be relevant if those converters are used in a way similar to the PathConverter. The 'resolve' and 'resolve_error_handler' methods in 'URLResolver' are also present in the new search results, reinforcing the relevance of these parts for understanding URL resolving and error handling. The 'response_for_exception' and 'handle_uncaught_exception' methods in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' are central to the exception handling and debug response mechanism, and their presence in the new search results confirms their relevance.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans in the new search results are relevant and provide more context around the key elements identified in the reported issue.

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
