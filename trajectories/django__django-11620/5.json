This indicates a need to look at how Http404 exceptions are handled and how the DEBUG mode affects the error reporting. The search results provide several relevant code spans: in `django/urls/resolvers.py`, there are spans for `URLResolver` and its methods, which might handle the resolution and the exceptions raised; in `django/views/debug.py`, there's a `technical_404_response` function that could be responsible for generating detailed 404 responses when DEBUG is True; and in `django/http/response.py`, there's the definition of `Http404` which suggests the base handling of this exception. These sections of code are critical for addressing the issue, as they involve exception handling, URL resolving, and error response generation.
