The search results provide insights into the Django URL converters, particularly the `PathConverter` class which extends the `StringConverter`. This class is relevant as it directly relates to URL path conversion, which is central to the issue. The method or logic for handling the Http404 exception within these converters is not immediately visible in the provided code spans. However, understanding the structure and classes involved is crucial for further investigation into where and how Http404 exceptions are handled in the context of URL resolution and debugging. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on classes like `PathConverter` is a good starting point to dig deeper into the internals of how path conversion and exception handling are integrated in Django.",

The issue suggests that raising Http404 should be a valid way to inform the resolver that the current parameter value does not match anything, leading to a 404 page with a helpful error message when DEBUG is True.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, we need to identify relevant code spans that deal with Http404 handling and debug mode specifically. The context already shows some converters, notably 'PathConverter', which might be related to the issue.\n\nFrom the search results, several spans are relevant:\n- 'ExceptionReporter.get_traceback_html' and 'ExceptionReporter.get_traceback_text' in django/views/debug.py: These handle the generation of technical error responses, which should be relevant when DEBUG is True.\n- 'technical_404_response' in django/views/debug.py: This function is directly related to the 404 error handling, especially in DEBUG mode.\n- 'response_for_exception' and 'get_exception_response' in django/core/handlers/exception.py: These deal with exception handling, including Http404, and are crucial for understanding how exceptions are managed and responded to.\n- 'URLResolver.resolve' and related methods in django/urls/resolvers.py: These handle URL resolution, which is directly tied to path converters and their exceptions.\n\nThese spans should provide a comprehensive overview of the current handling of Http404 in DEBUG mode and how the URL resolution process manages exceptions.",
