This includes `convert_exception_to_response`, `response_for_exception`, and `technical_404_response`, which directly address the handling of Http404 exceptions and the generation of technical responses. These functions and classes are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying Django's behavior concerning the reported issue.\n\nThe identified code spans are relevant because they cover the core functionalities related to the issue: handling exceptions, processing Http404 exceptions, and generating detailed technical responses.
