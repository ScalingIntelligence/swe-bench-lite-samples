The current response is a generic server error message instead of a more informative technical response.

Specifically, we should focus on the files related to exception handling and URL resolution to ensure that Http404 exceptions are properly converted to a more informative response when DEBUG is True. We should also consider whether custom error handlers or middleware might be affecting this behavior.",
