The expected behavior is to get a technical response, but instead, a generic error message is received. This suggests that the handling of Http404 exceptions in debug mode might not be properly implemented or configured. To address this, I need to focus on the code related to exception handling, specifically for Http404, and the path converter's `to_python` method. Searching for the files and specific functions or classes involved in this process will help in identifying the root cause.",

This involves understanding how Django handles Http404 exceptions and the debug responses in the context of URL resolution and error handling. The search results provide several key sections of code that are relevant to this issue, particularly in the context of error handling and debug responses. Here's the analysis:\n\n1. **django/views/debug.py**: This file contains the `technical_404_response` and `technical_500_response` functions, which are central to how Django handles technical debug responses for 404 and 500 errors. These functions are essential to investigate since the issue specifically relates to the behavior when DEBUG is True.\n\n2. **django/core/handlers/exception.py**: This file contains the `response_for_exception` function, which determines the response to return for different types of exceptions, including Http404. Understanding how this function decides on whether to return a technical response or a standard 404 response is crucial.\n\n3. **django/urls/resolvers.py**: This file deals with URL resolution and contains the logic for handling URL patterns and resolving URLs to view functions. Although not directly about error handling, understanding URL resolution can help in understanding the broader context in which Http404 errors might be raised.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the analysis of the relevant code sections, the identified spans are focused on the error handling and debug response mechanisms in Django.
