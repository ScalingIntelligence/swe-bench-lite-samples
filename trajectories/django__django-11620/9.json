The current implementation does not provide a technical response when DEBUG is True. The search results indicate relevant sections in Django's URL handling and exception processing: \n\n1. ** django/urls/converters.py **: Contains the implementation of path converters, including `IntConverter`, `StringConverter`, and `UUIDConverter`. Specifically, the `to_python` method is defined for each converter. This is relevant as it sets the context for where the Http404 exception might be raised. \n\n2. ** django/urls/resolvers.py **: Includes the `URLPattern` and `URLResolver` classes. These are crucial for understanding how the URL resolution process works in Django, particularly the `resolve` method which is responsible for finding the correct view or handler for a given URL path. The `raise Resolver404` statements are critical to the issue, as they indicate how Django handles path mismatches or errors. \n\n3. ** django/core/handlers/exception.py **: This file contains the exception handling logic, including `convert_exception_to_response`, `response_for_exception`, and `handle_uncaught_exception`. The `response_for_exception` specifically addresses the handling of Http404 exceptions and the use of `debug.technical_404_response` when DEBUG is True. This directly addresses the concern of the reported issue, showing where and how the response for Http404 is generated.\nThe identified spans coverthe key parts of the codebase needed to understand and potentially modify the behavior of raising Http404 in path converters under DEBUG mode.",

However, the response to Http404 in debug mode, which is handled in response_for_exception, currently provides a non-technical response. Therefore, while the functionality around raising and handling Http404 is present, there's room for considering how to provide a technical response when DEBUG is True.

This suggests a need to investigate how Http404 exceptions are handled and converted to responses. The current context provides relevant files and spans of code from Django's URL resolution and exception handling modules. The new search results reaffirm this focus, containing duplicates of the previously identified spans and additional context needed to understand the flow of URL resolution and exception handling in Django. Specifically, the relevant code spans include the URLPattern and URLResolver classes in resolvers.py, which handle the resolution process, and the exception handling functions in exception.py, which dictate how various types of exceptions are converted to HTTP responses. Given the detailed examination, it's evident that the identified code spans are crucial for addressing the issue, as they directly pertain to URL resolution and exception handling, which are central to the problem at hand.",
