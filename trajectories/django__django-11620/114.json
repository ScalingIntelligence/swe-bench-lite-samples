To address this, it's important to identify the relevant parts of the Django URL resolving mechanism that handle the Http404 exception and the DEBUG mode. From the provided search results, the URLResolver class and its methods, particularly those involved in resolving paths and handling errors (like resolve, resolve_error_handler, and _check_custom_error_handlers), seem highly relevant. Additionally, the URLPattern class and its resolve method are crucial as they deal directly with matching URLs and can raise Http404. These sections of the code are pivotal for understanding how to modify the behavior for more informative error messages during debugging.",

The expected behavior is to get a technical response, but instead, a generic error message is received. This suggests a need to investigate how Http404 exceptions are handled in the URL resolver and path converter contexts, especially focusing on the technical_404_response function and the URLResolver class. After analyzing the provided file context, I observed that the URLResolver class is indeed present and contains logic for handling URL resolution and error handling. However, the specific method or code that deals directly with the Http404 exception's behavior in DEBUG mode was not immediately apparent. Given the complexity and depth of the URLResolver class, it's possible there may be additional relevant methods or functionalities within the Django framework not covered in the provided file context.",

The file context provided suggests that the 'technical_404_response' function might be involved in producing technical responses for 404 errors when DEBUG mode is active. Additionally, the URLResolver class plays a key role in resolving URL patterns and handling exceptions like Resolver404. Further investigation is warranted to ensure that Http404 exceptions raised in path converters during DEBUG mode are appropriately handled with technical responses rather than generic error messages. This involves examining how exceptions flow through the URL resolution process and how they are ultimately presented to the user in DEBUG mode.",
