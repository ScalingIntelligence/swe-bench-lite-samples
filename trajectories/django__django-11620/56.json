The current behavior results in a generic error message that does not provide detailed information, especially useful for debugging. To address this, we need to identify the parts of the codebase that deal with path conversion, URL resolution, and exception handling when Http404 is raised. The search results provided cover the required areas such as the `to_python` methods in path converters (`IntConverter`, `StringConverter`, `UUIDConverter`), the URL resolver logic in `resolvers.py`, and the exception handling in `exception.py` which includes `convert_exception_to_response` and `response_for_exception`. Specifically, the `technical_404_response` function in `debug.py` is crucial as it controls the detailed 404 response seen when DEBUG is True. This function is where improvements to provide a more helpful error message should be implemented.\n\nAnalyzing the relevance of each span based on the issue:\n- The `convert_exception_to_response` function and its inner `response_for_exception` are directly responsible for converting exceptions into responses, including handling Http404 exceptions. This is highly relevant to ensure the correct response is shown when DEBUG is True.\n- The `technical_404_response` function in `debug.py` is directly involved in generating the debug response for a 404 error. Modifying this function could provide the detailed, technical response needed when DEBUG is True.\n- The `resolve` method in `URLResolver` and the `to_python` methods in the converters are relevant as they are the parts of the code that might raise an Http404 in the context of URL resolution and path parameter conversion, respectively.\n\nThese code spans are critical in addressing the issue and would need to be modified or further built upon to implement the desired behavior change as described in the reported issue.",
