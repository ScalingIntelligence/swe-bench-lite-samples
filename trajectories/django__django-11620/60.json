The focus is on understanding how Http404 is handled in Django when DEBUG is True and how this affects the path conversion process. The search results provide relevant code spans mainly from three files: django/urls/converters.py, django/core/handlers/exception.py, and django/views/debug.py. These files contain classes and methods related to URL conversion, exception handling, and debug response generation. Specifically, the PathConverter class in django/urls/converters.py extends StringConverter and is likely related to the path conversion process mentioned in the issue. In django/core/handlers/exception.py, the response_for_exception function handles Http404 exceptions, determining the response based on the DEBUG setting. This directly relates to the issue's concern about the behavior when DEBUG is True. The technical_404_response function in django/views/debug.py generates the technical response for 404 errors when DEBUG is True, which is crucial for understanding the expected behavior described in the issue. These code spans are highly relevant as they deal directly with the handling of Http404 in a DEBUG environment and the generation of technical responses for 404 errors.",
