I've identified several relevant spans across multiple files that deal with URL resolving, converters, and exception handling, especially when an Http404 is raised. These include the URLResolver class and its methods in resolvers.py, the to_python method implementations in converters.py, the HttpResponseNotFound class in response.py, and the handling of Http404 in exception.py.",

Additionally, 'django/views/debug.py' contains the 'technical_404_response' function that generates a detailed 404 response when DEBUG is True. This aligns with the issue's requirement for a more informative response. The converters in 'django/urls/converters.py' are also relevant as they handle path parsing, which could potentially raise Http404 under the right conditions.

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
