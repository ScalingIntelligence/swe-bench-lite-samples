The search results provided include several relevant files and spans of code. First, 'django/urls/converters.py' contains a collection of converters including IntConverter, StringConverter, and UUIDConverter, all of which have a to_python method that converts the matched pattern into a Python object. However, none of these methods currently raise Http404. Next, 'django/urls/resolvers.py' contains the URLResolver and URLPattern classes, which handle the resolution of URLs and patterns. The URLResolver class' 'resolve' method attempts to match the path against URL patterns and handles Resolver404 exceptions. Meanwhile, 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' handles the conversion of exceptions to HTTP responses, including Http404. The 'response_for_exception' function checks if the exception is an instance of Http404 and, if DEBUG is True, calls 'technical_404_response'. Finally, 'django/views/debug.py' includes the 'technical_404_response' function that returns a detailed 404 response when DEBUG is True. To address the issue, code related to handling and responding to Http404 exceptions in debug mode is essential. Specifically, the 'response_for_exception' method in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' and the 'technical_404_response' function in 'django/views/debug.py' are directly related to the expected behavior described in the issue. Therefore, these spans should be identified as relevant to better understand and potentially modify the behavior of Http404 responses in debug mode.",
