This could be due to how the exception is being handled in the URL resolving process. To address this, we need to focus on the `to_python` method in the converters, the exception handling in `exception.py`, and the technical response generation in `views/debug.py`. We should also consider the resolution process in `urls/resolvers.py` to ensure proper handling of Http404 exceptions.",

The issue specifically highlights that a custom error message should be displayed instead of the default 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.'. The relevant parts of the codebase are those that handle exceptions, specifically Http404, and those that control the behavior of path converters. The search results include several key files: `django/urls/converters.py`, `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, `django/views/debug.py`, and `django/urls/resolvers.py`. These files contain methods like `to_python` in various converters, the `response_for_exception` function which handles Http404 exceptions, and the `technical_404_response` function which generates the 404 response in debug mode. All of these are directly relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file contains the `URLResolver` class which is involved in resolving URLs and handling path conversions, which could be indirectly related to the issue depending on how the converters are used. Overall, these files and methods provide a comprehensive look at how exceptions like Http404 are handled in Django and how path converters contribute to this process. This information is sufficient to understand and potentially address the reported issue.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
