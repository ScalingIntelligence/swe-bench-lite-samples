            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is related to handling Http404 exceptions when DEBUG is True in Django's path converter methods. The issue suggests that raising Http404 should result in a technical response with detailed error messages when debugging is enabled, rather than a generic server error message. This behavior is essential for effective debugging and should be integrated across relevant parts of the Django framework, especially in URL resolving and exception handling.\n\nFrom the provided search results, several key areas are identified as highly relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **django/urls/converters.py** - This file contains the base implementations for URL path converters like IntConverter, StringConverter, and UUIDConverter. These converters include a method `to_python` which is directly related to parsing the URL path component. If an invalid path component is encountered that should raise an Http404, it would be processed here. Relevant spans include: 'IntConverter.to_python', 'StringConverter.to_python', 'UUIDConverter.to_python'.\n\n2. **django/core/handlers/exception.py** - This file handles the conversion of exceptions to HTTP responses, which is crucial for determining how Http404 exceptions are managed and displayed. The `response_for_exception` function specifically checks if an exception is an instance of Http404 and handles it differently based on the DEBUG setting. Relevant spans include: 'response_for_exception', 'get_exception_response', 'handle_uncaught_exception'.\n\n3. **django/views/debug.py** - This file contains the implementation for technical responses which are used when DEBUG is True. Functions like `technical_404_response` and `technical_500_response` are responsible for providing detailed error messages during debugging. Relevant spans include: 'technical_404_response', 'technical_500_response'.\n\n4. **django/shortcuts.py** - This file includes shortcut functions such as `get_object_or_404` which raises an Http404 exception if the requested object does not exist. This function is frequently used in views and is relevant to the context of managing Http404 exceptions. Relevant spans include: 'get_object_or_404'.\n\nAnalyzing these spans in context reveals that the Django framework already has mechanisms in place to handle Http404 exceptions with varying responses based on the DEBUG setting. However, the issue suggests that the current implementation might not be adequately addressing the need for detailed technical responses in all relevant scenarios, particularly in path converters and during URL resolving. Further enhancements might be necessary to ensure consistent behavior across all relevant parts of the framework.",
