The issue suggests that raising Http404 should be a valid way to indicate a path mismatch and provide a detailed response in DEBUG mode. The provided search results show relevant code spans regarding URL resolution, converters, and exception handling in Django. Notably, the IntConverter, StringConverter, and UUIDConverter classes contain the to_python methods where the issue might occur if Http404 is raised. The URLResolver and URLPattern classes handle URL resolution and exception handling, including the handling of Resolver404, which is directly related to the issue. Furthermore, the response_for_exception function in exception.py is crucial as it determines the response type for exceptions, including Http404, and has specific handling based on the DEBUG setting. Also, the technical_404_response function in debug.py is relevant as it defines the behavior for handling 404 errors in DEBUG mode. Given these references, the search results are comprehensive and relevant to the reported issue. The identified code spans cover key areas of interest: URL resolution, error handling for Http404, and the specialized response generation in DEBUG mode.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
