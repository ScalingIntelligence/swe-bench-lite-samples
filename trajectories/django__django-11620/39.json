The issue suggests that raising Http404 should be a valid way to tell the resolver that the current parameter value does not match anything, and it should stop processing and let the handler return the 404 page with a helpful error message when DEBUG is True. I will analyze the provided code to identify relevant sections that handle Http404 and the debug response. From the search results, the Resolver404 class and its handling in the URLResolver class are likely relevant. Additionally, the 'technical_404_response' function in django/views/debug.py seems to be responsible for generating the 404 response in debug mode.
