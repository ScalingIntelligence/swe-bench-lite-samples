Please contact the administrator.'. The search results provide insights into how the Django framework handles exceptions and how Http404 exceptions are specifically managed. Notably, in `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, the function `response_for_exception` checks if the exception is an instance of Http404 and whether DEBUG mode is enabled. If both conditions are met, it calls `debug.technical_404_response(request, exc)`, which suggests this is the part of the code responsible for generating the technical response in DEBUG mode for Http404 errors. This part of the code aligns well with the issue report, indicating that the current implementation indeed aims to provide a detailed error response when DEBUG is True. This offers a confirmation that the current handling of Http404 in DEBUG mode is intentionally designed to provide more information, but there might be a need to ensure this detail is consistently applied or enhanced. Additionally, the code spans in `django/urls/converters.py` show different converters and their to_python methods, which could be relevant if there's a need to adjust how exceptions are handled within these converters specifically. The identified spans directly relate to the reported issue, suggesting they are relevant for further investigation or modification to meet the reported requirement.",
