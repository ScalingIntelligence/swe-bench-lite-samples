            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the handling of Http404 exceptions in the context of path converters when DEBUG is True. The current behavior results in a generic server error message instead of a detailed technical response. The search results reveal several relevant sections of code, particularly in the `django/core/handlers/exception.py` and `django/urls/converters.py` files. In `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, the `response_for_exception` function checks if the exception is an instance of Http404 and if DEBUG is True, in which case it calls `debug.technical_404_response`. This suggests that the handling of Http404 exceptions is centralized here and depends on the DEBUG setting. The `technical_404_response` function in `django/views/debug.py` is responsible for generating the detailed 404 response when DEBUG is True. The path converters themselves, defined in `django/urls/converters.py`, do not currently raise Http404 exceptions in their `to_python` methods, but these methods could be a point of intervention for custom logic related to raising Http404. Given these findings, the relevant code spans are those that deal with exception handling for Http404 and the technical response generation when DEBUG is True.",
