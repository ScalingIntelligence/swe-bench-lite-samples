The issue mentions that raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method does not result in a technical response when DEBUG is True, which suggests that the relevant code spans should be in modules handling URL resolution and exception responses. The search results include code spans from 'django/urls/resolvers.py' that deal with URL resolution, specifically in the 'URLPattern' and 'URLResolver' classes, where the 'resolve' method is defined. This is likely where the Http404 exception is processed or propagated during URL resolution. Additionally, the 'convert_exception_to_response' function in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' handles the conversion of exceptions to responses, including Http404 exceptions when DEBUG is True. This is evidenced by the 'response_for_exception' function which checks for the Http404 exception and calls 'debug.technical_404_response' when DEBUG is True. These code spans are relevant to the issue as they directly affect the handling of Http404 exceptions in the context of URL resolution and DEBUG mode.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
