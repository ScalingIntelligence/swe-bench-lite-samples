Specifically, it mentions that when DEBUG is True, raising Http404 should result in a more informative technical response instead of the default 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.' This indicates that the relevant code spans should involve URL resolution, exception handling, and debug mode response generation.\n\nLooking at the provided code spans, several are highly relevant:\n\n1. In `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, the `response_for_exception` function handles different types of exceptions, including Http404. This function checks if DEBUG mode is enabled and responds accordingly using `debug.technical_404_response` if Http404 is raised.\n\n2. In `django/urls/resolvers.py`, the `URLResolver.resolve` method is central to URL resolution and involves exception handling (including `Resolver404`), which is relevant to the issue. This method iterates through URL patterns to find a match and handles exceptions similarly to how Http404 might be raised and handled within the system.\n\n3. The `technical_404_response` function in `django/views/debug.py` is directly responsible for generating a technical response when Http404 is raised and DEBUG mode is on. It collects necessary information to produce a detailed error response, making it very relevant to the reported issue.\n\nThese code spans collectively indicate that they relate to the core functionalities needed to address the reported issue. They handle exception types like Http404 in the context of URL resolution and debug modes, which directly align with the problem described.",

The current implementation of `response_for_exception` handles Http404 and generates a technical response based on settings.DEBUG. However, it seems the issue might arise from how Http404 is being handled in the context of URL resolution, especially in path converters. To resolve this, we need to ensure that any Http404 raised during URL resolution, specifically in path converters, triggers a technical response when settings.DEBUG is True. This involves modifying `response_for_exception` to account for the context in which Http404 might be raised during the URL resolution process.",
