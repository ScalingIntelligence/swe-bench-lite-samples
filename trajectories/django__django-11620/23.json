The expected behavior is to receive a technical response detailing the error, but instead, a generic error message is received. This problem could be related to the handling of Http404 exceptions in the URL resolving process or the way debug responses are generated. To address this, a focused search in the Django framework's codebase is needed to find the exact locations where Http404 exceptions are processed and debug responses are generated. This will enable us to understand why a technical response is not being produced and how to modify the behavior to match expectations.",

The task involves identifying the relevant code spans where Http404 handling is managed, particularly in the DEBUG mode.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, several key areas are relevant:\n1. The `IntConverter.to_python`, `StringConverter.to_python`, and `UUIDConverter.to_python` methods in `django/urls/converters.py` where the conversion logic resides, although they currently don't handle exceptions directly.\n2. The `response_for_exception` function in `django/core/handlers/exception.py` which specifically checks if the exception is an instance of Http404 and handles it differently based on the DEBUG setting.\n3. The `technical_404_response` function in `django/views/debug.py` which is responsible for rendering a detailed 404 response when DEBUG is True.\n\nThese sections are crucial as they deal directly with how Http404 exceptions are managed and responded to, especially in relation to the DEBUG mode and providing useful error messages.
