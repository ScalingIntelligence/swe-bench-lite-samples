This might involve understanding how exceptions are handled in Django's URL resolving mechanisms, specifically in the context of path converters. There's a need to explore the interaction between path converters, exception handling, and the generation of technical responses. Focused searches on 'to_python' in path converters, along with 'Http404' and 'DEBUG', could help pinpoint the relevant code. Additional investigation into how 'get_object_or_404' might be integrated within these contexts is also relevant.",

The user experiences a non-technical response and wishes for a more informative error message. The search results indeed provide valuable context relevant to this issue. Key files and methods identified include `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, which handles exceptions including Http404, and `django/urls/resolvers.py`, which contains the `URLResolver` class that plays a crucial role in URL resolution. Additionally, `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/forms/fields.py` contain `to_python` methods linked to model and form fields, which might be adapted to raise Http404 based on the user's proposal. The handling of Http404 exceptions in `response_for_exception` inside `django/core/handlers/exception.py` seems particularly relevant to address the issue's core requirement for better error messages when DEBUG mode is active. This method can be further adjusted to provide detailed output when Http404 is raised during development, enhancing the user's ability to debug effectively. Moreover, understanding the flow from `resolve` in `URLResolver` to the handling of exceptions will help in making informed decisions about where to implement changes or augment the debugging information.",

Additionally, the 'get_object_or_404' function in 'django/shortcuts.py' raises Http404 when an object is not found, which could be relevant if integrating with path converters that might use this shortcut function.

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
