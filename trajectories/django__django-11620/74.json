The provided code spans indicate that the current implementation within the Django framework handles exceptions, including Http404, and decides the response based on the DEBUG setting. Specifically, when DEBUG is True, a detailed response is generated (as seen in 'technical_404_response'). The issue suggests that even when DEBUG is True, the current implementation might not provide a detailed response for Http404 from the path converter's to_python method, which aligns with the key sections found in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' and 'django/views/debug.py'. Additionally, the resolvers and URL patterns in 'django/urls/resolvers.py' play a crucial role in how URLs and their parameters are processed, which could be relevant for understanding the context of Http404 errors. The presence of the 'Resolver404' exception handling in the 'resolve' method of 'URLResolver' and its integration in 'response_for_exception' further supports the need to investigate the behavior of Http404 raised specifically within path converters. Therefore, the relevance of these spans to the reported issue is high, and they should be examined in depth to either confirm or address the behavior described.",

Instead, the handling of Http404 is centralized in the exception handling framework, which includes the response_for_exception function within the django/core/handlers/exception.py file. This function checks if the exception is an instance of Http404 and then decides whether to render a technical_404_response based on the DEBUG setting. Given the current structure, it seems that any modifications to provide more informative responses in DEBUG mode should focus on enhancing the technical_404_response function to include details from the path converters context, such as the specific path converter and input value that led to the Http404 exception.",
