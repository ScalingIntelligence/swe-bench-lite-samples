The key spans of code to focus on include the technical 404 response handling in 'django/views/debug.py' which creates a detailed response when DEBUG is True. Additionally, 'django/urls/resolvers.py' contains the URLResolver class that manages URL resolution and raises a Resolver404 exception when a URL pattern does not match. The URLResolver's 'resolve' method is especially relevant, as this is where URL patterns are checked against the given path. Integrating the functionality suggested by the reporter requires a deeper understanding of how these components work together and how they handle exceptions. Furthermore, since the issue suggests a path converter that uses 'get_object_or_404', it's important to consider how such a feature could be implemented, potentially requiring modifications to error handling or connections to view functions that use 'get_object_or_404' and are aware of the DEBUG setting. The provided code sections primarily cover error handling and URL resolution but do not directly include an enhancement like the one suggested. While they are relevant, they do not fully address the specific feature of integrating an enhanced error message on Http404 exceptions while DEBUG is True directly within a path converter's logic.",

  "initial_message": "When DEBUG is True, raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method does not result in a technical response\nDescription\n\t\nThis is the response I get (plain text): \nA server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
