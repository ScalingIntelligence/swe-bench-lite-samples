The expected behavior is to get a technical response detailing the error, but instead, a generic server error message is received. This suggests that possibly the error handling mechanism in Django might not be adequately processing Http404 exceptions in path converters specifically under debug mode. To address this, one would need to investigate the Django source code, particularly focusing on the handling of Http404 exceptions within the context of path converters and the debug mode response mechanism. Specifically, we should look into the `django.urls.converters` module where converters like `StringConverter` and `UUIDConverter` are defined, as well as into `django.core.handlers.exception` and `django.views.debug` to understand how exceptions like Http404 are processed and how debug responses are generated. Furthermore, understanding how the URL resolver operates in `django.urls.resolvers` under the context of raised Http404 exceptions could also be crucial.",

When DEBUG is True, the Django framework uses the `technical_404_response` function from `django.views.debug` to provide a detailed HTML response that includes additional information about the exception. When DEBUG is False, the framework uses the `get_exception_response` function from `django.core.handlers.exception` to handle the exception, typically resulting in a more generic error page or a custom 404 page defined in the URL configuration.\n\nThe code snippets indicate that the `StringConverter` and `UUIDConverter` classes in `django.urls.converters` handle conversion of path components to Python objects through their `to_python` methods. These converters do not directly raise Http404 exceptions; instead, they typically return the converted value or raise a different type of exception if the conversion fails.\n\nTo fully understand the interaction between path converters and the URL resolution process, particularly in relation to Http404 exceptions, we need to explore how these converters are used within the URL resolver (`URLResolver` class in `django.urls.resolvers`). The `URLResolver` is responsible for matching URLs to views and handling the dispatch process, which includes processing any exceptions that occur during URL resolution.

The new search results focus on `django/urls/resolvers.py`, which is relevant for understanding URL resolution and how `Http404` might be handled during resolution. Specifically, the `URLResolver` class and its methods, such as `resolve` and `resolve_error_handler`, are central to the issue.
