The expected behavior is to receive a technical response detailing the error, but instead, a generic server error message is received. This impacts the ability to debug effectively. The relevant code likely resides in the URL resolving and exception handling parts of the Django framework. Specific files like django/urls/resolvers.py, django/core/handlers/exception.py, and django/views/debug.py could contain the necessary code to understand and resolve this issue. Additionally, the path converters themselves, located in django/urls/converters.py, should be examined.",

            "scratch_pad": "Upon analyzing the reported issue and the provided search results, it is evident that the issue revolves around the handling of Http404 exceptions when DEBUG is set to True. The search results include several relevant files and sections of code that deal with URL resolution and exception handling in Django.\n\n1. The `django/urls/resolvers.py` file contains the core logic for URL resolution and includes the `URLResolver` class which is responsible for resolving URLs and handling exceptions like `Resolver404`. This class is particularly relevant as it is where the URL resolution process is managed, and where we might expect to see the handling of `Http404` exceptions.\n\n2. The `django/core/handlers/exception.py` file is crucial as it contains the `convert_exception_to_response` function which is responsible for converting exceptions into HTTP responses. The `response_for_exception` function within this file handles the specific case of `Http404` exceptions and checks the `settings.DEBUG` value to determine the appropriate response.\n\n3. The `django/views/debug.py` file contains functions for generating technical responses in debug mode, such as `technical_404_response` which is called when an `Http404` exception occurs and `settings.DEBUG` is True.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the identified code spans are likely to be those that deal directly with the handling of `Http404` exceptions and the management of debug responses. These spans are used to pinpoint the locations in the codebase where adjustments or enhancements might be necessary to align with the desired behavior described in the issue.\n\nThe identified spans provide a clear path to understanding and potentially modifying the current behavior to better suit the requirements outlined in the issue, without needing to continue searching further.",
