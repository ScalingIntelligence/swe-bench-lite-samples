The search results suggest that the relevant code spans are likely to be found in files related to URL resolving, exception handling, and debug response generation. Specifically, the sections 'convert_exception_to_response', 'response_for_exception', and 'technical_404_response' in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' and 'django/views/debug.py' appear to handle exception responses and debug responses. Additionally, the 'to_python' methods in 'django/urls/converters.py' could be relevant for understanding how converters handle path parsing, although they currently do not directly handle exceptions.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, focusing on the behavior of Http404 within the context of DEBUG mode, and the expectation of more detailed debug responses, the code spans in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' and 'django/views/debug.py' should be considered as highly relevant. The 'URLResolver' and 'ResolverMatch' in 'django/urls/resolvers.py' also provide context for URL resolution mechanisms, which is indirectly related to the issue.
