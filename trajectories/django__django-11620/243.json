Additionally, the 'django/views/debug.py' file contains the specific response generation for a technical 404 response when DEBUG is True, fitting directly into the issue description. The code spans within these files that are relevant to this issue include the methods and classes dealing with URL resolution (like 'URLResolver' and its methods 'resolve' and 'reverse'), the handling of exceptions (specifically 'convert_exception_to_response' and 'response_for_exception'), and the generation of technical error responses ('technical_404_response').

The analysis of the provided file context reveals that when DEBUG is True, Http404 exceptions are handled by invoking the `technical_404_response` method from `django/views/debug.py`. This method constructs a technical 404 response with detailed debugging information. The `resolve` methods in both `URLPattern` and `URLResolver` classes are involved in the URL resolving process, which could lead to a `Resolver404` exception if a path does not match. The `response_for_exception` method in `django/core/handlers/exception.py` is responsible for generating an appropriate response for exceptions, including Http404. Given the presence of these key components in the file contexts, it appears that the relevant code for handling Http404 exceptions during debugging is provided. The code also indicates that the technical_404_response function is designed to provide detailed debugging information when DEBUG is True, resolving the issue as described.",
