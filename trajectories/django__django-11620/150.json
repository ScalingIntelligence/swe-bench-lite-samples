To address this, it's necessary to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle Http404 exceptions and their behavior in debug mode. The provided search results include several key files and spans that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. In `django/urls/resolvers.py`, the `URLResolver.resolve` method deals with URL resolution and handles `Resolver404` exceptions. This is crucial as it shows how the URL resolver tries to match paths and how it propagates `Resolver404` exceptions up the chain.\n\n2. In `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, the `convert_exception_to_response` and `response_for_exception` functions are central to exception handling in Django. Specifically, `response_for_exception` checks if the exception is an instance of `Http404` and behaves differently based on the `DEBUG` setting. This is directly related to the issue as it determines the response format in debug mode.\n\n3. In `django/views/debug.py`, the `technical_404_response` function is responsible for generating a technical response when `DEBUG` is True. This function is crucial as it constructs the response that should be shown instead of the default, non-technical response.\n\nGiven these findings, it's clear that modifying the behavior of `Http404` exceptions when `DEBUG` is True would involve changes to these specific parts of the code.\n\nFrom the search results, the identified spans provide a complete understanding of how Http404 exceptions are handled and how they should technically respond in debug mode. The identified spans are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying this behavior.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
