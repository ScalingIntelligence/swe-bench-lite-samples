Please contact the administrator.'.\n\nThe analysis of the search results reveals several key parts of the Django framework that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **django/urls/resolvers.py**: This file contains the `URLResolver` class and its methods, which are central to URL resolution in Django. The `_get_cached_resolver` and `get_ns_resolver` functions are responsible for caching and resolving URLs, respectively. These are key to understanding how URL resolution works in Django.\n\n2. **django/urls/converters.py**: This file contains the converter classes (`IntConverter`, `StringConverter`, `UUIDConverter`), which are used to convert path parameters into Python objects. The `to_python` method in these classes is where conversions happen, and it's likely where any custom handling for Http404 should be added.\n\n3. **django/views/debug.py**: This file contains the `technical_404_response` function, which is used to generate detailed 404 responses when DEBUG is True. This function is directly related to the user's request for a more informative error message when a Http404 is raised.\n\n4. **django/core/handlers/exception.py**: This file contains the `response_for_exception` function, which handles exceptions generally, and specifically deals with Http404 exceptions. It checks if DEBUG is True and calls `technical_404_response` if it is.\n\nThese parts of the Django codebase are directly relevant to the issue at hand. The `URLResolver` and converter classes are where the actual URL resolution and path conversion happen, and the debug and exception handling files are where responses are generated based on the context (e.g., DEBUG mode).\n\nGiven the reported issue, the relevant code spans are those that deal with URL resolution, path conversion, and exception handling in DEBUG mode. These spans include parts of the `URLResolver` class, the `to_python` methods in the converter classes, and the `technical_404_response` function. Identifying these spans is crucial for understanding where and how to implement changes to address the issue.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
