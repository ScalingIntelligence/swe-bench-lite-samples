Please contact the administrator.' message. The search results provide insights into how URL resolution and exception handling are managed in Django. Specifically, the URLResolver and URLPattern classes in django/urls/resolvers.py manage URL resolution, including how patterns are matched and exceptions like Resolver404 are handled. In django/core/handlers/exception.py, the handling of exceptions such as Http404 is detailed, showing how responses are generated based on exception types and the DEBUG setting. Finally, django/views/debug.py contains the technical_404_response function, which is responsible for generating a detailed 404 response when DEBUG is True. This function is crucial for addressing the issue as it directly relates to how 404 errors are presented in debug mode. By analyzing these code spans, it's clear that enhancing the exception handling for Http404 to provide more detailed responses in debug mode involves modifications primarily in the technical_404_response function in django/views/debug.py and possibly adjustments in how exceptions are escalated in the URL resolution process in django/urls/resolvers.py.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
