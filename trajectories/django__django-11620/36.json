The expected behavior is to receive a technical response with a helpful error message, but instead, the response is a generic server error message. The search results provide several code spans that are relevant to resolving this issue.\n\n1. **django/urls/resolvers.py**:\n   - **RoutePattern.match**: This method attempts to match a URL path and includes the handling of converting path values using converters. It specifically catches a ValueError, which aligns with the suggestion to use ValueError for such cases. This method could be modified to also handle Http404 exceptions as suggested.\n   - **URLResolver.resolve**: This method resolves a URL path through a series of patterns. It handles Resolver404 exceptions, which suggests that this area of the code is central to understanding URL resolution failures.\n\n2. **django/views/debug.py**:\n   - **technical_404_response**: This function generates a technical 404 response. The existing function is called when DEBUG is True, but it appears to miss handling Http404 directly in the path converter context. This function should be reviewed and possibly modified to ensure it provides a technical response for Http404 raised in converters.\n\n3. **django/core/handlers/exception.py**:\n   - **response_for_exception**: This function handles exceptions during request processing and is where Http404 exceptions are currently being processed for technical responses when DEBUG is True. This area of code should ensure that Http404 raised in path converters results in the correct technical response.\n\nBy focusing on these specific code spans, we can address the issue by ensuring that Http404 exceptions raised within path converters result in a technical response when DEBUG is True. The integration of these changes should consider the flow of URL resolution and exception handling to maintain coherence in Django's error response mechanisms.",
