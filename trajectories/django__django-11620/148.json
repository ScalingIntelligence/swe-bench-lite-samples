The user expects a more informative error response than the generic 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator'. The search results should therefore focus on the handling of Http404 exceptions in the context of path converters and the debug mode.\n\nAnalysis of the search results shows that the relevant code spans are primarily located in two files: 'django/urls/converters.py' and 'django/core/handlers/exception.py'. In 'django/urls/converters.py', there are several path converter classes with a to_python method, none of which currently handle the Http404 exception. This method would need to be modified to align with the issue's requirements.\n\nIn 'django/core/handlers/exception.py', the 'response_for_exception' function specifically addresses the handling of Http404 exceptions and checks the DEBUG setting to determine the response type. This is directly related to the issue as it concerns the behavior of Http404 in debug mode.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified relevant code spans are:\n- In 'django/urls/converters.py', the 'IntConverter.to_python', 'StringConverter.to_python', and 'UUIDConverter.to_python' methods.\n- In 'django/core/handlers/exception.py', the 'response_for_exception' function.\n\nThese selections are made based on their direct relation to the handling of path converters and Http404 exceptions in the context of the DEBUG setting, which are key elements of the reported issue.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
