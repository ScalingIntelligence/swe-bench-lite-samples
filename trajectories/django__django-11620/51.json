Specifically, when DEBUG is True, raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method does not yield a technical response as expected. Instead, it results in a generic server error message. This suggests a need to investigate how exceptions are handled in the context of URL resolving and path conversion. The relevant files identified from the context involve exception handling, URL resolution, and path converters. The focus should be on the to_python method of path converters, the resolve method of URLResolver, and any related sections handling Http404 exceptions.",

From the search results, I will look for:\n\n1. Code related to the StringConverter and its to_python method since it might be relevant to understand how conversions are handled.\n2. Code related to the URLResolver and its resolve method, as this is where URL patterns are matched and exceptions might be raised or handled.\n3. Code related to the handling of Http404 exceptions, especially in the context of DEBUG mode in files like `django/core/handlers/exception.py` and `django/views/debug.py`.\n4.

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
