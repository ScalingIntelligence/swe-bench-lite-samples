The expected outcome is a technical response, but instead, a generic server error message is received. To address this, I will focus on identifying the relevant code spans that handle the Http404 exception and the DEBUG mode response. I will also look for any related methods or classes that might influence this behavior.\n\nFirst, I reviewed the search results in 'django/urls/converters.py', where I found multiple converters like IntConverter, StringConverter, and UUIDConverter, and their respective to_python methods. While these methods are essential for converting path values, they do not directly handle exceptions nor are they responsible for generating HTTP responses.\n\nNext, I examined 'django/urls/resolvers.py'. Here, I identified the URLPattern and URLResolver classes. The URLResolver.resolve method includes logic for handling Resolver404 exceptions, indicating that it is involved in the URL resolution process and could be relevant when considering how path converters interact with the URL resolver and how exceptions are handled during this process. The method already raises Resolver404, which suggests it is capable of signaling the URL resolver to stop processing if no match is found, and thus it might be the right place to also handle Http404 raised by converters, considering the scenario where a path parameter does not match any object.\n\nLastly, in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py', I found the convert_exception_to_response, response_for_exception, get_exception_response, and handle_uncaught_exception functions, all of which play a role in converting exceptions into HTTP responses. The response_for_exception function specifically checks if the exception is an instance of Http404 and constructs a response based on the DEBUG setting. This code is directly related to the behavior that is the subject of the reported issue, because it defines what happens to an Http404 exception when it occurs during request processing, including whether to display a detailed technical response or a generic error page.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will identify the relevant code spans from 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' as they contain the logic for handling URL resolution exceptions and converting exceptions to HTTP responses, respectively.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
