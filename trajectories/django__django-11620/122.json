The expected behavior is to get a detailed technical response, but instead, a generic 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.' message is received. This suggests an investigation into how Http404 exceptions are handled in DEBUG mode.\n\nThe search results provide insights into several key areas:\n1. **django/urls/converters.py**: This file contains definitions for path converters like StringConverter and UUIDConverter, including their to_python methods. These methods are responsible for converting the URL captured string to the appropriate Python type. Relevant spans are 'StringConverter.to_python' and 'UUIDConverter.to_python'.\n\n2. **django/urls/resolvers.py**: This file deals with URL resolution, including the URLResolver class which is central to how Django resolves URLs. The 'URLResolver.resolve' method is particularly relevant as it handles the resolution process and exception handling during URL resolution. The relevant span is 'URLResolver.resolve'.\n\n3. **django/views/debug.py**: Contains debug-related functionality, including the technical_404_response function which generates detailed 404 error responses in DEBUG mode. This function is directly related to the expected behavior of displaying detailed error messages for Http404 exceptions when DEBUG is True. The relevant span is 'technical_404_response'.\n\n4. **django/core/handlers/exception.py**: This file handles exception to response conversion, including the response_for_exception function which decides what type of response to send based on the exception type. This function handles Http404 exceptions and determines if a technical 404 response should be shown based on the DEBUG setting. The relevant span is 'response_for_exception'.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of Http404 handling in DEBUG mode. These spans cover the path conversion, URL resolution, and exception handling processes central to the issue.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
