The issue specifies that raising Http404 should result in a technical response instead of a generic error message. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the Http404 exception and determine if they are appropriately responding with a technical response in DEBUG mode.\n\nIn the provided search results, I found several relevant spans across multiple files:\n\n1. In `django/views/debug.py`, the `technical_404_response` span is crucial as it defines what happens when a technical 404 response is needed. This function is likely to be called when DEBUG is True and an Http404 is raised.\n\n2. In `django/core/handlers/exception.py`, the `response_for_exception` span is important. This function checks if the exception is an Http404 and then decides whether to call `technical_404_response` based on the DEBUG setting. This confirms that the DEBUG setting controls whether a technical response is shown.\n\n3. In `django/urls/resolvers.py`, the `URLResolver.resolve` span is relevant as it deals with resolving URLs and can raise Resolver404, which is related to the Http404 exception handling.\n\nThese spans collectively show the flow of handling an Http404 exception, from determining the response type based on the DEBUG setting to actually generating the technical response. Thus, these are the key code spans relevant to the reported issue.",

These files are directly relevant to the issue as they handle exception responses and URL resolution. The function `technical_404_response` in `django/views/debug.py` is particularly relevant as it customizes the 404 response in debug mode. Additionally, the `response_for_exception` function in `django/core/handlers/exception.py` deals with converting exceptions to HTTP responses, including handling Http404.
