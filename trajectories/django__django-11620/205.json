The desired outcome is to have a more descriptive error message when DEBUG is True, indicating that the current parameter value does not match anything, and to potentially use get_object_or_404 within the path converter. To address this, we should focus our search on the interactions between path converters, URL resolvers, and exception handling in Django, particularly in files related to exception handling, URL resolution, and path converters. The provided file context indicates that no files have been found yet, so we should initiate the search based on the identified possible points of interest.",

The issue suggests that raising Http404 should stop URL resolution and return a 404 page with a helpful error message in DEBUG mode. The search results provide several relevant code spans, particularly in the 'django/urls/resolvers.py' and 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' files, which handle URL resolution and exception conversion, respectively. Key spans include those handling URLResolver, Resolver404, and the convert_exception_to_response function. These are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior around raising Http404 and resolving errors. It appears that further analysis around the behavior of Http404 in DEBUG mode should focus on modifying the response_for_exception function in 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' to provide detailed error messages when DEBUG is True. Additionally, understanding how the RoutePattern and URLResolver classes deal with path conversion and resolution might also be important for implementing changes that align with the reported issue.",

Specifically, we're looking for code spans that deal with the resolution process and the handling of such exceptions. From the provided file context and search results, we can observe key areas of interest: 1) The `RoutePattern.match` method in `django/urls/resolvers.py` where the to_python method is called and where a ValueError is expected. 2) The `response_for_exception` function in `django/core/handlers/exception.py` that handles different exceptions and decides if a technical response should be returned based on the DEBUG setting. 3) The `get_object_or_404` function in `django/shortcuts.py`, though not directly related to the URL resolution process, demonstrates the application of raising Http404 for object retrieval. From the search results, specific code spans such as `RoutePattern.match`, `response_for_exception`, and `get_object_or_404` are identified as potentially relevant to investigate further for understanding and solving the issue. Additionally, the init and resolve methods of URLResolver are also crucial as they tie into the URL resolution process and could provide more context on how exceptions like Http404 are managed during this process.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
