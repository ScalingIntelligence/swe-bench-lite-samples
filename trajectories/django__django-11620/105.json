The code spans from django/urls/resolvers.py show the URLPattern and URLResolver classes involved in URL resolution. The URLResolver.resolve method handles exceptions like Resolver404 which are relevant. The django/core/handlers/exception.py file contains the convert_exception_to_response and response_for_exception functions, which specifically handle Http404 exceptions and differentiate responses based on the DEBUG setting. The response_for_exception function is crucial as it decides whether to show a technical error response or a generic one.

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
