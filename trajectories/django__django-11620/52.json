The key points are: 1) Http404 raised in a path converter should result in a 404 response with a helpful error message when DEBUG is True. 2) Currently, raising Http404 results in a generic server error message. The relevant files and code spans from the provided context and search results are: 1) django/urls/resolvers.py - specifically the URLResolver.resolve method where the actual resolution of URLs happens and where an Http404 could be raised. 2) django/views/debug.py - particularly the technical_404_response function, which is responsible for generating the detailed 404 response when DEBUG is True. 3) django/conf/urls/__init__.py - where the default handlers for 404 errors are defined, which might need to be adjusted or understood better in the context of the issue. 4) The to_python methods in django/urls/converters.py, as these are the methods where Http404 could potentially be raised directly, although the current issue seems more about the handling of this exception post-raising. Based on the reported issue and the existing context, further analysis is necessary to understand where exactly the Http404 exception handling fails to translate into a detailed technical response under DEBUG mode.",

The presence of these sections indicates that the relevant code for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of `Http404` exceptions in DEBUG mode is provided.

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
