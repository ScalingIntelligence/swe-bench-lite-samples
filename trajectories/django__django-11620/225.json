The expected behavior is to get a technical response detailing the error, but instead, a generic server error message is received. Given the context provided, it's crucial to investigate how Django handles Http404 exceptions in both debug and production modes. Focus should be on the URL resolution process and how exceptions are converted to responses. Specifically, the path converters and their to_python methods, along with the exception handling middleware and views, should be examined to determine where and why the technical response is not being generated.",

The user expects a helpful error message in DEBUG mode but receives a generic server error message instead. Given the issue, it's essential to identify code spans related to Http404 handling and the DEBUG mode setting.\n\nFrom the search results, several key areas are identified:\n1. **django/urls/converters.py**: This file contains the `IntConverter`, `StringConverter`, and `UUIDConverter` classes, which include the `to_python` methods. These methods are relevant as they convert URL path components to Python objects, and might be where Http404 exceptions could be raised.\n2. **django/core/handlers/exception.py**: This file contains the `response_for_exception` function, which handles different types of exceptions, including Http404. The function checks the DEBUG setting and renders a technical 404 response if DEBUG is True.\n3. **django/views/debug.py**: This file contains the `technical_404_response` function, which generates detailed 404 error messages when DEBUG is True.\n4. **django/views/defaults.py**: This file includes the `page_not_found` function, which handles 404 errors in non-DEBUG mode.\n\nAll these sections of code are relevant to the issue at hand.
