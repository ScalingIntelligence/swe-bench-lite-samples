            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the handling of Http404 exceptions in Django's path converters, specifically when DEBUG is True. The user expects a more informative response instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns' message. To address this, we need to examine how Django handles URL resolution and how Http404 exceptions are managed in these processes. The search results provide insights into Django's URL resolution mechanism and debug response handling.\n\nFirstly, the `django/urls/converters.py` file contains definitions for various path converters, including `IntConverter`, `StringConverter`, `UUIDConverter`, and `PathConverter`. Notably, none of these converters directly handle Http404 exceptions, which suggests that the issue might lie within the URL resolution process itself rather than in the converters.\n\nNext, the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file offers a detailed look into Django's URL resolution logic. The `URLResolver` class is central to this process, with methods like `resolve`, which attempts to match the requested path to a registered URL pattern. The `Resolver404` exception is raised if no match is found, and this appears to be the point where the handling of Http404 exceptions intertwines with the resolution process. The `resolve` method is particularly relevant as it deals directly with URL patterns and the associated exceptions.\n\nLastly, the `django/views/debug.py` file contains the `technical_404_response` function, which is responsible for generating a detailed 404 response when DEBUG is True. This function captures and enhances the information presented to the developer, making it a critical component for addressing the issue described in the reported issue. The function processes exceptions, gathers debugging information, and renders a technical template that reveals more about the error context.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans for addressing the reported issue would involve the `URLResolver` methods in `django/urls/resolvers.py` and the `technical_404_response` function in `django/views/debug.py`. These parts of the code handle URL resolution and technical debug responses, respectively, making them the focal points for modifications to improve Http404 exception handling during debug mode.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
