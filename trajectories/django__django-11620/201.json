This involves understanding how Http404 exceptions are managed in the Django URL resolver and how the debug response is generated. Here's a detailed breakdown of the search results to identify relevant code:\n\n1. **django/urls/resolvers.py**:\n   - **Span 'RoutePattern.match'**: This contains the logic for matching a path and converting it using the path converters. It catches ValueError to 'try next one', but does not handle Http404.\n   - **Span 'URLResolver.resolve'**: This is where the URL resolution happens. It includes handling of Resolver404 exceptions but does not specifically mention Http404 handling.\n   - **Span 'URLResolver.resolve_error_handler'**: This method resolves error handlers, which might be relevant if an error handler is used when an Http404 is raised.\n2. **django/views/debug.py**:\n   - **Span 'technical_404_response'**: This function generates a technical 404 response when DEBUG is True. This is directly relevant as it specifies how a detailed 404 response is generated in debug mode.\n3. **django/core/handlers/exception.py**:\n   - **Span 'response_for_exception'**: This method handles various exceptions including Http404. It checks if DEBUG is True and if so, calls the technical_404_response to provide a detailed response.\n\nGiven these insights, the key spans related to the issue are those in 'resolvers.py' that deal with URL resolution and path conversion, particularly where Http404 could potentially be raised but is not currently handled for detailed responses in DEBUG mode. Additionally, the 'technical_404_response' function in 'debug.py' is crucial for generating the wanted detailed response when DEBUG is True.\n\nBased on the analysis above, potentially relevant code spans have been identified: the 'RoutePattern.match' in 'resolvers.py' which involves path matching and the 'technical_404_response' function in 'debug.py' which generates detailed error responses.",

The file context contains significant portions of Django's URL resolving mechanism, including the `RoutePattern` and `URLResolver` classes, which are crucial for understanding how paths are matched and the exceptions are processed.\n\nFurther, the `technical_404_response` function in `django/views/debug.py` provides a technical response for Http404 errors specifically when DEBUG mode is active, which aligns with the issue's requirement. The presence of this function indicates that the handling for Http404 errors during debugging is already partially implemented, suggesting that the necessary components for modifying the behavior may be present.\n\nAdditionally, the `convert_exception_to_response` function in `django/core/handlers/exception.py` demonstrates how exceptions like Http404 are converted to responses, with special handling for DEBUG mode. This confirms that the project's handling of Http404 specifically during debugging is integrated into its exception handling workflow.\n\nOverall, while not all details of the exact implementation of raising Http404 in a path converter's `to_python` method and ensuring a technical response are explicitly shown, the provided code suggests that the Django project has architectural components in place to facilitate this functionality. Thus, it seems likely that the relevant code can be found within the provided file context or by following the logical flow established in the codebase.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the file context provided offers a comprehensive look into Django's handling of Http404 errors when DEBUG is True, and relevant areas that would likely be modified or extended to address the issue are identifiable.",
