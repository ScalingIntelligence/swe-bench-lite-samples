This suggests that the focus should be on the handling of Http404 exceptions within the Django framework, particularly in the context of DEBUG mode and URL resolution. The search results include several relevant files and spans of code:\n\n1. **django/urls/converters.py**: Contains the implementation of various converters like IntConverter, StringConverter, and UUIDConverter, including their to_python methods.\n2. **django/urls/resolvers.py**: Contains the URLResolver class which is central to URL resolution. This includes methods like resolve, which handles the resolution of URLs, and _get_cached_resolver, which caches resolvers.\n3. **django/core/handlers/exception.py**: Contains the handling of exceptions during request processing, including specific handling for Http404 when DEBUG is True through the response_for_exception function.\n\nThe focus should be on ensuring that raising Http404 in a converter (e.g., during the to_python method) is correctly handled in DEBUG mode. This might involve modifying the response_for_exception function to provide a more detailed technical response. Additionally, examining the URLResolver's handling of path conversion errors might be necessary to ensure it integrates well with the exception handling mechanism.
