            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the handling of Http404 exceptions when DEBUG is True. Specifically, the user expects a more technical response instead of the default 'A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.' message. To address this, I need to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle Http404 exceptions and the response generation in debug mode.\n\n1. **Django URL Resolvers and Http404 Handling**: The code in `django/urls/resolvers.py` includes the `URLResolver` and `URLPattern` classes, which are central to URL resolution and handling of path matching. The `resolve` method in both classes could be involved in the process of raising Http404 exceptions, which need to be examined.\n\n2. **Debug Responses for Http404**: The file `django/views/debug.py` contains a function `technical_404_response`. This function is responsible for generating technical responses for 404 errors when DEBUG is True. This is directly relevant to the issue as it indicates how the debug response is constructed.\n\n3. **Exception Handling in Django**: The file `django/core/handlers/exception.py` contains the `response_for_exception` function which handles different types of exceptions, including Http404. This function checks if the exception is an instance of Http404 and constructs the appropriate response based on the DEBUG setting. This part of the code is crucial for understanding how the response behavior changes with the DEBUG setting.\n\n4. **Path Converters**: While not directly mentioned in the issue, the file `django/urls/converters.py` contains path converter classes. Although the issue does not directly address path converters, understanding how `to_python` methods in these converters handle input could provide insight into potential areas for enhancement related to exception handling within converters.\n\nBy examining these parts of the code, I can determine if the current implementation aligns with the user's expectation of a more detailed technical response when DEBUG is True and identify any necessary adjustments or improvements.",
