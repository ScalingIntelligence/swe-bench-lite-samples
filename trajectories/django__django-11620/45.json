The problem seems to be that Http404 is not being handled correctly in the path resolving process when DEBUG is active. To address this, we need to look into how Http404 exceptions are handled in relation to path converters and the overall URL resolving process, especially focusing on debug mode response handling.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue is about the behavior of raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method when DEBUG is True. The user expects a more helpful error message instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns'. I analyzed the search results to identify relevant code spans that might affect this behavior. The search results included several Django core files such as `converters.py`, `related.py`, `fields/__init__.py`, and `resolvers.py`. I focused on the `to_python` methods in these files, particularly in `IntConverter`, `StringConverter`, `UUIDConverter`, `ForeignKey`, `IntegerField`, `FileField`, `URLField`, and `DateTimeField`. Additionally, I looked at the `URLResolver` class in `resolvers.py`, which handles URL resolution and error handling. However, the main concern is about the behavior of `Http404` in the context of DEBUG mode, so I need to check if raising `Http404` in the `to_python` methods of these converters triggers the expected behavior. After reviewing the code, it appears that none of the `to_python` methods directly handle the `Http404` exception or its effects in DEBUG mode, suggesting that further investigation is needed to identify where this behavior is defined in the Django codebase.",

The search results provide relevant code spans in multiple files, primarily focusing on the URL resolving and error handling mechanisms in Django. Here's a breakdown of the relevant code:\n\n1. **django/urls/resolvers.py** - This file contains the core URL resolving logic, including the `URLResolver` class, which is responsible for matching paths to views. Key spans include the `resolve`, `_check_custom_error_handlers`, and `resolve_error_handler` methods.\n\n2. **django/urls/base.py** - This file contains utility functions related to URL resolving, like `resolve` and `is_valid_path`, which are used to find view functions for given paths.\n\n3. **django/views/debug.py** - This file handles technical responses for errors in DEBUG mode, including the `technical_404_response` function. This is particularly relevant as it generates technical debugging information when an Http404 error occurs.\n\n4. **django/core/handlers/exception.py** - This file is responsible for converting exceptions into HTTP responses. The `response_for_exception` function is key here, as it checks for Http404 exceptions and decides whether to show a technical response based on the DEBUG setting.\n\nCombining these pieces of code, we can see the flow when an Http404 is raised: it is caught by `response_for_exception`, which in turn calls `technical_404_response` if DEBUG is True. This setup suggests that the system is designed to provide a detailed response in DEBUG mode, but the issue states that this doesn't happen for Http404 raised in certain contexts, indicating a possible bug or missing feature. The identified code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing this behavior.",
