The 'django/views/debug.py' file includes the 'technical_404_response' function, which is likely responsible for generating the technical response for 404 errors when DEBUG is True. The 'django/core/handlers/exception.py' file contains the 'response_for_exception' function, which handles the conversion of exceptions to HTTP responses, including Http404.
