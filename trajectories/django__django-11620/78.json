The issue notes that raising Http404 does not result in a technical response, which is the expected behavior when DEBUG is enabled. \n\n2. The search results provide insight into how Django handles exceptions, particularly Http404, by examining the `convert_exception_to_response` and `response_for_exception` functions in `django/core/handlers/exception.py`. The latter function includes a check for DEBUG mode and specifies that, if enabled, a technical response should be generated for Http404 exceptions by calling `debug.technical_404_response`.\n\n3. Relevant code spans within `django/urls/converters.py` show core converters (`IntConverter`, `StringConverter`, and `UUIDConverter`) and their `to_python` methods, suggesting these are places where the issue could manifest.\n\n4. The `technical_404_response` function in `django/views/debug.py` elaborates on how the technical 404 response is generated. This includes details on how the request path, urlconf, and other context data are incorporated into the response. \n\nGiven the above analysis, it's clear that the reported issue aligns with the functionality of handling Http404 exceptions in DEBUG mode. The identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue and show the potential points of failure or adjustment when the issue is addressed. These spans cover the core logic for handling exceptions, including when DEBUG mode is active, and therefore are key for any modifications or enhancements to the existing functionality.",

Please contact the administrator.\nI understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver \"this path does not match, try next one\" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.\nOne could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver \"this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')\".\nThis would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.\n"
