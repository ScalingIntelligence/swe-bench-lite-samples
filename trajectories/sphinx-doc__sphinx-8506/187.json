The error message suggests that Sphinx is now more restrictive about what constitutes valid option syntax. The relevant code spans that address this issue are found in the 'sphinx/domains/std.py' file, specifically in the 'Cmdoption' class which is responsible for handling the 'option' directive. The 'handle_signature' method in this class is where the malformed option description warning is generated. Additionally, the 'add_target_and_index' and 'make_old_id' methods within the 'Cmdoption' class are relevant as they handle the indexing and ID generation for command options, which might be impacted by the change in syntax handling.

Additionally, checking for modifications or additions in the domain logic related to directives, such as the `std` domain, could provide insight into how directives like 'option::' are now processed.

The error message suggests that Sphinx has a very restrictive idea of what option syntax is and doesn't accept any string, which is problematic because not all programs and OSes have option syntax that matches the limited list the error message indicates.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are identified within the 'Cmdoption' class, specifically in 'handle_signature' and 'add_target_and_index' methods. The 'handle_signature' method is responsible for parsing the option syntax and generating warnings for malformed options. The regular expression 'option_desc_re' in 'handle_signature' is particularly relevant as it defines the pattern for acceptable option syntax, which seems to be the source of the issue.\n\nModifying or adjusting 'option_desc_re' to be more flexible and accept a broader range of option syntax could potentially resolve the issue. Additionally, 'add_target_and_index' method is relevant as it handles the document targets and indexing for options, which is also related to the issue at hand. Since the primary concern is with the way options are parsed and the syntax constraints, the identified code spans directly relate to the issue and should be considered for further investigation or modification.\n\nGiven the context and the search results, the relevant code spans have been identified, and these relate directly to the reported issue regarding the 'option::' syntax acceptance in Sphinx 3.2.
