The error message indicates a problem with the way options are described in the documentation. The relevant parts of the codebase to investigate would be the `Cmdoption` class in `sphinx/domains/std.py` and any related handling of directives or options in Sphinx. Additionally, the `ReSTDirectiveOption` class in `sphinx/domains/rst.py` might also be relevant as it deals with ReST markup and directives. The goal is to understand why the new version of Sphinx is being more restrictive and if there is a way to adjust the code to accept the older syntax or update the documentation to comply with the new standards.",
