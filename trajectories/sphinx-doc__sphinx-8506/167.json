Specifically, the error message indicates that Sphinx expects option descriptions to follow specific patterns like 'opt', '-opt args', '--opt args', '/opt args', or '+opt args'. The provided search results include `sphinx/domains/std.py`, which contains the `Cmdoption` class and its methods `handle_signature`, `add_target_and_index`, and `make_old_id`. The `handle_signature` method uses a regular expression (`option_desc_re`) to validate option descriptions, and it logs a warning if the description doesn't match the expected format. This class and its methods are directly relevant to the issue because they handle the parsing and validation of command-line options, which aligns with the problem reported. Additionally, the `StandardDomain` class in the same file registers the `Cmdoption` class as the handler for the 'option' directive, further confirming the relevance. Based on this analysis, the identified spans in `sphinx/domains/std.py` are relevant to the reported issue.",

Earlier versions of Sphinx were fine with this, but Sphinx 3.2 complains:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning, treated as error:\r\n../../docs/qemu-option-trace.rst.inc:4:Malformed option description '[enable=]PATTERN', should look like \"opt\", \"-opt args\", \"--opt args\", \"/opt args\" or \"+opt args\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSphinx ideally shouldn't change in ways that break the building of documentation that worked in older versions, because this makes it unworkably difficult to have documentation that builds with whatever the Linux distro's sphinx-build is.\r\n\r\nThe error message suggests that Sphinx has a very restrictive idea of what option syntax is; it would be better if it just accepted any string, because not all programs and OSes have option syntax that matches the limited list the error message indicates.\r\n\n"
