The error message suggests that Sphinx now has a very specific and restrictive idea of what constitutes valid option syntax. The relevant code spans should be identified in the context of the Sphinx directives and options handling, particularly focusing on how options are parsed and validated in the `LiteralInclude` and `ReSTDirectiveOption` classes. The `option_spec` definitions and the `handle_signature` method from `ReSTDirectiveOption` are critical for understanding how options are being processed and validated. Additionally, it is important to review the `LiteralInclude.run` method to see how the `option::` syntax is being handled and integrated into the documentation process. Furthermore, it may be necessary to examine other sections of the code, such as `sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py`, to understand the broader context of how Sphinx directives are set up and used. This thorough review will help in identifying the relevant code spans and understanding the root cause of the issue to decide if the search is complete.",
