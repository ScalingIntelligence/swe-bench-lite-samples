The error message indicates that Sphinx 3.2 has a stricter validation for option syntax and is not accepting the syntax used in the QEMU documentation. To address this, the relevant code spans in the provided search results focus on the handling of command line options within Sphinx, specifically in the domains/std.py file. The 'Cmdoption' class contains the methods 'handle_signature' and 'add_target_and_index', which are critical for processing and validating the command line options. Additionally, the 'option_desc_re' regular expression is responsible for matching and parsing these options. Understanding and potentially modifying these parts of the code would be crucial for adapting to the stricter validation in Sphinx 3.2. Furthermore, the 'OptionXRefRole' class in the same file could also be relevant if there are cross-referencing issues arising from the syntax change.",

Earlier versions of Sphinx were fine with this, but Sphinx 3.2 complains:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning, treated as error:\r\n../../docs/qemu-option-trace.rst.inc:4:Malformed option description '[enable=]PATTERN', should look like \"opt\", \"-opt args\", \"--opt args\", \"/opt args\" or \"+opt args\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSphinx ideally shouldn't change in ways that break the building of documentation that worked in older versions, because this makes it unworkably difficult to have documentation that builds with whatever the Linux distro's sphinx-build is.\r\n\r\nThe error message suggests that Sphinx has a very restrictive idea of what option syntax is; it would be better if it just accepted any string, because not all programs and OSes have option syntax that matches the limited list the error message indicates.\r\n\n"
