The objective is to raise an error for non-boolean values to ensure consistency and avoid confusion.

The IsNull class is found in the 'django/db/models/lookups.py' file, specifically in the 'IsNull' and 'IsNull.as_sql' spans. The 'IsNull.as_sql' method is crucial as it determines how the SQL query is constructed based on the rhs value. For now, there is no explicit validation for the rhs value being a boolean. The 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file also contains relevant spans, particularly in the 'Query.build_lookup' method, which builds the lookup for the query. This method also deals with the rhs value and might need adjustments to handle non-boolean values correctly. The 'django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py' file contains the 'get_normalized_value' function, which may also need to consider the type of the value being passed to ensure it is not non-boolean when used with the __isnull lookup. Thus, these three files and their respective spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

This involves identifying the current implementation of the 'isnull' lookup and checking the type of the value being passed to it. After reviewing the file context, the main file of interest is 'django/db/models/lookups.py', specifically the 'IsNull' class which handles the 'isnull' lookup. The relevant code spans in this file are the 'IsNull' class itself, its '__init__' method, and the 'as_sql' method where the actual SQL is generated based on the lookup. The 'build_lookup' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' is also relevant as it is responsible for constructing the lookups and could potentially check the type of the lookup value. For ensuring the type check, we need to look for a mechanism to enforce that the 'rhs' (right-hand side) of the 'isnull' lookup is a boolean. Based on the provided search results, the 'build_lookup' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' could include a type check for the 'rhs' value before constructing the lookup, and the 'as_sql' method of the 'IsNull' class in 'django/db/models/lookups.py' should ensure that the SQL generated correctly reflects the boolean nature of the lookup.

IMO we should raise an error for non-boolean values to avoid confusion and for consistency.\n"
