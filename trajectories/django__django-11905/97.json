This requires identifying the code spans that handle the `__isnull` lookup and ensuring that non-boolean values trigger an error. From the search results, it is evident that the `__isnull` lookup is defined and handled in multiple places within the Django ORM. Specifically, the `IsNull` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` is crucial as it directly handles the `isnull` lookup. Also, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is relevant as it builds filters and handles queries, including those using `__isnull`. Additionally, the `RelatedIsNull` class in `django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py` is pertinent as it extends the `IsNull` lookup to related fields. These classes and methods must be inspected to ensure they raise an error when `__isnull` is used with non-boolean values. Furthermore, the `Query.build_filter` method is significant for overall query construction and filtering, which may include `__isnull` lookups. The identified code spans are critical for understanding the current handling of `__isnull` and implementing the required validation for non-boolean values.",

This method is responsible for building the SQL WHERE clause for filters, including the handling of the ISNULL lookup. The condition logic within this method checks the type of lookup and its right-hand side (rhs) value. Currently, it only checks if rhs is True or False for the ISNULL lookup.
