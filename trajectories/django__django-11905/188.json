The predominant focus should be on the IsNull class and its methods, especially the as_sql method, where the SQL generation for 'IS NULL' and 'IS NOT NULL' checks happens. Additionally, the __init__ method of the Lookup class is relevant for initial validation and the process_rhs method for handling the right-hand side values. The search results include several code spans that are likely relevant: the IsNull class definition in 'django/db/models/lookups.py', the as_sql method of the IsNull class, and the process_rhs methods of both the Lookup and FieldGetDbPrepValueIterableMixin classes. These are central to understanding how the 'isnull' lookup and other lookups process their right-hand side values.

Using truthy/falsey doesn't promote INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN but works fine for a simple queries. Using non-boolean values is \u200bundocumented and untested. IMO we should raise an error for non-boolean values to avoid confusion and for consistency.\n"
