From the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are those dealing directly with the IsNull class and its as_sql method. The IsNull class is defined in django/db/models/lookups.py and is used in django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py. It's crucial to find where the validation of the input to the IsNull lookup happens. The current code in the IsNull class assumes the rhs (right-hand side) value is boolean and does not validate this assumption. However, as per the issue, we should introduce a validation to ensure the rhs is strictly boolean before proceeding with the IS NULL or IS NOT NULL SQL operations. This requires changes in the IsNull class where it checks the value of rhs to ensure it's either explicitly True or False. The RelatedIsNull class in django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py inherits from the IsNull class and is also likely to require similar validation. This detailed analysis shows that the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the issue, primarily in django/db/models/lookups.py and corroborated indirectly in django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py. While the current code spans are relevant, further steps would require implementing the validation logic directly into these code locations to handle non-boolean values appropriately, either by correcting the inputs or raising an appropriate error.",

Using truthy/falsey doesn't promote INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN but works fine for a simple queries. Using non-boolean values is \u200bundocumented and untested. IMO we should raise an error for non-boolean values to avoid confusion and for consistency.\n"
