This requirement aligns with the `IsNull` class and its method `as_sql` in the `django/db/models/lookups.py` file. The method `as_sql` is responsible for generating the SQL based on the condition provided. The current implementation of `as_sql` assumes `self.rhs` is a boolean, which aligns with the desired functionality but lacks a check to enforce this. Given that the issue emphasizes the need for a check to prevent non-boolean values, the code span for `IsNull.as_sql` is relevant. The `BuiltinLookup` class and other nearby code might also be relevant if they handle or influence the behavior of the `IsNull` lookup, which emphasizes the importance of reviewing surrounding code for complete context. Based on this understanding, the identified code spans encompass the `IsNull` class and its `as_sql` method, so these spans are selected for their alignment with the reported issue.",
