In the provided search results, the IsNull class is located within the django/db/models/lookups.py file, as expected from the file context. Besides the definition of the IsNull class, there is also a specific method `as_sql` that controls how the SQL for this lookup is generated. This method checks the value of `self.rhs` to decide whether to use 'IS NULL' or 'IS NOT NULL'. Ensuring that `self.rhs` is always a boolean to maintain consistency and avoid confusion directly aligns with the reported issue.
