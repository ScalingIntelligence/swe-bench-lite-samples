The analysis involves examining the 'IsNull' class within the 'lookups.py' file from the search results. This class is responsible for handling the '__isnull' lookup. The method 'as_sql' in this class currently checks the truthiness of the 'self.rhs' to determine whether to evaluate to 'IS NULL' or 'IS NOT NULL'. This could be problematic if 'self.rhs' is not strictly a boolean value, as the issue suggests. Therefore, the code span related to the 'IsNull.as_sql' method is relevant as it directly addresses the logic used for the '__isnull' lookup. Although it doesn't explicitly handle non-boolean values, modifying this method would likely be part of the solution to ensure only boolean values are accepted for the '__isnull' lookup.",
