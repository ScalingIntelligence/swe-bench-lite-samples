There's also the build_lookup method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', which seems to handle the creation of lookups and could potentially be modified to enforce the non-boolean value restriction. The build_filter method similarly deals with constructing filters, which is relevant since __isnull might be used within filter conditions.

Using truthy/falsey doesn't promote INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN but works fine for a simple queries. Using non-boolean values is \u200bundocumented and untested. IMO we should raise an error for non-boolean values to avoid confusion and for consistency.\n"
