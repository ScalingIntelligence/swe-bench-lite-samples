In `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, the `build_filter` method is responsible for constructing filters, which includes handling the __isnull lookup. 3. In `django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py`, the `RelatedIsNull` class extends the `IsNull` lookup for related fields.

IMO we should raise an error for non-boolean values to avoid confusion and for consistency.\n"
