The search results provide insights into how the '__isnull' lookup is currently implemented and used within Django's ORM. Key findings include the IsNull class definition in 'django/db/models/lookups.py', which defines the behavior for the '__isnull' lookup. Additionally, 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' contains logic for building lookups, including handling of the '__isnull' lookup. The 'Query.build_lookup' method checks for valid lookup values, which could be relevant for implementing a validation to ensure only boolean values are allowed for the '__isnull' lookup. The provided context currently does not identify any relevant code, leaving this search necessary for addressing the issue. The search results align well with the issue, especially the IsNull class and the build_lookup method in 'query.py', suggesting these are crucial points for enforcing the new requirement. It is recommended to focus on these areas for further implementation of checks to ensure the '__isnull' lookup only accepts boolean values.",

In the provided context, the key focus is the `IsNull` class within `django/db/models/lookups.py`, which handles the `isnull` lookup. It currently allows `True` or `False` as valid right-hand side (rhs) values, but there's no validation to ensure that only boolean values are used. This is the primary area of concern, as highlighted by the issue. In addition, the `IsNull.as_sql` method defines how SQL is generated for the `isnull` lookup, but it doesn't enforce type checking on the rhs. The search results include another occurrence of the `IsNull` lookup in `RelatedIsNull` within `django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py`. Given that the core logic of `isnull` is identical, this suggests that both implementations might need a similar fix to restrict rhs values to strictly boolean types. The relevance of the additional `RelatedIsNull` class results because it's derived from the same `IsNull` class and would logically exhibit the same behavior regarding rhs value acceptance. Therefore, both locations appear relevant for addressing the issue.",

Additionally, the 'build_lookup' method within 'query.py' appears to manage the creation of lookups, including handling cases where the RHS of the lookup might be None. This suggests that the logic for checking and managing non-boolean values for the 'isnull' lookup might be partly handled here as well, particularly in how it deals with 'None' values to ensure the correct SQL is generated.
