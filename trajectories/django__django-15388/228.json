This affects the autoreload mechanism of Django, which should detect changes to settings.py and restart the server accordingly. The search results focus on the autoreload utility in django/utils/autoreload.py, which is the central piece for managing automatic reloading in Django. The identified spans cover core functionalities like iterating over module files, getting child arguments for subprocesses, triggering reloads, restarting with a reloader, and notification of file changes. Each of these functions plays a crucial role in the autoreload process, and any disruption in these mechanisms can lead to the server not restarting. The spans also include the definition of the base reloader class and its method for notifying file changes, which is directly related to the issue reported. This comprehensive review of the autoreload functionality suggests that the problem could be rooted in how the system detects changes, notifies, or attempts to reload after changes are detected. The identified spans in django/utils/autoreload.py are relevant and could provide insights into why the autoreload mechanism fails under the given conditions.",
