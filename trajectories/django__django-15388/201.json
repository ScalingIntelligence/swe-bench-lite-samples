This could be due to how the autoreload feature is implemented or configured within Django. The relevant files to focus on are those handling autoreloading, specifically those in the autoreload.py module where the reloading logic is defined and in the runserver.py command where the server is actually started. Since the issue is with the autoreload functionality not triggering upon changes, and particularly when modifying template directories, it's crucial to pinpoint where the change detection might be failing. Therefore, the logical next step would be to look into specific functions in the autoreload module such as 'trigger_reload', 'restart_with_reloader', and methods in the BaseReloader and StatReloader classes since these components are responsible for detecting file changes and managing the reloading process. Additionally, checking the inner_run method in the runserver command could provide insights into how the autoreload is initialized and managed when the server starts.",

The code spans include functions like `restart_with_reloader`, `trigger_reload`, and the `Command.handle` method, which are directly related to managing the server and reacting to changes. The issue seems to be that after modifying settings.py, the autoreload system does not trigger a server restart as expected. The identified spans provide context around how the autoreload system is designed to work, which will be crucial for further debugging or fixing this issue. Therefore, based on the relevance of these spans to the issue, they should be included in the analysis for a more targeted investigation.",

Manually CTRL-C your dev server (as it won't restart on its own when you save), restart the dev server. Now return to your settings.py file, re-save it, and notice the development server once again detects changes and restarts.\nThis bug prevents the dev server from restarting no matter where you make changes - it is not just scoped to edits to settings.py.\n"
