The current context already highlights the relevant file 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py' and 'django/utils/feedgenerator.py'. The search results provide further details in these files, especially in the 'SyndicationFeed' class within 'feedgenerator.py', which includes the 'add_item' method that currently supports the 'comments' parameter but is not utilized in the views. The inclusion of the 'comments' parameter in 'add_item' indicates that the functionality is partially implemented but not directly accessible from the views. This suggests that the next step would be to modify the 'Feed' class in 'views.py' to directly support adding 'comments' when adding an item to the feed. This implementation aligns with the goal of facilitating the addition of 'comments' directly through 'feed.add_item()' without needing to use 'item_extra_kwargs'.",
