Reviewing the provided files, it is evident that the 'add_item' method in 'django/utils/feedgenerator.py' already has a 'comments' parameter, which suggests that the functionality could already be partially implemented. However, the 'Feed' class in 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py' does not directly leverage this parameter. Hence, the focus should be on enhancing 'Feed' and related methods to utilize the 'comments' parameter effectively, possibly including modifications to 'item_extra_kwargs' or introducing new methods if necessary.",
