The method `add_item` in `SyndicationFeed` class already has a placeholder for `comments`. To address the issue, we need to ensure that `feed.add_item()` in `syndication.views` can define `item_comments` directly. Additionally, the `comments` argument is mentioned in `feedparser` but not implemented in the view. The search should focus on the `django/contrib/syndication/views.py` file where the `Feed` class is located, as this is where the method `add_item` is defined for use in views.
