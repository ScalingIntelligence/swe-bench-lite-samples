Specifically, the issue points out the need to add a 'comments' argument to the feed.add_item() method in the syndication.views module. This change should allow the definition of item_comments directly without needing to use item_extra_kwargs as an intermediate step. Additionally, the issue mentions that comments are already explicitly mentioned in the feedparser but not implemented in the view. Given this context, I proceeded to analyze the provided search results. The search results include various parts of the Feed class in the syndication.views module, notably the Feed.get_feed method where items are added to the feed. This is a critical part of the codebase where the modification should take place to integrate the comments argument. The existing code for adding items in the Feed class does not currently include a 'comments' argument in the call to feed.add_item. Therefore, this makes the Feed.get_feed method a relevant target for modifications to align with the requirements of the reported issue.",
