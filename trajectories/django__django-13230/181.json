The 'add_item' method within the 'Feed' class is already explicitly defined, which suggests that the implementation for adding comments might be feasible within this method. The next step would involve inspecting this method's current implementation to understand how the 'comments' argument could potentially be integrated, or to determine if it already exists and needs modification. Given the current context, the search can be considered completed as the targeted method has been located.",
