This involves modifying the `Feed` class and specifically the `get_feed` method where items are iterated and added to the feed. Comparing the file context and the search results, it is clear that the relevant spans are already identified in the file context, and the search results merely provide a more detailed version of the same code. The `add_item` method within the `get_feed` method is where the modification needs to be made to include the new `comments` argument. Since the necessary context for understanding this part of the codebase is already provided in the file context, no new spans need to be identified from the search results.",
