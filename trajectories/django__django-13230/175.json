This enhancement would allow the `item_comments` to be defined directly without needing to go through `item_extra_kwargs`. The search results contain relevant code spans in the `django/contrib/syndication/views.py` file, particularly the `Feed` class which includes the `add_item()` method. This method currently accepts parameters such as title, link, description, etc., and it is here where the 'comments' argument should be added. Additionally, the `Feed` class has methods like `item_extra_kwargs` which currently handle extra arguments for items, and this method would no longer be needed for comments if the direct argument implementation is accepted. This analysis shows that the relevant code spans are focused on the functionality of adding items to the feed and how extra arguments for items are handled; thus, these spans provide a solid foundation for implementing the requested enhancement.",
