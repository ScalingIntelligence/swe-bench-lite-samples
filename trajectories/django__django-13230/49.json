Specifically, the request is to add a 'comments' argument to the 'feed.add_item()' method in the syndication.views module to avoid the need to go through 'item_extra_kwargs'. After reviewing the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are found in 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py' and 'django/utils/feedgenerator.py'. In 'django/utils/feedgenerator.py', the 'SyndicationFeed.add_item' method already has a 'comments' parameter, which suggests that the functionality is partially there but likely needs to be integrated or exposed in the view layer. The 'Feed' class in 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py' is a good candidate to modify to add this new argument, ensuring that 'item_comments' can be directly defined when adding an item to the feed. Therefore, the relevant spans to focus on are the ones related to the 'Feed' class in 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py' and the 'SyndicationFeed.add_item' method in 'django/utils/feedgenerator.py'.",
