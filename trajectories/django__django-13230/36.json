Specifically, it involves modifying the `feed.add_item()` method in `syndication.views` to include a `comments` argument, thus allowing `item_comments` to be defined directly without needing to use `item_extra_kwargs`. Additionally, it notes that comments are already mentioned in the feedparser but not implemented in the view.\n\nUpon examining the search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are located in two files: `django/contrib/syndication/views.py` and `django/utils/feedgenerator.py`. Within `views.py`, the `Feed` class is defined, which is likely where the modification to `feed.add_item()` should occur. In `feedgenerator.py`, the `SyndicationFeed` class is defined, which includes the `add_item` method. This method already has a `comments` argument, suggesting that the existing framework supports comments but they are not being utilized or exposed in the intended way in `syndication.views`.\n\nTherefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue are located in the `add_item` method of the `SyndicationFeed` class in `feedgenerator.py` and potentially in the `Feed` class in `syndication.views.py` where the `add_item` method might need to be overridden or adjusted to directly include the `comments` argument as requested.",
