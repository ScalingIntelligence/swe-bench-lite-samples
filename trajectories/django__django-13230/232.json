The current search results provide a comprehensive overview of the Feed class in django/contrib/syndication/views.py, which is highly relevant as it contains the methods for handling items in the feed. Specifically, the span identified by 'Feed.get_feed' is crucial as it outlines the process of adding items to the feed and where the new 'comments' argument could be integrated. This span includes the current implementation of the 'add_item' method, which lacks the 'comments' parameter. Additionally, the span 'Feed.item_extra_kwargs' is relevant because the current method of handling extra kwargs for items could be simplified if direct arguments like 'comments' were supported. Further analysis of the entire section is necessary to ensure that modifications do not inadvertently affect other aspects of the feed generation process. Since the relevant code to implement the new feature is found within the 'Feed' class, the task can be considered complete in terms of identifying the necessary regions of the codebase to modify. However, the task of actually implementing the new feature is beyond the scope of this identification process.",
