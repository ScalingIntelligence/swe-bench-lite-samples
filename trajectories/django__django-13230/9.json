This would allow item_comments to be defined directly without going through item_extra_kwargs. The search results include relevant code spans in two files: 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py' and 'django/utils/feedgenerator.py'. The 'Feed' class in 'views.py' is likely where the modification will be implemented, as it is part of the syndication framework. The 'SyndicationFeed' class in 'feedgenerator.py' already includes an 'add_item' method that has a 'comments' parameter, indicating that the functionality for supporting comments at the feed item level is already partially implemented. This makes the 'add_item' method in 'SyndicationFeed' highly relevant to the reported issue. To fully address the issue, it would be necessary to modify the 'Feed' class in 'views.py' to pass the 'comments' argument to the 'add_item' method, as it currently does not include this functionality. Therefore, both the 'Feed' class and the 'add_item' method in 'SyndicationFeed' are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
