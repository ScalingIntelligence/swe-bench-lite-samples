This task requires examining the 'add_item' method in detail to ensure that 'comments' can be properly integrated and utilized. After reviewing the search results, we find that the 'add_item' method within 'SyndicationFeed' class already has a 'comments' parameter. This suggests that the framework already supports the 'comments' attribute, but it might not be fully utilized or documented. The immediate task could involve updating 'syndication.views' to ensure 'item_comments' can be defined through 'add_item' directly, simplifying the process over using 'item_extra_kwargs'.
