This includes explicitly implementing the support for comments in the view as they are already mentioned in the feedparser. The relevant files seem to be located in the `django/contrib/syndication` directory, particularly `views.py` and potentially `feedgenerator.py`. The focus should be on the `Feed` class and `SyndicationFeed` class, specifically the `add_item()` method in `SyndicationFeed`. Additionally, the `item_extra_kwargs()` method in the `Feed` class might also need attention as it is currently used to detour the setting of item comments. Therefore, the search should be conducted primarily in these classes and methods to identify where the comments support should be added or modified.",

The key element to focus on is the 'add_item' method within the 'Feed' class or its related methods in 'syndication.views'. From the provided search results, 'syndication.views.py' contains the 'Feed' class with methods like 'item_title', 'item_description', and 'item_link', which are relevant as they deal with items in the feed context. Notably, the 'Feed.item_extra_kwargs' method is of interest because it handles extra keyword arguments for items, suggesting a potential location to integrate the 'comments' argument directly. Additionally, the 'SyndicationFeed' class in 'feedgenerator.py' includes an 'add_item' method that already has a 'comments' parameter, confirming that some feed parsers require or include comments but allow for future enhancements without precluding future modifications to include a 'comments' parameter in the 'Feels' feed type/structure. Focusing on these classes and methods would be necessary for allowing 'comments' within item kwargs simpler and directly in the view.",

Relevant code spans are identified in both `django/contrib/syndication/views.py` and `django/utils/feedgenerator.py`. In `django/contrib/syndication/views.py`, the `Feed` class needs to be updated, particularly the `get_feed()` method where items are added to the feed. This involves integrating the `comments` parameter into the `add_item()` call within `get_feed()`. In `django/utils/feedgenerator.py`, the `add_item()` method of the `SyndicationFeed` class already supports the `comments` parameter, so this part is already implemented. The current search results confirm the existence of these methods and their structure, thus supporting the direct addition of the `comments` argument to `feed.add_item()` in the context of generating syndication feeds.
