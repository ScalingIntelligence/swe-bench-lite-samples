This method already has a 'comments' parameter, which means the framework technically supports comments but it might not be used or implemented in the views yet.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Feed' class in 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py' under the span id 'Feed' is identified as a potential place to add the implementation for supporting comments directly in the view, considering it does not currently pass the 'comments' parameter to the 'add_item()' method.

This involves modifying the `add_item` method in the `SyndicationFeed` class to directly accept the `comments` argument, avoiding the need to use `item_extra_kwargs`. The search results provide context around the `Feed` class and its methods in 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py', which includes the `add_item` method where the functionality needs to be implemented. The current `add_item` method does have a `comments` parameter, so it seems like the main task is to ensure that this parameter can be used directly when items are added. The provided search results do not appear to contain the necessary code spans directly related to the `comments` parameter implementation, as they focus more on other aspects of the Feed class and its related methods. However, the results do provide a comprehensive view of the Feed class, which is necessary for understanding the context in which the `comments` parameter should be integrated. Thus, while these results may not directly address the issue, they are relevant to the overall modification context required to make the change.",
