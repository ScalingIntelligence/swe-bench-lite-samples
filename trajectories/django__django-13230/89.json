The search results include relevant code spans in two files: django/contrib/syndication/views.py and django/utils/feedgenerator.py. In views.py, the Feed class contains the get_feed method where the feed.add_item() method is called. This method call does not currently include the comments parameter as required by the issue. The relevant span is 'Feed.get_feed', which is already identified in the file context. Additionally, in feedgenerator.py, the SyndicationFeed class contains the add_item method that actually adds an item to the feed. This method already includes the comments parameter, even though it is not yet used in the views.py file. The relevant span here is 'SyndicationFeed.add_item'. These findings indicate that the existing code infrastructure supports the addition of comments, and the task is to update the Feed.get_feed method in views.py to include the comments parameter in its call to feed.add_item(). This search is thus complete for identifying the relevant parts of the codebase that need to be updated to add comments support.",
