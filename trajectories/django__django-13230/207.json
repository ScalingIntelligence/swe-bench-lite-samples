By examining the provided search results, I've identified relevant code spans that can lead to the implementation of this feature. The 'Feed' class in 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py' is the main class handling syndication, and it already includes 'feed_type' as 'feedgenerator.DefaultFeed'. In 'django/utils/feedgenerator.py', the 'SyndicationFeed' class includes the 'add_item' method which already has a parameter 'comments'. This suggests that the comments functionality is already acknowledged in the design but might not be utilized to its full potential in the context of the Feed class or view methods. Thus, these code spans directly address the requirement to add support for 'item_comments' by leveraging or enhancing the existing 'comments' parameter in the 'add_item' method. The identified spans provide a strong foundation and context for making the necessary updates.",
