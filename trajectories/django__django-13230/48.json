Specifically, the task requires adding a 'comments' argument to the `feed.add_item()` method in `syndication.views`. From the provided search results, there are two main files: 'django/contrib/syndication/views.py' and 'django/utils/feedgenerator.py'. In 'views.py', the `Feed` class is defined, which likely interacts with the syndication framework. However, the actual implementation of `add_item` is found in 'feedgenerator.py' under the `SyndicationFeed` class. This class contains the `add_item` method that currently has a 'comments' parameter but it seems not to be utilized directly in the view. This matches the requirement to allow item_comments to be defined directly without the detour via item_extra_kwargs. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those in 'feedgenerator.py' that relate to the `add_item` method and its parameters, including the 'comments' parameter.",

Now, we need to find the relevant code in the file django/contrib/syndication/views.py to determine how this SyndicationFeed class is used. Analyzing the search results, we find that the Feed class in django/contrib/syndication/views.py uses SyndicationFeed in its get_feed method to add items to the feed.
