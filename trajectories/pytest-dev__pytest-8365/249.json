This problem arises because `getpass.getuser()` is used to determine the `basetemp` directory, which can return a username with characters that are not allowed in directory names, such as a domain-prefixed username like 'contoso\\john_doe'. This leads to errors when trying to create the temporary directory. The relevant parts of the codebase that need to be examined are those that handle the creation of temporary directories and the determination of the `basetemp` directory, particularly where `getpass.getuser()` is used or where the `basetemp` directory is set or used. From the search results, these relevant parts include `TempPathFactory`, `TempdirFactory`, `get_user`, `pytest_configure`, `tmpdir_factory`, `tmp_path_factory`, and `tmp_path`, as they all deal with the creation and handling of temporary directories or involve the use of `getpass.getuser()`. The initial step is to ensure that the usernames are sanitized or handled in a way that prevents illegal characters from causing issues, possibly by removing or substituting illegal characters.",
