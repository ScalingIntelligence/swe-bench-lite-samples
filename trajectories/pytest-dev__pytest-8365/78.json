The problem arises when the username contains illegal characters for directory names, leading to errors. The user name is obtained from `getpass.getuser()`, and when it contains characters like '\\' (as can happen with domain usernames), it causes the temp directory creation to fail. The error is specifically related to the `mkdir` function in `pathlib.py`. To address this, we need to locate the relevant functions and classes in the pytest source code that handle the creation of temporary directories and the retrieval of the username. The relevant files seem to be `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` and possibly `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`.",

The username is obtained using `getpass.getuser()`, which can return usernames with characters not allowed in directory names. The relevant code spans in the search results suggest that both `tmp_path_factory` and `tmpdir_factory` fixtures rely on the `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` classes, respectively, to create temporary directories by making use of the `get_user()` function, which obtains the username using `getpass.getuser()`. The `TempPathFactory.getbasetemp()` method constructs the base temporary directory path using the username received from the `get_user()` function, which forms the base of the temporary directory. The `TempPathFactory.mktemp()` method creates a temporary directory using this base temporary directory, and is part of the critical path where the failure occurs. Therefore, the span IDs related to these methods are crucial for addressing the issue. Additionally, the `get_user()` function span ID is critical as it directly uses `getpass.getuser()` to retrieve the username, which is the root cause of the problem when an illegal character is present in the username. The other methods related to the `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` may also be consulted but are of secondary importance compared to `get_user()` to solve the core issue at hand.",

  "initial_message": "tmpdir creation fails when the username contains illegal characters for directory names\n`tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory` and `tmp_path_factory` rely on `getpass.getuser()` for determining the `basetemp` directory. I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n"
