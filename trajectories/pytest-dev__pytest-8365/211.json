This issue is related to `tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory`, and `tmp_path_factory` in pytest, which rely on `getpass.getuser()` to determine the `basetemp` directory. The key function here is `getpass.getuser()`, which may return user names containing characters not allowed in directory names. The provided search results include several files and spans of code, but the most relevant ones are those that directly deal with the creation and management of temporary directories.\n\nFrom the search results, the following code spans are relevant:\n\n1. `TempPathFactory` and its methods in `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` - This class and its methods handle the creation and management of temporary paths, which is directly related to the issue.\n2. `TempdirFactory` in the same file - This class handles the temporary directory creation and is linked to `TempPathFactory`, making it relevant.\n3. `get_user()` function in `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` - This function uses `getpass.getuser()` and is likely where the problematic username is retrieved.\n4. `pytest_configure` function in `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` - This function initializes the `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory`, so understanding where and how the `basetemp` is determined and used is crucial.\n\nThese spans of code are directly involved in the process that leads to the creation of temporary directories, making them the most relevant to the reported issue. Other files and spans, such as those in `src/_pytest/cacheprovider.py`, `src/_pytest/config/__init__.py`, etc., although they have a `pytest_configure` function, are not directly related to `tmpdir` creation and management, hence less relevant for this issue.",
