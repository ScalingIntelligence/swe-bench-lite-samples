The user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may contain illegal characters for directory names, leading to errors when creating the temporary directory. This issue is particularly observed when using an SSH connection on Windows, where the domain username may contain characters like '\\', which are illegal in directory names.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, the relevant sections of the codebase can be identified:\n1. `TempPathFactory` class is responsible for handling the temporary paths, including the creation of the `basetemp` directory.\n2. The `get_user()` function, which calls `getpass.getuser()` to retrieve the username, is relevant as it directly contributes to the issue by returning the problematic username.\n3. The `TempPathFactory.getbasetemp()` method is crucial as it constructs the `basetemp` directory using the username obtained from `get_pass.getuser()`. The method normalizes the username and associates it with the temporary directory, which if containing illegal characters, leads to the reported error.\n4. The `mktemp` method in both `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` classes create temporary directories and may be places where errors occur due to the illegal characters in the username.\n\nUnderstanding which parts of the codebase are involved in determining or using the `basetemp` directory, as well as where username sanitization may need improvement, is important to address the issue effectively. Given the search results, there are significant sections of the codebase related to the problem, particularly in temp directory creation and configuration settings involving the user name, which should be inspected for further action. Additional checks or modifications might be needed in the `TempPathFactory.getbasetemp()` method, and possibly elsewhere, to ensure that usernames with illegal characters do not cause filesystem errors.",

I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n"
