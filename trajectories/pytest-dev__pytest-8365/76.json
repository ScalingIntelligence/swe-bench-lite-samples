            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the use of `getpass.getuser()` which returns a username that may contain illegal characters for directory names, causing failures in creating temporary directories. To address this, we need to find the relevant code spans where `getpass.getuser()` is used to determine the `basetemp` directory, and the methods where temporary directories are created. From the search results, we can identify several key areas:\n1. In `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`, the `TempPathFactory` class constructs the base temporary directory based on the `given_basetemp`, which might be derived from `getpass.getuser()`. Specifically, the `__init__` and `mktemp` methods of `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` should be examined closely as they could be involved in setting up and creating temporary directories.\n2. In `src/_pytest/pytester.py`, the `Pytester` class uses `tmp_path_factory.mktemp` which links back to the `TempPathFactory`'s methods, indicating these are relevant in determining how temporary directories are created in tests. The `__init__` method of `Pytester` and `Testdir` could also be places where the issue manifests.\n3. The `get_user` function, also present in `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`, directly calls `getpass.getuser()`, making it a critical part of the identified issue concerning the user name extraction. This function needs to be adjusted or handled appropriately to ensure it does not return invalid characters for directory paths.\n\nBy identifying these spans, we can see that the core functionality related to temporary directory creation and the use of `getpass.getuser()` are well represented among these files. Further analysis and possible modifications in these key spans could help to resolve the issue.",

This confirms that the code related to temporary directory creation and the potential pitfalls involving getpass.getuser() are indeed relevant to the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "tmpdir creation fails when the username contains illegal characters for directory names\n`tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory` and `tmp_path_factory` rely on `getpass.getuser()` for determining the `basetemp` directory. I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n"
