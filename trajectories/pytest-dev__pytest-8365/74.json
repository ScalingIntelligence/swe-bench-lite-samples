Specifically, `TempPathFactory`, `TempdirFactory`, `get_user`, `pytest_configure`, `tmpdir_factory`, `tmp_path_factory`, `tmpdir`, and `tmp_path` functions in `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` will be examined. Additionally, the `mkdir` function in `src/_pytest/pathlib.py` where the error occurred should also be considered.

The key components pointed out are `tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory`, `tmp_path_factory`, and `getpass.getuser()`. The situation described involves a Windows configuration where the username returned by `getpass.getuser()` includes illegal characters, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. The search results contain several relevant code spans that suggest where the issue may lie:\n1. `TempPathFactory`; 2. `TempPathFactory.from_config`; and 3. `get_user`.\n\nThese spans collectively show how temporary paths are managed, how the factory is configured, and how the user is retrieved. Particularly, the `get_user` function directly involves `getpass.getuser()`, which is central to the issue. Understanding how this function interacts with the temp directory creation logic is crucial. The `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` classes also play a significant role in handling these temporary directories.\n\nBy analyzing these spans, it is clear that they are relevant to the reported issue: they show how the temporary directory is managed, configured, and how the username might affect its creation. Therefore, these spans should be identified as relevant to the issue.",

I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n"
