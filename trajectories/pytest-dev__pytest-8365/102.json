The `pytest_configure` function in the same file might also be relevant as it sets up the configuration for pytest. Additionally, the `pathlib.py` module might be involved in the actual directory creation, especially the `mkdir` function which raises the `FileNotFoundError`. It might be useful to look into these functions and modules to find where the user name processing might be going wrong and how to handle illegal characters.",

The search results provide several key pieces of code that are relevant to this issue. First, the `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` classes are central to the creation of temporary directories in pytest. The method `TempPathFactory.from_config` initializes the `TempPathFactory` with the configuration, which includes the `basetemp` directory determined by the user configuration. This setup is crucial as it directly interacts with the temporary directory creation process. Secondly, the `get_user` function is directly involved in fetching the username using `getpass.getuser()`, which can return a username that includes illegal characters for directory names, leading to the reported issue. The `pytest_configure` function sets up the configuration for pytest, including the `_tmp_path_factory` and `_tmpdirhandler`, using `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` respectively. This setup involves the creation of temporary directories and could fail if illegal characters are present in the username. The `Pytester` class in `pytester.py` also involves the creation of temporary directories and could be impacted by the username issue. The `mkdir` methods in both `Pytester` and `Testdir` directly create directories, making them relevant to the issue. Given these connections, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the areas that need to be addressed to resolve the reported issue.",

I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n"
