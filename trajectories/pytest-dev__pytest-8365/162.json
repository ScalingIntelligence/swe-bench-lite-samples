This seems to be primarily caused by the username returned when logged in through an SSH connection on Windows, which includes a backslash (e.g., `contoso\\john_doe`). This username is used to create a base temporary directory, leading to the `FileNotFoundError`. To address this, the search should focus on the code responsible for handling temporary directory creation and username retrieval within pytest. Specifically, the `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` classes, along with the `get_user` function, are crucial. Additionally, the error message indicates an issue in the `pathlib` module when attempting to create a directory, so investigating the `pathlib` handling within pytest is also important.",

The critical aspect identified in the context and search results is the usage of `getpass.getuser()` to determine the `basetemp` directory, which is problematic when the user name contains characters like '\\'. This issue is explicitly addressed in the `get_user()` function within `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`. The `TempPathFactory` class and its method `getbasetemp()` are also relevant, as they handle the creation of the base temporary directory and involve the `get_user()` function. Additionally, the fixture `tmp_path_factory` which relies on `TempPathFactory` is crucial as it directly relates to the creation of temporary paths during tests. No new code spans were identified from the search results that significantly add to the understanding of the issue, but they support the existing context by showing the integral parts of the pytest system that interact with temporary directories. The current code spans sufficiently cover the concern articulated in the issue's description.",
