The failure occurs specifically when the username includes characters that are not allowed in directory names, such as backslashes in the domain username format 'contoso\\john_doe'. The search results include several relevant code spans from `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py` that handle the configuration and creation of temporary directories. These spans include methods and class initializations that directly relate to the behavior described in the issue, such as `TempPathFactory.from_config` which initializes the `TempPathFactory` based on the pytest configuration, and the `TempdirFactory` class which uses the `TempPathFactory` for handling temporary paths. These pieces of code are directly involved in setting up the temporary directory path based on the user's environment and are thus highly relevant to the issue. Additionally, the `pytest_configure` function, which sets up the `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` in the pytest configuration, is also relevant as it sets the stage for the path creation logic that fails when encountering problematic usernames. Therefore, these code spans provide the necessary context and functionality to understand and potentially address the issue.",
