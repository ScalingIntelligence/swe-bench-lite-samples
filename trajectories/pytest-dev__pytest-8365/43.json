This failure occurs in tools like `tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory`, and `tmp_path_factory`, possibly due to improper handling of characters returned by `getpass.getuser()`. The primary focus should be on the `tmpdir.py` and `pathlib.py` files where the temporary directory creation logic is likely implemented. The error trace also highlights a problem in the `pathlib.py` file where a `FileNotFoundError` is raised. Additionally, the `get_user` function from `tmpdir.py` needs to be inspected for how it handles and uses the output from `getpass.getuser()`. The issue is specific to Windows and involves handling `LOGNAME` settings that include illegal characters. Multiple search parameters should be used, including focusing on the specific module and functions involved, and the exact error message from the traceback to identify the exact location of the problematic code.",

The root cause identified is `getpass.getuser()` returning a username that may contain characters not allowed in directory names. In the provided context, `TempPathFactory.getbasetemp` uses `get_user()` to determine the `basetemp` directory. This is directly relevant to the issue since the username is being used to create a path that might fail due to illegal characters. The newly found `get_user()` function, which calls `getpass.getuser()`, supports this relevance. The issue suggests that handling the username appropriately to avoid illegal characters for directory names could resolve the problem. Considering all these factors, we can conclude that the current context, including the new `get_user()` function, directly addresses the reported issue, sufficiently identifying the relevant code spans in the codebase.",
