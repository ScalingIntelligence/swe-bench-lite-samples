This issue is particularly triggered when `getpass.getuser()` returns a username that includes characters not allowed in directory names, such as a domain username like `contoso\\john_doe`. The analysis of the provided search results reveals relevant code spans that address this problem. The `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` classes are central to the creation of temporary directories in pytest. The `get_user` function is also crucial as it directly uses `getpass.getuser()` to retrieve the username. Additionally, the `pytest_configure` function sets up the temporary directory factory, making it a relevant part of the code that could lead to the error when the username contains illegal characters. Based on these insights, the following code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
