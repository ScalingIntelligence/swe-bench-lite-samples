            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the generation of incorrect C function signatures when using the cython backend for autowrap in SymPy, specifically when array arguments do not appear within the wrapped expression. The primary concern is that these arrays should be represented as 'double *' rather than 'double'. This error is crucial in the context of interfacing with external libraries where pre-defined function signatures are required regardless of the contribution of certain arguments to the final output.\n\nAnalysis of the search results reveals several relevant code spans within `sympy/codegen` that deal with abstract syntax trees (`ast.py`), Fortran node structures (`fnodes.py`), and array utilities (`array_utils.py`). These include code spans handling assignments, loops, function definitions, and array operations, which are directly relevant to the generation of function signatures and the handling of array arguments.\n\nConsidering the issue, the relevant parts of the codebase are those touching on function signature generation and argument handling in the context of code generation and autowrap. The identified spans in `sympy/codegen/ast.py`, `sympy/codegen/fnodes.py`, and `sympy/codegen/array_utils.py` are pivotal as they directly involve the structures and operations related to incorporating arguments into generated functions, particularly those involving array types like 'MatrixSymbol' as a form of array argument that could be misrepresented.\n\nThus, these code spans essentially provide a context where the correction of the identified issue could be effectively placed given their relevance to the flow of data and arguments through the process of generating function signatures for cython's autowrap backend, directly addressing the discrepancy between the theoretical specification of argument types, as according to the SymPy's expression optimization logic, and their practical representation in programmatically generated code that serves as the bridge between high-level mathematical libraries like SymPy and computationally intensive low-level environments facilitated by tools like cython.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are several code spans identified in the search results, the ones in `ast.py`, `fnodes.py`, and `array_utils.py` directly pertain to the structural and functional aspects of handling array-type arguments within function signatures through the autowrap process, making them the most relevant to the resolution of the reported issue. The exploration also suggests the necessity of careful review around these points to ensure that a consistent and correctly typed access between the different representation layers of mathematical objects, as they progress from high-level formal symbolic representations through intermediate, more tightly constrained mathematical graphs, to low-level code entities, is preserved.",

This issue is evident from the provided minimal counterexample where an array argument 'x' is not correctly handled in the generated C code, resulting in a TypeError. The relevant code spans to focus on would be those involved in the generation of Cython code, particularly where the function signatures and argument types are defined. Given the nature of the issue, it is likely that the problem lies within the code responsible for translating SymPy expressions into C code, specifically how array arguments are processed and represented in the C code. From the provided file context and search results, the 'CodegenArrayContraction' class and its methods 'from_MatMul', 'split_multiple_contractions', 'flatten_contraction_of_diagonal', and '_codegen_array_parse' seem relevant as they deal with array contractions and matrix expressions which could be where the misinterpretation of array arguments occurs. Additionally, the 'get_shape' function and the '_parse_matrix_expression' function could also be crucial as they handle the interpretation and parsing of matrix expressions into the internal representation used for code generation. The '_recognize_matrix_expression' function is also relevant as it transforms expressions into a form recognizable for matrix operations, which could impact how array arguments are subsequently processed. Furthermore, the '_unfold_recognized_expr' function is important as it translates these recognized expressions back into their original form, potentially impacting how array arguments are represented in the final code.",

The relevant code spans should focus on the parts of the codebase that deal with the generation of function signatures, matrix expression parsing, and tensor manipulation, as these are likely to be involved in the autowrap functionality. Given the file context, the sympy/codegen/array_utils.py file appears to be relevant with spans like 'CodegenArrayContraction.from_MatMul', 'get_shape', 'CodegenArrayElementwiseAdd' and others. The search results also came from the same file and included spans such as 'CodegenArrayContraction.from_MatMul', 'get_shape', 'CodegenArrayElementwiseAdd', and 'CodegenArrayPermuteDims'. These spans seem to be relevant as they deal with tensor contractions, matrix expressions, and their parsing.

The methods within these classes, such as 'split_multiple_contractions' and 'from_MatMul', play pivotal roles in transforming and generating code for array operations, potentially impacting how the 'autowrap' function processes array arguments for the Cython backend. Additionally, the 'autowrap' function itself is not directly present in the file context, but the presence of array manipulation and code generation utilities suggests that the relevant class and methods responsible for handling array arguments and generating C function signatures could be found here. This indicates that while not every specific detailed method of interest (like 'autowrap' itself) is present, this file context outlines a significant portion of the code responsible for the intricacies within the issue, leading to the conclusion that this context is likely the starting point and well-connected to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
