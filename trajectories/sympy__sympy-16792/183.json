The main problem is that the generated C function has an incorrect signature, where an array argument (`x`) is being incorrectly represented as a scalar (`double`), causing a `TypeError`. The issue can be traced to the `autowrap` function in `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py`. Inspection of the function indicates that it handles argument types and code generation. Additional relevant code spans from `sympy/utilities/codegen.py` show class definitions for `CCodeGen` and `C99CodeGen`, which are likely used in the code generation process. These spans could help in understanding how the C code generation is managed and potentially identify where the issue might be occurring during the conversion from Python to C code.\n\nGiven the context, the primary focus is on the `autowrap` function that orchestrates the wrapping process. The key spans to look at are those involving argument handling and code generation, particularly where the backend is specified as 'cython' and where the C code generation logic resides. This includes the `autowrap` function itself and potentially the `make_routine` function in `codegen.py`, which helps in generating the actual routine.\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided code spans and the reported issue, the identified spans should include those from `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` where the `autowrap` function is defined and operations on arguments are performed. This will help in understanding how the argument types are managed and how the C code is generated, leading to the identification of where the type conversion error might be introduced. Additionally, looking at the `make_routine` function in `codegen.py` will provide insight into the routine generation process, potentially uncovering where the array argument is mishandled.",

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
