The issue arises when using the cython backend and attempting to autowrap a function where the expression does not depend on all arguments. The core of the problem seems to be in the generation of the C function signature. Specifically, when an argument (like `x` in the example) does not appear in the expression, the generated C function has an incorrect signature. The goal is to identify the relevant code spans in the `autowrap` function that handle the argument list and function generation, as well as any related utility functions. The focus should be on sections that involve argument handling, language inference, and code generation. It is also important to verify if there are utility functions elsewhere in the file or module that might directly or indirectly affect this functionality.",

A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
