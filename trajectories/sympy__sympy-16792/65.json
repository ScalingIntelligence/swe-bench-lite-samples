This indicates a problem in how the arguments are interpreted and processed within the autowrap function when generating the C code.

The class LLVMJitCode contains methods for creating functions and converting expressions, which aligns with the issue of incorrect function signatures generated by autowrap when array arguments do not appear in the final expression. Specifically, the _create_function method in LLVMJitCode seems to be responsible for generating the function based on the expression. The error may stem from how arguments are handled, particularly when the expression does not depend on some arguments. This is indicated by the _convert_expr method, which iterates through expressions and potentially misses handling arguments that do not contribute to the final expression. This matches the reported issue of incorrect handling of array arguments. Therefore, the relevant code spans include those related to function creation and expression conversion, which are crucial for identifying the root cause.",

Specifically, the function signature in the generated C code does not correctly represent the type of array arguments, leading to a TypeError when the function is called. The current file context and the new search results provide insights into how the LLVMJitCode and LLVMJitCodeCallback classes handle the creation of function signatures and the conversion of expressions. The _create_function and _convert_expr methods in both contexts are particularly relevant, as they deal with the creation of the function and the conversion of expressions respectively. The incorrect handling of array arguments in the generated C code suggests a possible issue in how the types of arguments are determined and represented in the LLVM IR. The _create_function method in LLVMJitCodeCallback appears to have additional handling for the return argument, which might be a relevant area to investigate further. The provided code spans in the search results are relevant to understanding the code generation process and identifying potential fixes or improvements to correctly handle array arguments in the generated code.",

Specifically, when an array argument in the function does not appear in the final expression, the generated C function has an incorrect signature. The minimal counterexample provided shows that the argument `x` should be of type `double *` instead of `double`. To address this issue, it is necessary to examine the code responsible for generating the function signature and ensure it handles cases where arguments do not appear in the final expression. From the provided search results, we see that the relevant code is primarily located in the `sympy/printing/llvmjitcode.py` file. The identified code spans cover the creation of the function, its parameters, and the conversion of expressions. This includes methods like `_create_function` and `_convert_expr` which are central to the code generation process. These methods need to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that array arguments that do not appear in the final expression are handled correctly. The identified spans are relevant to the reported issue and provide a foundation for further investigation and potential modification to fix the issue.

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
