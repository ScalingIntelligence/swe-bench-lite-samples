            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the incorrect C function signature generated by the autowrap function when using the cython backend. Specifically, the array argument `x` should be of type `double *` but is incorrectly generated as `double`. This typically occurs when the array argument does not appear in the wrapped expression. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that the problem lies within the code generation logic of the autowrap function or the C code printer used by autowrap when the cython backend is specified. Therefore, the focus should be on files related to code generation, autowrap functions, and C code printing within the sympy module.",

The reported issue indicates that the function signature generated by the Cython backend is incorrect, specifically where `x` should be `double *` but is instead `double`. This discrepancy is causing a TypeError when the function is called. \n\nTo solve this, we need to identify the part of the codebase responsible for generating the C function signature. We can begin by examining the search results for the `sympy/printing/ccode.py` file, as this file contains classes responsible for converting SymPy expressions into C code. Specifically, the `C89CodePrinter` class and its methods could be relevant, as they handle the conversion of SymPy types to corresponding C types and function signatures. \n\nReviewing the `type_mappings` dictionary within the `C89CodePrinter` class, it lists various SymPy types and their corresponding C types. This could be a key part of the code that affects how multidimensional array types are converted to C types. Additionally, looking at the `_print_Indexed` method, which deals with indexed expressions (which could be relevant for handling array types in expressions), might provide insight into how array types are handled in the generated C code. \n\nGiven that the reported issue is specific to the Cython backend, the relevant code spans from the search results include those in `sympy/core/backend.py` and `sympy/printing/ccode.py`, particularly where the `C89CodePrinter` class and its methods are defined. However, since the issue involves Cython, we should focus on how SymPy types are mapped to C types in the context of Cython code generation.",

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
