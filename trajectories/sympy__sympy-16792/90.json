The user provides a counterexample where the function is expected to return `1.0` but instead fails. This failure is due to the incorrect C function signature being generated. The relevant section of the search results is the definition of the `autowrap` function. This function is responsible for generating code and handling arguments, which includes the handling of array arguments and their presence in the expression. The problem seems to stem from the `_infer_language` and `_validate_backend_language` functions, as well as the main `autowrap` function logic. The identified spans include the parts of the code where the backend and language are inferred and validated, as well as the main `autowrap` function definition and its internal logic related to argument handling and code generation. These spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue because they directly involve the handling of array arguments and the generation of the correct C function signatures.

The issue specifically points to the `autowrap` function in `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py`.\n\nFrom the provided `search_results`, we see that the `CythonCodeWrapper` class in `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` contains relevant sections that could be related to generating Cython code. The class has methods related to setting up the Cython environment, including handling imports, header files, and function prototypes. These sections might be relevant to understanding how Cython code generation is handled and possibly to fixing the issue.\n\nHowever, the specific problem described in the issue regarding the incorrect handling of array arguments in the generated C code is not directly visible in the provided `search_results`. More context or a deeper look into how arguments are processed and passed into the final Cython-generated C code might be necessary to fully address the issue.\n\nGiven the information, it's clear that the relevant function is `autowrap` and the relevant class for Cython code generation is `CythonCodeWrapper`.

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
