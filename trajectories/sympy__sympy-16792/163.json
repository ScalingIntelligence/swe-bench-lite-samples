The error occurs when the function has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. This results in an incorrect C function signature being generated, specifically `x` being a scalar type (`double`) instead of an array type (`double *`). Given the description, it's likely that the problem lies within the codegen or autowrap modules where the C function signature is defined or generated. We need to search for code that generates the function signature in these areas.",

Given the specificity of the problem, it may be hidden within lesser-used parts of the codebase or require a more detailed examination of the interactions between different modules. The issue involves the incorrect generation of a C function signature when array arguments are present but not used in the expression. This suggests that the problem might be related to how arguments are handled and processed in the autowrap module or perhaps how the C code generation is orchestrated in the codegen module. Since the initial search focused on explicit mentions of function signature generation and the incorrect handling of array arguments, the next logical step might be to broaden the search to include code that deals with argument processing and type checking in the autowrap and codegen modules. Additionally, examining the part of the codebase that might be responsible for determining when arguments are or are not used within expressions could also lead to identifying the problem.",

This problem only occurs when the expression does not depend on the array argument. The search results focus on `sympy.codegen` which is relevant to code generation. The `AssignmentBase._check_args` method checks the types and dimensions of the arguments. However, the search results do not directly address the issue of how the code generation handles expressions that do not depend on all the arguments. Given the context provided, there isn't a clear code span that directly fixes or addresses the issue, but it might involve modifying the logic in `codegen` that determines the C function signature based on the arguments and their use in the expression.",

This suggests that the problem might be related to how arguments are handled and processed in the autowrap module or perhaps how the C code generation is orchestrated in the codegen module.

This discrepancy results in a TypeError. The issue is not directly addressed in the currently provided file contexts, but the search results include relevant code for function generation and argument handling, which might be the starting point for addressing this issue. Specifically, the 'lbound', 'ubound', 'shape', and 'size' functions in sympy/codegen/fnodes.py handle array-related operations and might be relevant to the generation of the correct C function signature. Additionally, the '_codegen_array_parse' function in sympy/codegen/array_utils.py manages the parsing of array expressions which might influence the argument handling in generated code. Lastly, the 'Token' class and its '_sympyrepr' method in sympy/codegen/ast.py handle the representation of code tokens, which might also be involved in correctly representing array types in the generated C code.",

Specifically, the `AssignmentBase` class is central to ensuring type compatibility during assignments, which is critical for correct code generation. However, the challenge lies in interpreting and processing arguments during the autowrap process, particularly when some arguments may not be used in the final expression. Key classes such as `FunctionCall` and methods within `AssignmentBase` offer insights into how code is structured and checked for type compatibility, but concrete traces leading directly to the faulty C code generation in the context of `autowrap` with unused array arguments are yet to be identified. Therefore, a deeper dive into the exact methods in the `autowrap` module that handle the transformation from SymPy expressions to C code, and particularly those that might manage or infer argument types or handle unused arguments, is warranted. Additionally, understanding how the `codegen` module interacts with `autowrap` to handle such unused arguments comprehensively might provide the necessary clues to address the issue.",

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
