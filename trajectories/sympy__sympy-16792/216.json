Specifically, when an array argument does not appear in the final expression, the C function signature incorrectly uses a scalar type instead of a pointer to an array. The provided search results contain code spans that are relevant to the issue, particularly from `sympy.codegen.array_utils.py`. This file contains classes and functions that handle array operations and tensor manipulations, which are crucial for the code generation process in autowrap. The `_codegen_array_parse` function, in particular, is responsible for parsing expressions and determining how they should be handled in the generated code. This function is directly relevant to the issue at hand as it deals with how arrays and indices are managed in the generated code. The `CodegenArrayTensorProduct`, `CodegenArrayElementwiseAdd`, and `CodegenArrayPermuteDims` classes also play a role in how arrays are represented and manipulated in the generated code. These elements suggest that the `sympy.codegen.array_utils.py` file is the primary location where the correction for the issue should be made. Other files in the search results, such as `sympy.codegen.fnodes.py` and `sympy.codegen.__init__.py`, do not directly relate to the issue of generating incorrect C function signatures for array arguments.",

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
