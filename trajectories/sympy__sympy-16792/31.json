The TypeError occurs due to the incorrect generation of the C function signature. The focus should be on the 'autowrap' function and its related modules, specifically looking into how argument types are handled and how the C code is generated. Given the issue, the search should concentrate on the 'sympy.utilities.autowrap' module and related code generation modules such as 'sympy.printing' and 'sympy.codegen'.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the autowrap function with the cython backend generating incorrect C function signatures when array arguments do not appear in the wrapped expression. The minimal counterexample provided shows that the function `autofunc` is incorrectly generated with a signature `double autofunc(double x)` when it should be `double autofunc(double *x)`. This suggests a problem with the way the code generation handles array arguments in the presence of expressions that do not depend on them.\n\nGiven this, the most relevant file seems to be `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py`, specifically the `autowrap` function implementation. This function is responsible for generating code from a given expression using various backends, including cython. The `make_routine` function from `sympy/utilities/codegen.py` and the `get_code_generator` function could also be involved in handling the generation of the C function signature. Additionally, the `code_gen.routine` call within the `autowrap` function might be responsible for creating the incorrect signature. Therefore, the relevant spans are those where the `autowrap` function is defined and where it interacts with the code generation utilities.\n\nThe analysis of `sympy/codegen/cfunctions.py` does not directly relate to the issue at hand as it contains utility functions for C-compatible functions rather than code generation logic. The contents of `sympy/printing/latex.py`, `sympy/printing/str.py`, and `sympy/codegen/fnodes.py` also do not appear to be relevant based on the described issue.\n\nThe `sympy/codegen/array_utils.py` file contains utility functions for parsing and handling array expressions, which might be indirectly related to the problem if the autowrap function makes use of these utilities. However, the specific code spans provided do not directly handle the generation of C function signatures based on the input arguments of the function expression.\n\nGiven the focus on the autowrap functionality and the generation of incorrect C function signatures, I conclude that the relevant spans are located in `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py`.",

The function leverages 'make_routine' and 'get_code_generator' from 'sympy.utilities.codegen' to create necessary functions and code generators. It also handles 'CodeGenArgumentListError' by appending missing output arguments to the argument list, indicating a critical step in managing array arguments. This direct involvement with array arguments and the subsequent generation of C code makes this function a prime suspect for the issue of incorrect C function signature generation. The generation mechanism for C code within this function needs a closer inspection, particularly how 'MatrixSymbol' and array arguments are being processed and translated into the C code's function signature. Focusing on the '_create_function' method within subclasses like 'LLVMJitCodeCallback' or 'UfuncifyCodeWrapper', which are typically responsible for creating the actual function in the generated C code, will be beneficial. This targeted examination aims to pinpoint where the discrepancy between the expected and the generated C function signatures occurs, especially regarding the handling of array arguments.",

However, despite the general structure of the 'autowrap' function being laid out, specific parts about how array arguments and 'MatrixSymbol' types are treated during C code generation are not explicitly detailed in the provided code. Specifically, the generation of the function signature in the C code (where 'x' should be 'double *' instead of 'double') is not shown or referenced directly in the visible part of the code. There is a possibility that the relevant logic for handling array arguments might be embedded deeper within methods not visible in the provided context or in methods of associated classes, such as 'CythonCodeWrapper' or 'CodeGen' classes, which have not been included in the context.",

The generated C function incorrectly infers the type of the array argument as `double` instead of `double *` when the array argument does not appear in the expression. To address this, modifications need to be made directly within the `autowrap` function to ensure proper type inference. It seems that the `make_routine` function or similar is responsible for generating the C function signature, and it incorrectly infers the type of array arguments when they do not appear in the expression, defaulting to `double` for unused array arguments.

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
