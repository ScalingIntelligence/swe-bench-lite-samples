The code provided in the search results includes various classes and utility functions for handling array-related operations, which suggests that the issue might be related to how these operations are being handled or translated into C code. Classes like `CodegenArrayContraction`, `CodegenArrayTensorProduct`, and the permutation handling in `CodegenArrayPermuteDims` likely play crucial roles in generating the correct C code for array operations. Since the issue specifically mentions problems with the signature of the generated C function when array arguments do not appear in the final expression, it would be beneficial to focus on sections of the code that handle these cases, especially where the transformation or simplification of expressions might be ignoring or misinterpreting the presence of certain arguments. The function `_parse_matrix_expression` and `parse_indexed_expression` are also relevant as they deal with parsing and transforming matrix expressions, which could be a key part of generating the correct C code.

This file contains logic for handling array arguments and transformations, which are key to the issue at hand. It's clear from the code that the `CodegenArrayContraction` class and its methods are involved in the contraction and manipulation of array indices, which could be related to how array arguments are handled in the Cython backend. Further inspection of these methods should provide insights into how array arguments are translated into C code and whether checks for unused array arguments are appropriately handled.",

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
