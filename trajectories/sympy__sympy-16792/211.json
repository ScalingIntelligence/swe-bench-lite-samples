Specifically, the problem arises when the expression does not depend on an array argument, causing the generated C function to have an incorrect signature. This is evidenced by the generated C code where the array parameter `x` is incorrectly typed as `double` instead of `double *`. The issue is critical for interfacing with external libraries that require a pre-defined function signature regardless of argument usage in the expression. The analysis of the search results shows that several files may be relevant. The `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` file contains the `autowrap` function definition which is directly related to the issue. Additionally, the `sympy/codegen/array_utils.py` includes utility functions and parsers for array expressions that might be contributing to the issue. Further, the `sympy/printing/pycode.py` and `sympy/printing/__init__.py` files may be indirectly related to code generation issues when using the cython backend. To ensure a thorough diagnosis, it's crucial to review all identified relevant parts, even if they do not directly correspond to the exact issue at hand. This holistic view helps in understanding all connections and effects various pieces of code might have on the specific problem.",

This issue is clearly demonstrated in the provided minimal counterexample where the expression `1.0` does not depend on the array argument `x`. This results in a C function generated with an incorrect signature where `x` is expected to be `double *` but is instead treated as `double`. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that address or are related to this issue. After analyzing the search results, it is apparent that the file `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` contains the relevant code for the `autowrap` function, which is responsible for the autowrap functionality in SymPy. Specifically, the spans within the `autowrap` function are critical as they involve the validation of backend and language compatibility, the determination of code generation, and the handling of routine creation. There are additional context provided in other files like `sympy/codegen/array_utils.py` and `sympy/printing/*.py`, which involve parsing and printing expressions that could be related to how array arguments are processed and represented. However, the core logic handling the generation of wrappers based on the provided expression and its arguments is found within the `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` file.",

  "initial_message": "autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
