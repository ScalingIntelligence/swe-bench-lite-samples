Specifically, when an array argument does not appear in the wrapped expression, the generated C function has an incorrect signature. The analysis of the provided search results shows that the `autowrap` function in `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` is responsible for generating the code for the wrapped expression. It handles the creation of routines and uses a code generator to produce the final function. The relevant code spans include the `autowrap` function itself, which orchestrates the wrapping process, and the `_infer_language` and `_validate_backend_language` functions, which handle the backend and language configuration. However, the primary focus should be on the `autowrap` function, as it contains the logic for creating the routine and managing the arguments, which seems to be where the issue arises when an array argument does not appear in the expression. The current approach in `autowrap` assumes that all arguments contribute to the expression, which does not handle the case where an argument is present but not used in the expression. This discrepancy is likely the cause of the incorrect C function signature in the reported issue.",

The problem described seems to be related to how the 'cython' backend handles array arguments when they do not appear in the expression being auto-wrapped. Specifically, the function '_infer_language' and '_validate_backend_language' are used to determine the language and backend compatibility, which might not fully account for the nuances of handling array types in the generated C code when they do not appear in the expression. Additionally, the 'CodeGenArgumentListError' handling within 'autowrap' suggests that the function attempts to address issues with argument lists, possibly including those related to array arguments. Further inspection of the 'code_gen.routine' method and how it processes array arguments would be beneficial to understand and potentially resolve the issue of incorrect C function signatures.",

The issue is evident in the provided counterexample where the expected C function signature should have the array argument `x` as `double *`, but it is incorrectly generated as `double`.\n\nAnalyzing the provided context, the `autowrap` function in `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` is identified as the main function handling the autowrap process. Within this function, the `routine` method of the `code_gen` object is called to create a routine from the provided expression and arguments. This routine is crucial as it generates the function signature and body in the target language.\n\nThe search results provide further insight into the `routine` method implementations across different code generators in `sympy/utilities/codegen.py`. Each `routine` method is responsible for constructing the routine based on the provided expression, arguments, and possibly global variables. The methods handle the identification of input and output arguments, manage local variables, and ensure the correct sequence of arguments.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the context provided:\n\n1. The `autowrap` function in `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` is already identified as relevant. Specific parts handling the creation of the routine and managing helpers can likely contribute to the issue observed.\n\n2. The `routine` method implementations in `sympy/utilities/codegen.py` are critical as they directly affect how the function signature and body are generated. The methods for `JuliaCodeGen`, `OctaveCodeGen`, `RustCodeGen`, and their handling of arguments and expressions are also relevant.\n\nBased on the alignment with the reported issue, the identified code spans are relevant and can help in understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

A minimal counterexample is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\nexpr = 1.0\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\r\n```python\r\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\r\n```\r\n\r\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\r\n\r\n   double autofunc_result;\r\n   autofunc_result = 1.0;\r\n   return autofunc_result;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\r\n\r\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\r\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\r\n# now output depends on x\r\nexpr = x[0,0]\r\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\r\n\r\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\r\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\r\n\r\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n"
