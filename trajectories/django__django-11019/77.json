The key area to focus on is the merging logic within the `Media` class and any related classes that handle media objects, such as `Widget`. Given the provided context, the main files to investigate are `django/forms/widgets.py` and `django/forms/forms.py`, as they contain classes like `Media` and `Widget` that are directly related to the issue. Additionally, checking for any specific function or method that handles media merging or addition, such as `__add__` in the `Media` class, is crucial. The search should also consider any potential overrides or complex media handling in other files like `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py`.",

            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue of MediaOrderConflictWarnings when merging 3 or more media objects, the focus should be on the Media class and its related methods that handle the merging and ordering of JavaScript files. Specifically, the 'Media.merge' method is crucial as it handles the merging logic and can potentially throw the MediaOrderConflictWarning if it detects files in an opposite order. Other methods such as '__add__' and '_get_media' in the MultiWidget class are also relevant as they deal with combining media objects, which can trigger the warning if not handled correctly. Given the detailed description of the issue and the search results, the following code spans are identified as relevant:\n\n1. 'MediaOrderConflictWarning' - This defines the warning that gets thrown.\n2. 'Media' - The class handling media definitions.\n3. 'Media.__init__' - Initialization of the Media object.\n4. 'Media.merge' - The method responsible for merging media lists and which can throw the warning.\n5. 'Media.__add__' - Method for adding media objects together.\n6. 'MultiWidget._get_media' - Combines media objects, potentially relevant to the issue.\n\nThese spans cover the essential parts of the codebase involved in the reported issue, ensuring a thorough examination of the merging and conflict detection logic.",

  "initial_message": "Merging 3 or more media objects can throw unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following form definition, where text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js but all other JS files are independent:\nfrom django import forms\nclass ColorPicker(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['color-picker.js']\nclass SimpleTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js']\nclass FancyTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']\nclass MyForm(forms.Form):\n\tbackground_color = forms.CharField(widget=ColorPicker())\n\tintro = forms.CharField(widget=SimpleTextWidget())\n\tbody = forms.CharField(widget=FancyTextWidget())\nDjango should be able to resolve the JS files for the final form into the order text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js. However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
