Specifically, the warning occurs when there is a conflict in the order of JS files in the media object of different widgets. For instance, color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js, leading to an unwanted warning. The goal is to identify the code responsible for merging media objects and resolving the order of JS files to avoid such warnings. By examining the files and focusing on the Media class and its methods, we can pinpoint the logic that handles media object merging.",

This warning is triggered due to the order of media files being improperly maintained, leading to erroneous constraints on file order. I examined the provided search results to find the relevant code spans handling the media merging and conflict warnings. The search results include definitions of Media and MediaOrderConflictWarning classes, as well as methods to merge and add media objects. In the django/forms/widgets.py file, the MediaOrderConflictWarning class is defined, showing it's a RuntimeWarning subclass specific to media order conflicts. The Media class includes methods for merging media lists (__init__ and merge), and for combining media objects (__add__). The merge method is particularly relevant as it attempts to merge two lists of media files and checks for conflicts in their order, emitting a MediaOrderConflictWarning if a conflict is detected. This method's logic aligns with the issue's description where the order of files affects the warning's occurrence. The AdminDateWidget and AdminTimeWidget classes in django/contrib/admin/widgets.py were irrelevant to the reported issue since they only define media for admin widgets and do not relate to the merging logic mentioned in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those directly involved in handling and merging media objects and detecting order conflicts.",

The `Media` class, along with its methods such as `__add__`, `merge`, and the static `merge` method, directly address the issue of merging media files and the potential for `MediaOrderConflictWarning`. The logic for combining lists and checking for order conflicts is explicitly detailed in these methods. Specifically, the `merge` method iterates through the lists, detects conflicts, and reports warnings as expected. The setup for media properties and their aggregation through the `media_property` decorator and the `_get_media` method in the `MultiWidget` class also suggest comprehensive handling of media objects.
