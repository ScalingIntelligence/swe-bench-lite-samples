This involves incorrect ordering of JavaScript files during the merging process, which triggers warnings. The search results provide a detailed look into the Media class and its methods, including the merging logic for JavaScript files. This is essential for understanding the current handling of media file orderings and where potential conflicts might arise. The issue mentions the problematic order and suggests that Django should be able to resolve these files correctly. The relevant code spans include the Media class definition, the methods for merging JS files (particularly the merge method), and the warning mechanism. These elements directly address the issue, as they govern how media files are ordered and merged and how conflict warnings are generated. Understanding these methods will be crucial for addressing the issue and ensuring that Django forms handle media files without unnecessary warnings, likely leading to a resolution where the files are ordered correctly and conflicts are resolved without generating false warnings.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
