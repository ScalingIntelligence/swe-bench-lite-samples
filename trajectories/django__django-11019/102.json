The Media class, which handles the management of media files like CSS and JS. 3. The __init__ method of the Media class, which initializes the media objects. 4. The merge method, which is responsible for merging two lists of media files and checking for order conflicts. 5. The __add__ method, which allows the combination of media objects. Given the details in the reported issue, the merge method and __add__ method are particularly relevant as they deal directly with the merging logic and order conflicts. The MediaOrderConflictWarning definition is also relevant as it defines the warning that is raised in case of order conflicts.
