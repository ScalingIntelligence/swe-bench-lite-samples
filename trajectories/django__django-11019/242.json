This issue seems to be primarily related to the management of JS file orders in Django's Media class. Specifically, the problem occurs in how Media files are merged and how conflicting orders are detected.\n\nReviewing the <search_results>, I identify several key parts of the code which directly relate to the issue. The `MediaOrderConflictWarning` indicates where the warning is defined, matching the message described in the issue. The `Media` class and its methods are clearly relevant as they deal directly with media management.\n\nOf particular interest is the `Media.merge` method which performs the actual merging of media lists and checks for order conflicts, emitting the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` when conflicts are found. This method aligns with the operations described in the issue and appears critical to fixing the issue.\n\nAlso, the `Media.__add__` method, dealing with the addition of media objects, seems relevant to the context setup in the issue and could potentially involve where the conflicting lists originate. Given these findings, the identified code spans located in `django/forms/widgets.py` are likely to be the root of the reported issue, specifically in the handling of media files during merging operations.\n\nTherefore, I deduce that the search results provided contain the relevant code spans directly involved in the reported issue concerning Media order conflicts and warnings.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
