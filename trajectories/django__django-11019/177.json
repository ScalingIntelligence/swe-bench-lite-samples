The problem seems to be related to the order in which media files are merged and how conflicts are detected.

The specific method of interest might be `Media.merge`, which is responsible for combining media objects. The error message suggests that there's an issue with the order constraint imposed during the merge. Therefore, the search should focus on these classes and their methods, particularly `Media.merge`.",

The issue is that these warnings are generated under specific circumstances which do not seem to warrant it, leading to confusion and potential incorrect handling of media resource order. The search results revolve around the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` class and the `Media` class, specifically focusing on the `Media.__init__` and `Media.merge` methods. The `Media.merge` method is particularly relevant as it contains the logic for merging media lists and raising the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` when issues arise. This method is where the warning is generated in the scenario described in the issue, and thus it directly addresses the core problem. By identifying these two spans, we can begin to tackle the issue of unnecessary warnings during media merging. I have found 3 spans that directly relate to the handling of Media objects and their merging in Django forms: the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` definition, the `Media.__init__` method for initializing the Media class, and the `Media.merge` method which handles the merging of lists of media files and pertains to the warning logic.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
