The issue describes a scenario where merging media objects in a specific order results in a warning about conflicting orders of media files. The provided search results include several relevant code spans that deal with the Media class, merging media objects, and the warning mechanism. These spans are critical for understanding and addressing the issue. First, the MediaOrderConflictWarning class defines the warning type. Second, the Media class and its __init__ method handle the initialization of media objects. The merge method is particularly relevant as it handles the merging of media lists, which includes logic for detecting and warning about conflicting orders of media files. Lastly, the __add__ method of Media handles the combination of two media objects.\n\nBy examining these code spans, we can determine that they are directly involved in the functionality described by the reported issue. Therefore, these spans should be identified as relevant to the task of addressing the MediaOrderConflictWarning.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
