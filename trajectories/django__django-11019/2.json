The `Media.merge` method is critical as it handles the merging of lists and checks for order conflicts, emitting warnings if conflicts are detected. The `__add__` method is also relevant as it combines media objects. The `media_property` function is involved in defining how media is managed within widget classes, which is directly related to the widgets used in the form definition mentioned in the issue. The `MultiWidget._get_media` method, which aggregates media from multiple widgets, is another key element, as it demonstrates how media from different form components are combined.

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
