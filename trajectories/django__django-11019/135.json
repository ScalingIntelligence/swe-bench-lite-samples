            "scratch_pad": "First, I analyzed the reported issue which involves MediaOrderConflictWarnings when merging multiple media objects in Django forms. The issue is about ensuring that the JS files are correctly ordered in the media attribute of the form widgets. I then reviewed the search results to find relevant code spans that deal with media handling and form widgets. Two files were found: django/contrib/admin/options.py and django/contrib/admin/widgets.py. In options.py, there are various ModelAdmin methods related to handling form views, including _changeform_view, which might involve media handling during form initialization. In widgets.py, the RelatedFieldWidgetWrapper class and its methods deal with widget handling, potentially involving media initialization as well. Given the issue, it's important to inspect areas where media properties could be set or manipulated to ensure proper order. Based on the issue and the context provided, the identified spans are those from ModelAdmin class since it directly interacts with forms and their media handling. This includes the _changeform_view method, which is likely to be relevant as it initializes forms and handles the media. The relevant code spans from django/contrib/admin/options.py include everything from the ModelAdmin class up to and including the _changeform_view method, as they are directly related to form handling and media management, which are critical aspects of the reported issue. The evidence supporting this decision includes the alignment of these methods with the forms and media objects management, which are central to the problem.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
