Specifically, the issue is with the order in which JS files ('color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js') are being merged and the incorrect warning message being generated. Upon analyzing the search results, several code spans are found to be relevant to addressing this issue.\n\nThe 'MediaOrderConflictWarning' class definition is relevant as it defines the warning type generated.\n\nThe 'Media' class, particularly its '__init__' and '__add__' methods, are central to the merging and addition of media objects, which are likely places where the warning is triggered.\n\nThe 'Media.merge' method seems to handle the merging of lists of media files and generates the warning, making it a key part of the problem.\n\nThe 'media_property' and 'MediaDefiningClass' spans are also relevant as they pertain to how media properties are defined and how classes are created with media properties, respectively. These could hint at broader configurations that might influence the order of media file merging.\n\nGiven these key parts of the code, it appears that the identified spans cover the essential functionality related to the reported issue, ensuring a comprehensive engagement with the problem.",

  "initial_message": "Merging 3 or more media objects can throw unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following form definition, where text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js but all other JS files are independent:\nfrom django import forms\nclass ColorPicker(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['color-picker.js']\nclass SimpleTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js']\nclass FancyTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']\nclass MyForm(forms.Form):\n\tbackground_color = forms.CharField(widget=ColorPicker())\n\tintro = forms.CharField(widget=SimpleTextWidget())\n\tbody = forms.CharField(widget=FancyTextWidget())\nDjango should be able to resolve the JS files for the final form into the order text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js. However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
