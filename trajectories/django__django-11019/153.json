The problem leads to MediaOrderConflictWarnings due to incorrect ordering of JavaScript files when merging media from different widgets. The relevant files and classes that need investigation are 'django/forms/widgets.py' and its 'Media' class, as well as potential related methods such as '__add__', 'merge', and others within the 'Media' definition. Additionally, other form-related files such as 'django/forms/forms.py' and 'django/contrib/admin/widgets.py' should be checked for any oversight in the handling of media objects.",
