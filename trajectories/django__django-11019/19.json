This seems to be primarily related to the `widgets.py` and the `Media` class within it, which handles the merging and ordering of media files. The `forms.py` and `options.py` are also potentially relevant as they handle form and admin functionalities, respectively. Searching for the exact `__add__` method in the `Media` class and the `merge` method could be crucial to understanding and resolving the issue.",

This issue is related to the order in which media files are resolved and merged, particularly in the context of form widgets. From the search results, the relevant code spans are found in two files: 'django/forms/forms.py' and 'django/contrib/admin/options.py'. In 'django/forms/forms.py', the 'BaseForm.media' property is critical as it calculates the media for the form by aggregating the media from its fields. This is where the order of media files could potentially conflict, leading to the warning. The 'BaseForm' also contains other methods related to form management and media handling which could be relevant. In 'django/contrib/admin/options.py', the 'InlineModelAdmin.media' property is also relevant as it defines the media for inline model admins, which could interact with form media in a way that triggers the conflict. These two code spans are directly related to the media handling in forms and inlines, which are central to the issue reported. Therefore, these are the relevant code spans identified based on the reported issue.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
