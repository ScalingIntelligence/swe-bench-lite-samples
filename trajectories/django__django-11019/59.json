The warning is due to the order of merging, which incorrectly imposes constraints on the order of JavaScript files. The relevant files to investigate would primarily be those related to form widgets and media handling, such as `django/forms/widgets.py` and possibly `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py`. The focus should be on the `Media` class and its associated methods, particularly `merge` and `__add__`, which handle the merging of media lists. Additionally, examining the `Widget` classes and their media definitions might provide insight into how media dependencies are managed.",

Therefore, a more comprehensive search is needed, focusing less on specific widget implementations (like admin widgets) and more on core form handling and media merging functions. The search should now look for any place in the Django forms module where media objects are merged, possibly including related modules like `django.forms.forms` and `django.forms.widgets`.

Therefore, a new approach could be to search for any logging or warning generation related to media objects and order conflicts.
