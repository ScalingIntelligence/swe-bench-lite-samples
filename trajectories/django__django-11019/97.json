This issue seems to be related to how the Media class handles merging and ordering of JS files. The provided code snippets suggest that the widgets.py file is likely where the core logic for handling media objects resides, given the presence of the Media class and its merge method. Additionally, since the issue involves form widgets, it's reasonable to focus on this file specifically for relevant code. It's also worth checking related files like the admin/widgets.py for any overlapping functionalities or similar logic that could be contributing to this issue.",

The key elements to consider are the Media class and its methods for combining media objects, specifically focusing on how the order of JavaScript files is managed.\n\nIn the provided search results, there are several relevant code spans that could be involved in resolving this issue:\n1. In `django/forms/forms.py`, the `BaseForm.media` property is found, which iterates over the fields and combines their media. This is a crucial part as it is where the media for the form is collated.\n2. Also in `django/forms/forms.py`, the `DeclarativeFieldsMetaclass.__new__` method is relevant as it handles the creation of the form class, which includes initialization of fields.\n3. In `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, the `ModelAdmin.media` property defines the media for the admin, which could also be a part of the context where media-related issues occur.\n4. Additionally, `django/forms/formsets.py` contains the `BaseFormSet.media` property, which is also related to handling media for formsets, which might interact with forms media in complex ways.\n\nGiven the context of the reported issue, these code spans are identified as relevant because they directly or indirectly influence how media (especially JavaScript files) are ordered and combined within the Django form and admin contexts. Further analysis and potentially modifications in these areas could help resolve the MediaOrderConflictWarnings.",

To address this, we need to ensure that media objects are combined in a way that respects their dependencies more accurately, specifically by not imposing wrong order constraints derived from intermediate combinations.\n\nMy plan is to modify the `BaseForm.media` property to ensure that we avoid intermediate constraints that lead to these warnings.
