This indicates a problem in the way media objects are merged or ordered during the merging process. The relevant files to investigate are those related to form widgets and media handling, specifically in widgets.py, contrib/admin/widgets.py, and forms/forms.py. The goal is to locate the code responsible for merging media objects and the logic that determines their order. The focus should be on the Media class, Widget class, and their subclasses, as well as the merge function if it exists. Additionally, the __add__ method in the Media class might be relevant for overloading the addition of media objects.",

The search results reveal several key areas of interest within the Django codebase:\n\n1. **MediaOrderConflictWarning**: This is the custom warning class defined to handle the specific order conflict warnings. This class is defined in the `django/forms/widgets.py` file, represented by the span id 'MediaOrderConflictWarning'.\n\n2. **Media Class**: This class is responsible for managing media assets (CSS and JS files) within Django forms. Critical methods and properties within this class such as `__init__`, `__add__`, `merge`, and `render` are identified in the `django/forms/widgets.py` file. These methods handle the addition, merging, and rendering of media assets, which are central to the issue.\n\n3. **Media Property in BaseForm**: The `media` property within the `BaseForm` class in `django/forms/forms.py` is identified. This property is responsible for collecting and combining media assets from all fields in a form, which is directly related to the merging functionality under scrutiny.\n\n4. **MultiWidget and its Media Handling**: The `MultiWidget` class and its method `_get_media` in `django/forms/widgets.py` are identified. This class and method are responsible for handling media assets in the context of multiple widgets, which could be a scenario where the order conflict issue arises.\n\nFrom the analysis, the relevant code spans are primarily located in `django/forms/widgets.py` and `django/forms/forms.py`, where the Media class and Media handling within forms are defined. These locations include the specific methods and properties that could be contributing to or can be modified to address the MediaOrderConflictWarning issue.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
