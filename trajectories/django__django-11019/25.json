The main concern is that the merging logic for media files in the widgets.py file might not be handling the order constraints correctly, leading to warnings about conflicting media file orders. To address this, we should focus on the Media class and its merge method in widgets.py, as well as other related classes that involve media file handling such as Widget and MultiWidget. Additionally, it would be prudent to also check the forms.py file for any form-specific media handling, although the primary issue seems centered around the widgets media merging logic.",

The current file context and search results provide key insights into the code that manages media objects and their merging. The `Media` class in `django/forms/widgets.py` is particularly relevant, as it contains methods for merging media lists and handling conflicts. The `merge` method is directly related to the reported issue, as it identifies and warns about conflicting media order. The `__add__` method also plays a crucial role in merging media objects. Additionally, the `media_property` function in the same file indicates how media is managed at the class level. The `BaseForm.media` property in `django/forms/forms.py` shows how media is aggregated for form fields, which is also relevant to understanding the issue. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of how media is handled and merged, including the mechanisms that might lead to the MediaOrderConflictWarning. Identifying these spans helps in understanding and potentially addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Merging 3 or more media objects can throw unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following form definition, where text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js but all other JS files are independent:\nfrom django import forms\nclass ColorPicker(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['color-picker.js']\nclass SimpleTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js']\nclass FancyTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']\nclass MyForm(forms.Form):\n\tbackground_color = forms.CharField(widget=ColorPicker())\n\tintro = forms.CharField(widget=SimpleTextWidget())\n\tbody = forms.CharField(widget=FancyTextWidget())\nDjango should be able to resolve the JS files for the final form into the order text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js. However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
