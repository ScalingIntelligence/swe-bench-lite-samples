The MediaOrderConflictWarning arises when merging media objects, indicating a conflict in the order of some JS files. To address this, we need to focus on the merging logic within the Media class and its related methods, as well as the classes that define media, like Widget and Form. We should also pay attention to any helper methods or classes that might be involved in the merging process. Given the context provided, I will start by searching for the Media class and its merge method, along with the Widget and Form classes which might make use of media merging functionalities.",

The warning is triggered due to the order of JS files during the merging process, which can lead to incorrect order resolutions and warnings that are misleading or incorrect. The key elements to focus on from the reported issue are the `Media` class, its methods for merging JS files (`__add__` and `merge`), and the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` itself. Given this, I will analyze the provided search results to identify if they contain the relevant code spans that deal with these elements directly.\n\nFrom the 'django/forms/widgets.py' file, the `Media` class and its related methods are the primary focus. The `MediaOrderConflictWarning` class is also present, indicating that the warnings are defined here. The `Media.__add__` method and the `Media.merge` method are crucial for understanding how media objects are merged and how the warning is generated. The `Media._js` property and the `Media.merge` method are especially relevant as they directly deal with the merging of JS lists, which is where the conflict occurs. This file essentially encapsulates the mechanisms at play for the reported issue.\n\nThe other files ('django/contrib/admin/widgets.py' and 'django/forms/forms.py') do not directly relate to the merging of media objects or the generation of warnings, but they provide context on how widgets and forms are structured in Django. 'django/utils/translation/trans_real.py' also does not directly relate to the issue at hand. Therefore, the focus remains on 'django/forms/widgets.py'.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans from 'django/forms/widgets.py' address the core of the reported issue, ensuring that all critical aspects are covered.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
