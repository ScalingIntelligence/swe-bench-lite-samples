The problem seems to be in how the media files are being merged and the order they are being processed. Focus should be on the `Media` class and its methods, especially `__add__`, `merge`, and `render`, as these are likely handling the merging logic. Additionally, the files `widgets.py` and `forms.py` are crucial since they contain the `Media` class and related form handling code. The search should aim to find specific functions and methods that handle media file merging and ordering.",

The search results contain several key code spans identified in the issue description, such as the Media class definition, the merge method within the Media class, and the __add__ method which handles the addition of media objects. These code spans are directly related to the merging and ordering of media files, which is central to the issue. Additionally, the MediaOrderConflictWarning class is also present in the search results, confirming that the codebase correctly defines this warning. Reviewing these code spans, it becomes clear that they are relevant to the reported issue as they deal with the exact problem of merging media files and handling their order, including the potential for warnings to be issued due to conflicts in order.

This change was based on the idea that the warning was being triggered unnecessarily due to the way the lists are combined. However, upon further review, it seems that removing the warning logic entirely may not be the best solution as it could mask real order conflicts in other scenarios where the order of media files actually matters. Instead, we should refine the merging logic to handle the specific issue reported in a more targeted way.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
