Specifically, functions like __add__ and merge in the Media class and the way media objects are defined in Widget subclasses are critical areas of focus.",

Specifically, the issue stems from the order in which JavaScript files are added to a form's media property. The provided search results contain code related to the BaseForm class in Django's forms module. Notably, the media property in the BaseForm class is a crucial part of the code where media objects from each field's widget are combined. This function directly addresses the concern of merging media objects and their potential order conflicts. The analysis of the media property method in the BaseForm class indicates that it iterates over the fields and accumulates their media properties. This behavior is highly relevant to the issue at hand, as incorrect ordering could lead to MediaOrderConflictWarnings. Based on the analysis and relevance, the media property method in the BaseForm class as a code span is identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

The issue provides a form definition where different widgets depend on certain JavaScript files, and it expects Django to resolve the order correctly. Next, I reviewed the current file context provided in the <file_context> tag, which included a BaseForm class with a media property that merges media from the form's fields. Then I processed new search results from <search_results> tag, where I found a Media class with methods handling CSS and JS file merging and an associated warning, MediaOrderConflictWarning. I found the merge method where the warning is triggered and the __add__ method which is related to merging media objects. I also examined MultiWidget class which has a separate method for handling media merging. Based on the analysis, I identified the Media class, including its merge method and __add__ method, as relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the MultiWidget's _get_media method and the BaseForm's media property are also relevant as they either directly handle media merging or call upon the Media class to do so. I have used these findings to present the relevant code spans.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
