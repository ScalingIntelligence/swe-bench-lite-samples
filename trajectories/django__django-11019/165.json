To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that are responsible for merging media objects and handling their order. The key elements to look for include the Media class, its merge method, and the associated warnings. Additionally, we should also examine the `__add__` method of the Media class to understand how media objects are combined. Furthermore, understanding how the widgets are rendered and how their media is combined in the context of a form is crucial. The relevant spans identified are those related to the Media class and its methods such as `__init__`, `__add__`, `merge`, `render_js`, and `render_css`. Furthermore, the section on `media_property` looks relevant as it likely handles the definition and rendering of media for widgets and forms.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
