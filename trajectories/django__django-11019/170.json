The warning seems to be incorrectly identifying the conflict based on the order of addition, leading to an unintuitive final result. The initial context provided suggests that the issue likely resides within the Media class or the Widget class in django/forms/widgets.py, as these are central to defining and merging media files in Django forms. Additionally, the AdminTimeWidget media class in django/contrib/admin/widgets.py might be relevant if it uses or affects the merging logic. Thus, focusing on these specific areas for the search would be prudent.",

The warning occurs when there are conflicts in the order of media files, particularly when merging JS files. The reported issue notes that merging ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media wrongly imposes a constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js. The Media class in django/forms/widgets.py seems to be responsible for handling media objects, including merging JS and CSS files. The method `Media.merge` is likely where the conflict detection occurs. This method merges lists of media files and checks for order conflicts. The `Media.__add__` method is also relevant as it combines media objects. Additionally, the `media_property` function appears to be responsible for defining the media property for widgets. The AdminTimeWidget class in django/contrib/admin/widgets.py is not directly relevant to the issue but provides context on how media is handled in widgets within the admin interface.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
