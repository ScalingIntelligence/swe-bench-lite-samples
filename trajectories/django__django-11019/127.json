This class is responsible for handling the merging of media files, which includes CSS and JavaScript files. The key problematic section is the Media.merge method, specifically the part where it checks for duplicates and potentially raises a MediaOrderConflictWarning. Given the issue description, it's clear that this warning is incorrectly triggered due to the order of media files being merged. The provided search results include extensive code spans from django/forms/widgets.py, which encompasses the Media class, its methods, and the MediaOrderConflictWarning definition. Notably, the code spans for Media.__init__, Media.merge, and the definition of MediaOrderConflictWarning are relevant as they directly pertain to the media merging functionality and warning system. Additionally, the overall structure of the Media class and how it handles merging needs to be carefully assessed to identify potential solutions or modifications to avoid unnecessary warnings while preserving the desired functionality of ensuring proper media file order.",
