The specific files of interest are likely in the forms and widgets modules, where the Media class and related merging logic are defined. We need to specifically look for the `__add__` method in the Media class and the `merge` static method, as these are likely places where the merging logic resides. Additionally, checking the Widget and MediaDefiningClass classes might provide more context or methods related to media handling.",

The issue specifically mentions that the order of JS files should be resolved but the current implementation results in a warning and an incorrect order. The search results contain several relevant code spans in the `django/forms/widgets.py` file, which is a primary location for handling Media objects in Django forms. The identified spans include the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` class, the `Media` class, and its associated methods such as `__init__`, `__repr__`, `render`, `merge`, and `__add__`. These spans are directly related to managing the media properties of form widgets and merging media objects, which is crucial for resolving the reported issue. Additionally, the `media_property` and `MediaDefiningClass` spans are relevant as they are responsible for defining and managing media properties at the class level. The other files, `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py` and `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, contain unrelated code spans mostly dealing with admin widgets and their media properties, which are not directly relevant to the reported issue.",
