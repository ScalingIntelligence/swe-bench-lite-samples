The problem occurs when merging media objects from different widgets used in the form. This results in a MediaOrderConflictWarning when the order of JavaScript files is different from what is expected. To address this, we should focus on the Media class and its related methods in the django/forms/widgets.py file, as this is where media merging logic is likely to reside. Additionally, the Form class in django/forms/forms.py and Widget classes in django/forms/widgets.py are also critical as they define the media files for each widget. We should also look at how media is being defined and merged, specifically the __add__ method in the Media class and any related merging functions. By concentrating on these parts, we can identify the root cause of the MediaOrderConflictWarning and understand how to resolve it.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
