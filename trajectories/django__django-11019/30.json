This warning suggests that there is an improper order of media files when they are combined, despite the dependencies between them.\n\nThe relevant part of the codebase to focus on is the `Media` class in `django/forms/widgets.py`, especially the methods responsible for merging and handling media files such as `__init__`, `merge`, `__add__`, and the properties `_js` and `_css`. These methods are crucial for understanding how the JS files are combined and how the order might be causing the conflict. Additionally, the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` class is relevant, as it defines the warning that is raised in these cases.\n\nFrom the search results, the key spans to focus on are those related to the `Media` class (e.g., `Media.__init__`, `Media.merge`, `Media.__add__`) and the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` span. These spans contain the logic responsible for combining media files and raising warnings when conflicts are detected.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue because they directly involve the code that handles the merging of media files and the detection of order conflicts.",
