The key elements to focus on are the classes and methods that deal with media merging and ordering - particularly those related to Media and its merging process.\n\nThe search results provide several relevant pieces of code. The Media class and its methods, especially the merge function where the warning is issued, are directly relevant. The process of merging media files in `Media.merge` and the addition of media in `Media.__add__` are crucial for understanding the order conflicts.\n\nAdditionally, the `media_property` function and the MultiWidget class in `django/forms/widgets.py` show how media properties are defined and how widgets interact with media, offering deeper context into where and how media files might be loaded inappropriately.\n\nFrom `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py`, the AdminDateWidget and AdminTimeWidget are less directly relevant but provide context on how media is managed in widgets, which could hint at broader patterns in the codebase affecting the issue.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
