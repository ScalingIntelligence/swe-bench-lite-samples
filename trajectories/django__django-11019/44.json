The code spans provided in the search results need to be carefully reviewed to align with this issue. The initial spans include definitions of the MediaOrderConflictWarning and the Media class. Specifically relevant to the issue are the spans for the Media class's initialization (__init__ method), the merge method, and the addition (__add__) method. The __init__ method is responsible for the construction of the Media object, and the __add__ method is used for merging media objects. The merge method, however, is responsible for combining lists of media files and generating warnings if conflicts (specifically file order conflicts) are detected. This method is directly addressing the concern in the reported issue. Therefore, these code spans (MediaOrderConflictWarning, Media.__init__, Media.merge, and Media.__add__) are relevant to the issue of unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings when merging media objects. The analysis of these methods indicates that they are directly involved in managing the merging of media objects and could be sources of the conflict warning reported.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
