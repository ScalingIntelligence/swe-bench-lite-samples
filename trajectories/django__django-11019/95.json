This warning arises due to the order in which media files are added and the constraints they impose on the order of appearance. The relevant files to investigate would include those where media objects are defined and merged. Specifically, the Media class in 'django/forms/widgets.py' and related classes in 'django/contrib/admin/widgets.py' and 'django/forms/forms.py' are likely places to start. Additionally, any class that deals with media merging and order constraints should be examined. The search should focus on lines with specific logic for merging media lists and dealing with their order to identify potential misalignments or inconsistencies that lead to the warning.",

The primary focus is on the correct ordering of JavaScript files within the Media class and the handling of such conflicts. The search results provide several code spans that are highly relevant to the issue. Specifically, the MediaOrderConflictWarning class and the Media class's merge method from django/forms/widgets.py are crucial as they directly address the conflict warning and the merging logic of media files. Additionally, the BaseForm class in django/forms/forms.py contributes context on how media is aggregated for forms, which indirectly affects the issue. The AdminDateWidget and AdminTimeWidget classes from django/contrib/admin/widgets.py, though not directly related to the conflict warning, are pertinent to understanding how media is managed in different form widgets. This analysis leads to the identification of specific code spans that are most relevant to the issue at hand.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
