'MediaOrderConflictWarning' defines the warning class used when a conflict is detected. This is directly related to the issue.\n\n2. 'Media' class and its methods such as '__init__' and '__add__' are responsible for initializing and combining media objects. These are crucial for understanding how media objects are managed.\n\n3. 'Media.merge' is a static method that merges two lists of media files, generating a warning if an order conflict is detected. This method is central to the reported issue.\n\n4. In 'BaseForm', the 'media' property combines media from form fields. Although less directly related to the warning, understanding how media is aggregated from fields can provide context.\n\nFrom these spans, I can focus on the aspects that directly relate to the warning generation and media merging to understand the root cause of the issue.",

Specifically, the Media class in django/forms/widgets.py contains methods (like __add__, merge, and __getitem__) that handle media merging and order. The issue's concern about MediaOrderConflictWarnings is directly related to these methods. Additionally, the BaseForm class in django/forms/forms.py also has a media property that combines media from all form fields. The issue mentioned involves the merging logic of media objects, which aligns with the code provided in these files. Therefore, the file context seems sufficient to address the reported issue as it covers the core parts of the codebase responsible for handling media merging and order.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
