The warning 'MediaOrderConflictWarning' indicates that there might be an issue with the order in which these files are being merged. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that the solution involves checking and possibly modifying the methods responsible for merging media lists in the 'django/forms/widgets.py' file. Additionally, since the issue involves form widgets and media definitions, it's also important to check the 'django/contrib/admin/widgets.py' and 'django/forms/forms.py' files for any related logic.",

The search results provide key sections of code that are relevant to the issue. The MediaOrderConflictWarning class and the Media class, especially the merge and __add__ methods, are directly related to handling and merging media files. These methods are responsible for combining lists of media files while checking for order conflicts. The context provided in the issue indicates that the order of concatenation of media objects can lead to warnings about conflicting orders, which seems to be the core problem here. The Media.__init__, Media.merge, and Media.__add__ methods are indeed the focus since they deal with the creation and merging of media objects. Additionally, the BaseForm.media method is relevant as it contributes to the composition of the media files for a form. This method shows how media objects are aggregated from individual fields, which is also crucial in understanding the context of media handling in Django forms. The other parts of the search results, such as AdminDateWidget and BaseForm's various methods, while related to forms and widgets, do not directly address the issue of media file merging and conflicting orders. Therefore, they are not as pertinent to this specific issue. The identified sections of code provide a comprehensive view of how media files are managed in Django forms, particularly focusing on the handling and potential conflicts in their ordering. These code spans are sufficient to understand and address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Merging 3 or more media objects can throw unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following form definition, where text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js but all other JS files are independent:\nfrom django import forms\nclass ColorPicker(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['color-picker.js']\nclass SimpleTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js']\nclass FancyTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']\nclass MyForm(forms.Form):\n\tbackground_color = forms.CharField(widget=ColorPicker())\n\tintro = forms.CharField(widget=SimpleTextWidget())\n\tbody = forms.CharField(widget=FancyTextWidget())\nDjango should be able to resolve the JS files for the final form into the order text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js. However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
