Specifically, the issue involves the MediaOrderConflictWarning being triggered when merging 3 or more media objects, which leads to an unexpected and user-confusing outcome. To address this, it's essential to focus on the Media class and its associated methods, particularly those responsible for merging media lists and detecting order conflicts. The search results have provided key insights into the relevant bits of code. The MediaOrderConflictWarning class defines the warning itself, while the Media class and its methods (__init__, absolute_path, merge, and __add__) are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the merging logic. The merge method, in particular, is where the order conflict is detected and the warning is issued. Reviewing and understanding this method will be vital to addressing the reported issue. Other methods like __init__ and __add__ also play a role in setting up and combining media objects, which is contextually important. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of how media merging is implemented and where the issue arises, laying a solid foundation for further investigation and potential fixes.",

  "initial_message": "Merging 3 or more media objects can throw unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following form definition, where text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js but all other JS files are independent:\nfrom django import forms\nclass ColorPicker(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['color-picker.js']\nclass SimpleTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js']\nclass FancyTextWidget(forms.Widget):\n\tclass Media:\n\t\tjs = ['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']\nclass MyForm(forms.Form):\n\tbackground_color = forms.CharField(widget=ColorPicker())\n\tintro = forms.CharField(widget=SimpleTextWidget())\n\tbody = forms.CharField(widget=FancyTextWidget())\nDjango should be able to resolve the JS files for the final form into the order text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js. However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
