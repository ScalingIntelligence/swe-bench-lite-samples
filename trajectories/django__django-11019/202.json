From the search results, the key sections to focus on are the MediaOrderConflictWarning class definition, the Media class, and its methods including __init__, merge, and __add__. These parts of the code handle media object management and merging, which are critical for understanding and resolving the reported issue. Additionally, the BaseForm and Form sections from django/forms/forms.py can be relevant as they involve form media handling. The AdminDateWidget and AdminTimeWidget sections from django/contrib/admin/widgets.py, while not directly related to the issue at hand, show how media files are defined and used in different widgets, which could be useful context for understanding media merging issues in a broader sense.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
