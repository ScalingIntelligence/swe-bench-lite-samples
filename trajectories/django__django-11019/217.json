The warning occurs due to the incorrect order of JS files when merging.

Specifically, we should focus on the Media class's merge method and the __add__ method, which could be where the merging logic goes wrong. Additionally, examining how media is defined and merged in form and widget classes like ColorPicker, SimpleTextWidget, and FancyTextWidget, and in the MyForm class could provide further clues.",

The key focus is on understanding the logic that handles the merging and ordering of these media files to identify where conflicts arise. The search results provide critical information about the Media class, its methods for handling CSS and JS files, and the merge function that likely triggers the MediaOrderConflictWarning. Additionally, the context around how media properties are defined and merged in widgets like MultiWidget is also relevant. The code spans related to MediaOrderConflictWarning, Media class, and the merge function specifically seem directly pertinent to addressing the problem. By analyzing these spans, it becomes clear that the core logic responsible for merging media lists and potentially triggering warnings resides within the Media class and its associated methods.

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
