The main concern is the MediaOrderConflictWarning which arises due to the order of merging media files that have dependencies. The core functionality for handling media in Django forms resides in the `django.forms.widgets` module, specifically within the `Media` class and its related methods like `__add__` and `merge`. Additionally, the `MediaDefiningClass` metaclass and the `Widget` class could be relevant as they define how media properties are inherited and manipulated. Since no files have been identified yet, starting a search with a focus on these classes and methods within the `django.forms.widgets` module is a logical first step.",

However, accessing MyForm().media results in:\n/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\ntext-editor-extras.js\ntext-editor.js\n MediaOrderConflictWarning,\nMedia(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])\nThe MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.\nThe final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the \"na\u00efve\" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)\n"
