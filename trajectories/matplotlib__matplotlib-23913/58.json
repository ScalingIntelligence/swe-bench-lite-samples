From the provided context, it's evident that the Legend class and its related functionalities are spread across multiple files, including 'lib/matplotlib/legend.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py'. The search should focus on the Legend class's __init__ method in 'lib/matplotlib/legend.py' to determine if the 'draggable' keyword can be added as a parameter for instantiation. Additionally, since the keyword 'draggable' is already available in the set_draggable method, it would be beneficial to understand the current implementation and check for any potential reasons why it isn't a part of the __init__ method. This will help in exploring the feasibility of the proposed feature request.",

The search results provide a `DraggableLegend` class, which seems pertinent, as well as the `Legend` class with its `__init__` method. Within the `__init__` method of the `Legend` class, currently, there are no parameters directly associated with draggability, indicating that adding such a parameter could serve the user's request. The `set_draggable` method of the `Legend` class, however, suggests how to set the draggability of a legend after its creation, which could guide how to integrate draggability directly into the constructor. While the current implementation does not directly support the feature being requested, the existing design provides a basis for adding the new functionality. Given the issue's nature, concentrating on the `Legend` class and its `__init__` method to introduce a 'draggable' parameter appears most relevant. It is advisable to prevent modifications to the method signature during an implementation, esp. concerning backward compatibility. The provided search results adequately cover the necessary elements to progress on this, considering specifics of the `Legend` class, its constructor, and the existance of a `DraggableLegend` class that handles this behavior.",
