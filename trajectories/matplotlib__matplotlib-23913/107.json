The search results provided include the `Legend` class with its `__init__` method, which does not currently accept a 'draggable' parameter. Additionally, there is a `set_draggable` method within the `Legend` class that sets the legend as draggable after creation. A related class, `DraggableLegend`, is also found. Based on the reported issue, the relevant code spans are the `Legend` class's `__init__` method and the `DraggableLegend` class, as they involve the Legend's creation and its draggable functionality. The `Legend.set_draggable` method is also relevant but not directly addressed by the reported issue, which seeks to integrate draggable functionality at legend creation time. Therefore, it's suggested to add a 'draggable' parameter to the `Legend.__init__` method and use this parameter to automatically initialize the DraggableLegend instance if set to True. This would involve updating the `Legend.__init__` method to initialize the DraggableLegend under the condition that 'draggable=True' is passed. However, given the current search results, such a change is not yet implemented.",
