This would simplify the process compared to making it draggable after creation with set_draggable. Analyzing the provided code, we can see the relevant class definitions for Legend and DraggableLegend. The __init__ method of Legend currently does not include any parameter for draggability. The set_draggable method is used for enabling draggability post-creation, suggesting that modifying the __init__ method to accept a 'draggable' parameter and initializing the draggability appropriately would address the issue. Given these insights, the relevant sections of the code are those where the Legend class is defined, particularly the __init__ method, and potentially the DraggableLegend class which is used in set_draggable. Therefore, the identified spans are 'Legend.__init__' where the new keyword could be added and 'Legend.set_draggable' which informs how the draggable state is handled.",
