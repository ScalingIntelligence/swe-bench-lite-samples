This would allow the legend to be draggable upon creation instead of needing to call set_draggable() separately. Reviewing the code, it's clear that the DraggableLegend class already exists and is used by the Legend class's set_draggable() method. However, the Legend class's __init__ method does not currently accept a 'draggable' parameter. To address the issue, one would need to modify the Legend class's __init__ method to accept the 'draggable' parameter and integrate it with the DraggableLegend class as needed. The relevant code spans are the Legend class definition, specifically its __init__ method, and the set_draggable method. Additionally, the existence of the DraggableLegend class is relevant because it would likely need modifications or integration to fully support the 'draggable' keyword at initialization time.\n\nIt's important to note that while the current context suggests modifying the existing Legend class and potentially the DraggableLegend class (or integrating them more closely), it's not a trivial addition due to potential complications, such as ensuring that all necessary setup for draggable functionality is performed during the Legend object's initialization. Additionally, careful consideration must be given to any existing uses of these classes to avoid breaking changes in the API or unexpected behavior. Therefore, any modification should be preceded by thorough testing and consideration of backward compatibility.",

Additionally, the class DraggableLegend is present, which could potentially be adapted for including 'draggable' functionality at Legend object creation. The context does not explicitly contain the code or method to initialize 'draggable' during the Legend's creation; however, it hints at a possible integration based on the DraggableLegend class's behavior. For completeness in addressing the issue, it is suggested to identify similar patterns used in other parts of the library and potentially in 'figure.py', as FigureBase also manages legend creation. This multi-file view provides a robust starting point, but further inspection across related files and a deeper integration strategy are critical for a fully comprehensive solution.",
