I analyzed the Legend class in the search results and found that there are already methods for making the legend draggable, specifically the set_draggable method in the Legend class. There is a DraggableLegend class that handles the draggable behavior, and the __init__ method of the Legend class already supports setting draggable properties though not directly at initialization. Therefore, the solution to enable the 'draggable' keyword at initialization would be to add the keyword to the __init__ method of the Legend class and initialize the DraggableLegend class if the keyword is set to True. Based on the current context and search results, the relevant code spans are located in the 'lib/matplotlib/legend.py' file, as they are directly related to managing legend behavior and the existing draggable functionality.",
