The current implementation requires the legend to be created and then made draggable. The <search_results> provide insights into the existing code structure related to the Legend and DraggableLegend classes in 'lib/matplotlib/legend.py'. Key functions include __init__ for defining the Legend object, set_draggable for making the legend draggable post-creation, and the DraggableLegend class for handling the draggable functionality. It is evident that adding a 'draggable' parameter to the Legend constructor could integrate draggable functionality directly during legend creation. The current context is empty signaling the need for identifying initial relevant code. From the provided search results, code spans related to the Legend and DraggableLegend classes, particularly their __init__ methods, align closely with the request to include draggable functionality at legend creation. These sections are likely the starting point for addressing the issue. Therefore, the relevant spans include those defining the Legend's __init__ method, the DraggableLegend's __init__ and related methods, and the existing set_draggable method in the Legend class as they are critical for understanding the current implementation and for potential modifications to support the new feature.",
