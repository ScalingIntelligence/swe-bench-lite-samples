The 'DraggableLegend' class in the search results is a subclass of 'DraggableOffsetBox', which is used to make the legend draggable after creation. The issue suggests adding the 'draggable' keyword directly to the Legend's __init__ method.\n2. The 'Legend' class and its __init__ method are properly identified.\n3. There is a 'set_draggable' method in the Legend class which allows making the legend draggable post-creation.\n\nGiven the information, the most relevant code spans involve the 'Legend' class definition and the 'set_draggable' method, as these are directly involved in the creation and modification of the legend's draggable state. To resolve the reported issue, we would need to understand why 'draggable' is not a keyword argument in the __init__ method and whether it can be added without breaking existing functionality. It might involve modifying the __init__ method to accept an additional 'draggable' keyword argument and setting this up to work in conjunction with the existing 'set_draggable' method. However, the search results do not provide a definitive answer for why 'draggable' is not currently an argument in __init__. Therefore, a deeper review, possibly involving code that initially defined these limitations, would be necessary for a full understanding and resolution.",
