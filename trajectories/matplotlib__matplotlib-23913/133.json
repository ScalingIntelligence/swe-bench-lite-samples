Since the Legend class already has a 'set_draggable' method, it suggests that the functionality to make the legend draggable exists but is not available directly during initialization. To confirm this, we should look specifically at the Legend class's __init__ method and the set_draggable method to understand their implementations and determine if integrating 'draggable=True' directly into the __init__ function is feasible. Additionally, it's worth checking if there are any specific constraints or object dependencies that would prevent this feature from being added to the constructor.",
