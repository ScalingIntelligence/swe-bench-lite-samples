Reviewing the current file context, the Legend class already supports making the legend draggable but requires an additional call to set_draggable after creation. The search results confirm the existence of a DraggableLegend class and the set_draggable method in the Legend class, but the Legend's __init__ method does not currently include a 'draggable' parameter. To address the issue, it is necessary to add the 'draggable' parameter to the Legend's __init__ method to potentially initialize a DraggableLegend instance directly upon Legend creation if the 'draggable' parameter is set to True. This would allow for the desired functionality described in the issue. The relevant code spans are identified in the search results, particularly the DraggableLegend class and its methods for updating the legend's location and anchor box, and the set_draggable method in the Legend class. These are essential components for enabling a legend to be draggable.",

This would be more handy than having to call it after legend creation.  And, naively, it would seem simple to do.  But maybe there is a reason why it would not work?\n"
