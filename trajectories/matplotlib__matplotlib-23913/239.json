This would allow legends to be made draggable at creation time, rather than having to call a method after the legend is created. Reviewing the provided code, it appears that the Legend class and its __init__ method are already quite comprehensive in terms of handling various initialization parameters. Adding a 'draggable' parameter to this __init__ method would involve modifying the signature of the __init__ method to include this new parameter and then implementing the logic to set the draggable property of the legend instance accordingly. The rest of the initialization logic should allow for this addition without significant modifications. Based on the search results, the __init__ method of the Legend class is the most relevant part of the code to address the feature request. It is also worth noting that the class documentation for the Legend class is missing from the provided search results, but it would be beneficial to also include this in any updates to ensure the new 'draggable' feature is properly documented.",
