To assess the relevance of the search results, I focused on the Legend class and its associated methods. The Legend class does not currently include a 'draggable' parameter in its __init__ method, which aligns with the feature request. However, there is a DraggableLegend class and a set_draggable method associated with the Legend class. The set_draggable method is used to make the legend draggable after its creation, which supports the idea of integrating this functionality directly into the Legend class's initialization for user convenience. The current setup indicates a clear starting point or reference for how draggable functionality is implemented and managed, which is valuable for considering additions to the Legend class's __init__ method. Based on this, I identified the relevant code spans that could guide the implementation of the requested feature.",
