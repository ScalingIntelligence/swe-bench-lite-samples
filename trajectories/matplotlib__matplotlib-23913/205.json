This would allow making the legend draggable at the time of creation, eliminating the need to call it separately after legend creation. The current file context includes the Legend class definition, its __init__ method, and a related method set_draggable. The new search results include a DraggableLegend class, which is currently used in the set_draggable method to make the legend draggable after creation. To address the user's request, it would be necessary to add the 'draggable' keyword to the __init__ method of the Legend class, and potentially integrate the functionality of the DraggableLegend class into the Legend class. It's important to note that the current Legend class does not include the 'draggable' keyword in its __init__ method, but it does have a set_draggable method that uses the DraggableLegend class. This implies that the functionality for making the legend draggable is partially in place, but it lacks the immediate activation at creation that the user desires.",
