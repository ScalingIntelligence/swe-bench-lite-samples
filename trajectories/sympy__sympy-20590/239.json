In version 1.6.2, `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute, but in version 1.7, they do, which is unexpected given the use of `__slots__` to optimize memory usage. The search results provide several code spans from `sympy/core/symbol.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` that define the `Symbol` class and its inheritance hierarchy. Notably, the `Symbol` class in `sympy/core/symbol.py` defines `__slots__` with the attribute `name`, which should prevent the creation of a `__dict__`. However, the presence of `__dict__` in version 1.7 suggests a conflict or a change in the inheritance hierarchy that is not captured in these snippets. It is crucial to inspect the initialization and inheritance in more detail to understand the addition of `__dict__`. Additionally, reviewing how the `Expr` class, which `Symbol` inherits from, handles `__slots__` and `__dict__` is important.",

This aligns with the behavior observed in version 1.6.2 where `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__`. However, the issue states that in version 1.7, `Symbol` instances have a `__dict__`, suggesting a change in behavior. This change might be due to alterations in the class hierarchy or initialization methods, which are not fully covered in the provided context. The 'expr.py' file defines the `Expr` class, which `Symbol` inherits from, but it also uses `__slots__ = ()`, indicating no additional attributes beyond `name` for `Symbol`. Given the limited context and the absence of detailed changes between versions, it's not possible to definitively identify the cause of the change in `__dict__` behavior for `Symbol` instances in version 1.7.",

In version 1.6.2, `Symbol` instances did not have `__dict__` and had `__slots__` defined with a single slot for 'name'. In version 1.7, `Symbol` instances now have `__dict__`, which is expected to be an empty dictionary. Given the purpose of `__slots__`, this change is assumed to be a bug. The relevant code spans to investigate further are those where `Symbol` class is defined or its `__slots__` attribute is mentioned or modified. The provided context provides a definition of the `Symbol` class with `__slots__` and its `__new__` method. The search results provide the same definition of `Symbol` class and its `__slots__` attribute, along with related methods and class ancestors. The definition of `Dummy` and `Wild` classes, which are subclasses of `Symbol`, are also provided, showing them potentially inheriting the behavior of `Symbol` or modifying it. The existence of `__dict__` in `Expr` class with `__slots__` set to an empty tuple in the context of `expr.py` might offer insight or indicate inherited behavior for the `Symbol` class located in `symbol.py`. The investigation should focus on potential inheritance implications and class structure to understand why `__dict__` might be introduced upon instance creation or how `__slots__` are handled across class inheritance in the SymPy library.",
