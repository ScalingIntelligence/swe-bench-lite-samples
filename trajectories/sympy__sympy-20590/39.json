In 1.6.2, `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute, which is consistent with the use of `__slots__` (as evidenced by the presence of `__slots__` with 'name' in the 1.6.2 snippet). The introduction of `__dict__` in version 1.7 suggests a potential bug related to the handling of `__slots__` in a parent class. The focus should be on identifying the changes in the `Symbol` class or any of its parent classes.",

However, in version 1.7, the `__dict__` attribute exists and returns an empty dictionary. This change might be unintended and could be related to the removal or modification of `__slots__` in some parent class. The provided search results include the definition of the Symbol class, which still has `__slots__` defined with 'name', indicating that this change should not have occurred due to the Symbol class itself. Further investigation is needed to see if any parent class has affected this behavior. Relevant code spans include the definition of the Symbol class and the `__slots__` attribute.

The `Symbol` class clearly defines `__slots__` with 'name', which aligns with the behavior observed in version 1.6.2 where `__dict__` was not present. This indicates that the absence of `__dict__` in version 1.6.2 was intentional and correctly implemented. The introduction of `__dict__` in version 1.7 could be due to changes in the behavior of `__slots__` in the `AtomicExpr` or `Boolean` classes, which are parent classes of `Symbol`. Additionally, examining the `__new_stage2__` method and its caching mechanism (using `cacheit`) might also provide insights into this change.
