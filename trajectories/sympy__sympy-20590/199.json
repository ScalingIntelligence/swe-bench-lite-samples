In version 1.6.2, `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute, which was expected due to the presence of `__slots__`. However, in version 1.7, the `Symbol` instances now have a `__dict__`, which is considered a potential bug. The key elements to look for in the code are the definition and usage of the `__slots__` attribute in the `Symbol` class.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `Symbol` class definition within the `sympy/core/symbol.py` file. Specifically, the `Symbol` class has a `__slots__` attribute defined as `('name',)`. This directly addresses the issue by showing the intended use of `__slots__` to prevent the creation of a `__dict__`. The code spans identified are those that define the `Symbol` class and its `__slots__` attribute. Additionally, examining the entire section of the `Symbol` class is crucial to understand any changes that might have inadvertently allowed a `__dict__` to be created.\n\nBased on the analysis, the search task is complete as the relevant code spans have been identified that address the issue reported.",
