In version 1.6.2, Symbol instances lacked a `__dict__` attribute, but in version 1.7, they have one, which is unexpected given the presence of `__slots__`. This suggests a potential bug related to how `__slots__` is being handled in the inheritance hierarchy of the Symbol class. To investigate this, we need to focus on the implementation of the Symbol class and its parent classes to understand how `__slots__` is defined and inherited.",

In 1.6.2, `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute, but in 1.7, they do. The issue indicates that this might be a bug due to a parent class accidentally stopping defining `__slots__`. Analyzing the provided search results, the most relevant code spans are those within the `Symbol` class definition, especially where `__slots__` is defined. The `__slots__` attribute is specified as `('name',)`, which aligns with the context of the issue. Additionally, the `Symbol` class and its methods provide a comprehensive view of how `Symbol` instances are created and managed, which is crucial for understanding the behavior described in the issue. The `Dummy` class, a subclass of `Symbol`, further confirms the use of `__slots__` and highlights another important aspect of symbol management in SymPy. Since the primary concern is the presence of the `__dict__` attribute in `Symbol` instances in version 1.7, the identified code spans should provide sufficient context to investigate this issue further. Therefore, the search task appears to be complete with the files and code spans identified as relevant.",
