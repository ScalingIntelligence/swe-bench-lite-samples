In version 1.6.2, `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute, which aligns with the use of `__slots__`. However, in version 1.7, this attribute now exists, which might be unintended due to the purpose of `__slots__`. The focus should be on the `Symbol` class and any potential parent classes that might have inadvertently stopped defining `__slots__`. Additionally, the version-specific changes should be investigated to understand how the `Symbol` class was modified in version 1.7.",

In 1.6.2, `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute, but in 1.7, they do. The issue suggests that this might be a bug related to the `__slots__` attribute. The search results include code from `sympy/core/symbol.py` which is relevant because it directly involves the `Symbol` class. Specifically, the code spans that define the `Symbol` class and its `__slots__` attribute are most relevant. Additionally, the `Dummy` and `Wild` classes, which are subclasses of `Symbol`, are also included, though they might not be directly relevant to the reported issue.
