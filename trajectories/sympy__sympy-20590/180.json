In version 1.6.2, Symbol instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute, but in version 1.7, they do, which might indicate a bug related to the `__slots__` functionality. The code analysis revealed that the `Symbol` class indeed uses `__slots__` to only include the 'name' attribute, which aligns with preventing the creation of a `__dict__` attribute. However, the search results do not provide any explicit changes regarding the inclusion or exclusion of `__dict__`, or modifications to the `__slots__` attribute in the `Symbol` class that would suggest a direct cause for the reported change in behavior. Therefore, while the core code related to the `Symbol` class has been reviewed comprehensively, no specific code span directly addresses the introduction of the `__dict__` attribute in version 1.7, suggesting a gap in the understanding of how this new behavior was implemented or if it was unintentional.",

In version 1.6.2, instances of `Symbol` did not have a `__dict__` attribute, which aligns with the presence of `__slots__` containing only 'name'. However, in version 1.7, the `__dict__` attribute exists, possibly due to changes in the class hierarchy or how `__slots__` is defined in a parent class. The provided file context includes the `Symbol` class definition with `__slots__ = ('name',)`, and there is no direct reference to `__dict__`. This suggests that the change might be influenced by another part of the codebase not included here, potentially a parent class or a mixin class affecting how `__dict__` is handled. The task can be considered complete in identifying the relevant class and `__slots__` definition within the given context, but further investigation outside this file might be necessary to fully resolve the issue.",
