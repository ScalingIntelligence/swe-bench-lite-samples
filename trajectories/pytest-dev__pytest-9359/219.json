The specific files and functions that handle pytest's assertion rewriting include `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and `src/_pytest/_code/code.py`.

The issue seems to be related to how pytest calculates or displays line numbers in error messages. After analyzing the provided search results, it appears that the relevant code spans are found in 'src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py' and 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py'. In '__init__.py', the function 'pytest_runtest_protocol' handles the assertion hooks and the 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' function is defined, which is likely involved in how assertions are compared and reported. In 'rewrite.py', the 'AssertionRewriter' class and its methods 'visit_Assert' and '__init__' are responsible for rewriting assertions, which could be the source of the issue, especially if there are differences in how Python 3.9 handles AST transformations compared to Python 3.7.",
