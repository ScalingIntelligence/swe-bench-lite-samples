Specifically, the spans involving 'AssertionRewritingHook' and its methods like '_warn_already_imported', 'get_data', and 'get_resource_reader' (for Python 3.9) are relevant, as they deal with how pytest handles module imports and assertions. Additionally, the 'rewrite_asserts' function and the 'AssertionRewriter' class are central to how assertions are rewritten and could potentially hold the key to understanding why the extra line is being included in the error message. The 'visit_Assert' method within 'AssertionRewriter' is especially pertinent as it handles the rewriting of assert statements, which is precisely where the issue manifests. Given this, the search results seem comprehensive and relevant to addressing the issue.",
