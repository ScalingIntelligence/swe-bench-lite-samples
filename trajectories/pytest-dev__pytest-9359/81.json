The extra line in the error details corresponds to a decorator '@t'. This behavior does not occur in Python 3.7. The initial code and error traceback suggest an issue with how line numbers are calculated or how the assert statements are processed. Given the nature of the issue and the provided context, it's crucial to focus on the processing of assert statements and the pytest framework in Python 3.9. Specifically, the code spans that handle assertion rewriting and the pytest_assertrepr_compare hook should be examined. Additionally, the interaction of test functions with decorators might be relevant. Since the issue does not occur in earlier Python versions, the changes in how assertions are handled or how tracebacks are formatted in Python 3.9 are likely areas of interest.",
