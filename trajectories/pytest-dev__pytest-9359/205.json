In `rewrite.py`, the `AssertionRewriter` class handles the rewriting of asserts, which is critical for how assertions are evaluated and how error messages are generated. The class has methods for visiting `Assert` nodes and transforming them, including handling for custom error messages and the experimental `pytest_assertion_pass` hook.
