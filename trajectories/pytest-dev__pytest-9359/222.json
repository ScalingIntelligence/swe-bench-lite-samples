This issue is likely related to changes in how Python 3.9 handles tracebacks or assertion rewriting. The search results contain code spans from `src/_pytest/_code/code.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. These files are relevant because they handle the formatting of exceptions and the rewriting of assertions, respectively. Specifically, the `FormattedExcinfo` class in `code.py` deals with how traceback entries are formatted and represented, which could affect the display of assertion errors. Additionally, the `AssertionRewriter` class in `rewrite.py` is responsible for rewriting assert statements to provide detailed failure information, which could also influence the behavior of assert statements. Given the issue description, the relevant code spans are those that deal with traceback formatting and assertion rewriting. The `FormattedExcinfo.repr_traceback_entry` and `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` methods are particularly important as they handle the formatting of individual traceback entries and the rewriting of assert statements, respectively. These methods will likely contain the logic that determines whether and how extra code lines are included in the error output. Therefore, these spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
