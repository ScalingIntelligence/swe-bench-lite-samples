The issue does not occur in Python 3.7. This discrepancy suggests a problem in the assertion rewrite mechanism or the handling of assert statements between these Python versions. My analysis focuses on identifying relevant code spans in the provided search results that might relate to this issue.\n\nI start by examining the 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' file, which contains the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods responsible for rewriting assert statements. This is strongly linked to the problem, as the assertion rewriter is responsible for transforming assert statements to provide detailed failure messages. The `rewrite_asserts` function and the `visit_Assert` method within the `AssertionRewriter` class are particularly relevant, as they determine how the assert statements are rewritten and what context is included in the output.\n\nNext, I inspect the 'src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py' file, looking for the `pytest_runtest_protocol` function. This function is a hook that runs before and after a test, potentially controlling what is included in the error output. The creation of failure messages and the handling of assert comparisons are of primary interest.\n\nFinally, I briefly consider the 'src/_pytest/hookspec.py' file to understand the `pytest_runtest_protocol` hook specification. This helps in understanding the broader context of how pytest handles test execution, but isn't directly code where changes can be made to address the issue.\n\nThrough this analysis, I have identified critical code spans that deal with the rewriting of assert statements and the handling of assertions during test execution, which are directly related to the reported issue.",

The provided context and search results include code spans from `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py`. The relevant code spans in `rewrite.py` are primarily within the `AssertionRewriter` class, particularly the `visit_Assert` method, which handles the transformation of assert statements. The `pytest_runtest_protocol` and `pytest_assertrepr_compare` functions in `__init__.py` also play a role in handling assertions. Given the issue description, the focus seems to be on how assertions are rewritten and the differences in behavior between Python versions. The provided code spans in the search results continue to support the analysis of how assertions are processed and rewritten by pytest. Specifically, the `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` method's handling of assertion transformation is critical to understanding and potentially resolving the issue. The search results do not introduce new files or significantly new contexts, but they deepen the understanding of the code involved in assertion rewriting. The identified code spans are consistent with what would be expected to analyze and potentially modify to address the issue of extra lines being printed in error details for Python 3.9. The task is complete as the relevant code spans have been identified and analyzed, providing a sufficient basis for further addressing the issue.",
