The issue suggests a problem with line number calculations during assertion rewriting. Upon examining the search results, the most relevant code spans are found in 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py'. This file contains the AssertionRewritingHook and AssertionRewriter classes, which are responsible for rewriting assert statements to provide better error messages. Specifically, the 'visit_Assert' method in the AssertionRewriter class is critical as it handles the rewriting of assert statements. The '_should_rewrite' method in the AssertionRewritingHook class also offers insights into when assertions should be rewritten, which might influence the inclusion of extra lines. Other spans in this file, such as '_call_assertion_pass' and 'UNARY_MAP', are also related to assertion handling but less directly relevant to the issue of extra lines being printed.
