This discrepancy suggests a potential change in how the assertion error handling is processed between Python versions. The search results provided involve code from pytest, specifically modules related to assertion rewriting and handling. The `pytest_runtest_protocol` function is where the assertion handling is wrapped with custom hooks, including `pytest_assertrepr_compare` which provides custom explanations for failed assertions. The `AssertionRewriter` class in `rewrite.py` is responsible for rewriting assert statements to provide more informative failure messages, and it contains methods specifically designed to handle the assertion reformatting and pass hook implementation. This class and its methods are key to understanding how the assertions are processed and how they might be affected by changes between Python versions. The `FormattedExcinfo` class in `code.py` also plays a role in formatting the exception information, which might include the unwanted extra line in the error details. By examining these parts of the code, we can potentially identify where the extra line is being introduced and how to address it.",
