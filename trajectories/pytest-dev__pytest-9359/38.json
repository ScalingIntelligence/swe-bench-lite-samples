To diagnose this, we need to focus on code sections related to assertion handling, especially in the context of pytest's assertion rewriting and traceback formatting. Given the nature of the problem, the search should primarily target files related to assertion rewriting, traceback handling, and pytest's core functionality.",

The user has provided a test case where the test fails at the first assertion, but prints extra code (the 't' decorator) in the error details, which does not happen in Python 3.7. The issue seems to be related to how pytest handles assertion errors, potentially related to the line number calculation or the assertion rewriting mechanism.\n\nFrom the search results, the following sections appear relevant:\n\n1. **src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py**\n   - `pytest_runtest_protocol`: This function sets up hooks for handling assertion errors, including custom representations for comparison operations and handling of assertion pass hooks. This is directly related to assertion handling during test execution.\n   - `pytest_sessionfinish`: Cleans up the assertion state at the end of the session, which might be relevant for understanding state management.\n\n2. **src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py**\n   - `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert`: This method rewrites assert statements to include additional information for debugging. Given the issue involves detailed output on assertion failure, this section is highly relevant as it deals with how assertions are rewritten to provide more informative error messages.\n   - `_call_reprcompare`: This function calls a custom representation for comparison operations, which might be where the extra code (like the 't' decorator) is being introduced.\n\n3. **src/_pytest/_code/code.py**\n   - `FormattedExcinfo.get_exconly`: This method formats the exception only output, which could potentially include the extra code lines if not handled correctly. This is relevant for understanding how the exception output is being generated and formatted.\n\n4. **src/_pytest/fixtures.py**\n   - `FixtureRequest._factorytraceback`: This method generates a traceback for fixture factories, which might not be directly related to the reported issue. However, it does indicate how pytest handles tracebacks, which could be indirectly relevant if the traceback mechanism is involved in the extra line printing.\n\nBased on the relevance of the identified sections to the reported issue, the search task seems to be complete. The relevant code spans are found in the `pytest_runtest_protocol` and `visit_Assert` methods, which directly handle the assertion behavior and rewriting process.",
