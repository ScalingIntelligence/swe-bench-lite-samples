The span 'pytest_runtest_protocol' in '__init__.py' is responsible for handling the test run protocol and includes logic to manage assert hooks and configurations. The 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' span is also relevant as it deals with the comparison representation in assertion failures. In 'rewrite.py', the 'AssertionRewriter' class and its methods, particularly 'visit_Assert', are central to the assertion rewriting process, which could be where the issue of printing extra lines arises. This method visits and potentially rewrites assert statements, which could explain the differing behavior between Python versions. The 'AssertionRewriter' class initialization and the visit_Assert method are particularly relevant as they handle the rewriting of assert statements and could be the source of the extra line printing. Overall, these code spans are highly relevant to the issue as they deal directly with the pytest assertion handling and rewriting processes.",
