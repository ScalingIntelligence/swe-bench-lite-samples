This suggests a potential issue in the way asserts are being handled or displayed in the newer Python version. The search results provide context in two key files: '_pytest/assertion/__init__.py' and '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py'. In '__init__.py', the 'pytest_runtest_protocol' hook appears to manage assertion handling, particularly focusing on how assert comparison results are represented. The 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' function provides detailed comparison output for asserts. In 'rewrite.py', the 'AssertionRewriter' class is central to how assertions are rewritten and managed. Notably, the 'visit_Assert' method is responsible for customizing the behavior of assert statements during the rewrite process, which could be relevant given the differences between Python 3.9 and 3.7. Both files contain sections that directly handle assert behavior, making them highly relevant to the issue reported.",
