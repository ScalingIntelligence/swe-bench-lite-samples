This behavior is not observed in Python 3.7.10. The issue suggests a potential problem with the calculation of the statement line number or the handling of assertions. The search results provide relevant code spans from the '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and '_pytest/_code/code.py' files, which are responsible for assertion rewriting and handling exception information, respectively. Specifically, the 'AssertionRewriter' class in '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' is likely the focus, as it contains methods for visiting assertions and rewriting them. The 'visit_Assert' method within this class is particularly relevant, as it deals with the transformation of assert statements and the generation of error messages. This method includes logic for handling experimental assertion pass hooks and the original assertion rewriting, which could influence how error messages are constructed and displayed. Additionally, the 'FormattedExcinfo' class in '_pytest/_code/code.py' could also be relevant, as it formats exception information, including the 'get_exconly' method that constructs the exception output. These code spans should help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue related to extra code lines in error messages in pytest.",
