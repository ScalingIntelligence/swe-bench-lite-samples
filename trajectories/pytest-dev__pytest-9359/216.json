This behavior differs from that observed in Python 3.7.10, indicating a potential discrepancy in how Python 3.9 handles line numbers or decorators within tests. Given the nature of the problem, it is necessary to focus on files that deal with assertion handling and specifically those dealing with the pytest framework. The main focus should be on the pytest assertion rewrite mechanism and the error representation, as these are likely places where the unintended inclusion of extra lines in error messages is managed.",

This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with the handling of assertion rewriting in Python 3.9. The provided search results include several relevant files and spans within `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, especially the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods like `visit_Assert`, `visit_Name`, and `visit_Call`. These methods are directly involved in rewriting assertion statements to provide more detailed error messages. The key spans to examine are those that handle the assertion rewriting logic, as any discrepancies in how these are handled between Python versions could explain the observed behavior. Additionally, the `_get_assertion_exprs` function is relevant for understanding how assertion expressions are parsed and handled, which could also contribute to the issue. The `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` file also contains the `pytest_assertrepr_compare` function, which is relevant for customizing assertion comparison output, although it seems less directly related to the immediate issue. Overall, focusing on the `AssertionRewriter` methods and the `_get_assertion_exprs` function should provide enough context to diagnose and potentially resolve the reported issue.",

The description of the issue involving extra lines being printed in error details when using the assert statement in Python 3.9 particularly mentions a decorator. Given the class\u2019s methods and their roles in assertion handling, it appears that the file context provided is relevant to the issue reported.

The `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods, such as `visit_Assert` and `visit_Call`, are key to understanding how assertions are processed, including the handling of decorators and the line numbers involved. Given the initial issue with an extraneous line being printed when using the assert statement in Python 3.9 with a decorator, further examination of these specific methods is warranted. Additionally, focusing on the integration of decorators within the assertion rewriting process could uncover the source of the discrepancy. The presence of code that manages the depth and structure of asserts, as well as the handling of test definitions including decorators, suggests that this file is crucial for addressing the issue. The comparison of this behavior between Python 3.9 and Python 3.7 could be guided by examining specific versions of the code in this file and how they handle or include decorators in error messages.",

It is crucial to analyze this method for any discrepancies in handling assertions, especially when decorators are involved. The method processes the assertions, including their conditions and messages, and rearranges them to facilitate better debugging. The `visit_Call` method is also examined for its role in managing function calls, which can be relevant when decorators are used, as they often wrap functions into calls. Both methods are scrutinized for handling of line numbers and the interaction with decorators, as these could be the source of the extraneous line issue in Python 3.9. The investigation focuses on comparing how these methods work in Python 3.9 versus Python 3.7.10, particularly in scenarios with decorators.

The current file context points to `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` which contains the `AssertionRewriter` class responsible for rewriting assert statements. The search results also focus on this file, providing additional methods and attributes within the `AssertionRewriter` class that are relevant to the issue.\n\nThe key methods identified as relevant include `visit_Assert`, `visit_Call`, and `visit_Name`, which handle the rewriting of assert statements and the generation of error messages. The `_get_assertion_exprs` function, responsible for caching and retrieving assertion expressions, is also relevant. These methods are essential for understanding how the assertion rewriting and error message generation work, and how the decorator `@t` might be inadvertently included.",

The `visit_Assert` method is particularly relevant since it deals with the transformation of assert statements during the rewriting process. It is crucial to analyze this method for any discrepancies in handling assertions, especially when decorators are involved. The method processes the assertions, including their conditions and messages, and rearranges them to facilitate better debugging. The `visit_Call` method is also examined for its role in managing function calls, which can be relevant when decorators are used, as they often wrap functions into calls. Both methods are scrutinized for handling of line numbers and the interaction with decorators, as these could be the source of the extraneous line issue in Python 3.9. The investigation focuses on comparing how these methods work in Python 3.9 versus Python 3.7.10, particularly in scenarios with decorators. Additionally, special attention is given to the management and reporting of line numbers within these methods, especially in contexts where decorators might influence the structure and interpretation of the underlying code.",
