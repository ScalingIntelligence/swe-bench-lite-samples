The error details include the 't' decorator, suggesting an issue with how the line numbers are calculated or how the traceback is handled in Python 3.9. To resolve this, we need to investigate the assertion handling and traceback generation within the pytest framework, particularly in the files related to assertion rewrite and traceback formatting.",

This issue does not occur in Python 3.7. The provided search results include code from `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` which is relevant to this issue because it contains the `AssertionRewriter` class that is responsible for rewriting assertions. The methods within this class deal with handling assertions, rewriting them, and managing the display of error messages. The methods `visit_Assert`, `visit_Name`, `visit_BoolOp`, `visit_UnaryOp`, `visit_BinOp`, `visit_Call`, `visit_Starred`, `visit_Attribute`, and `visit_Compare` are particularly relevant as they handle different types of AST nodes during the assertion rewriting process. This directly relates to how assertions are processed and could explain the extra code lines being printed in the error messages. Additionally, `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` contains the `pytest_assertrepr_compare` function which is involved in generating the assertion comparison representations. This function could also be related to the issue at hand as it handles the display of assertion details.",
