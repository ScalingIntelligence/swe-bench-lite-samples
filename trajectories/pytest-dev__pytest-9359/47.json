The provided search results focus on the pytest assertion rewriting mechanism. The key focus seems to be on how assertions are processed and how the line numbers are handled. The `pytest_runtest_protocol` function is crucial as it sets up hooks for assertion comparison and handling. The `AssertionRewriter` class in `rewrite.py` is also critical, particularly the `visit_Assert` method, which handles the rewriting of assert statements. This method deals with the creation of failure messages and the handling of assertion pass hooks. Since the issue involves extra lines being printed in error details, the relevant spans include those dealing with how assertion errors are constructed and reported, particularly the part where the exception message is built. The span 'pytest_runtest_protocol' is relevant for understanding how the test is run and how assertions are hooked. The span 'AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert' is relevant because it directly handles the rewriting of assert statements, including the construction of error messages. The presence of extra lines in Python 3.9 compared to Python 3.7 might be due to differences in how these versions handle assertion rewriting or error message formatting.",
