The 'rewrite.py' file contains the 'AssertionRewriter' class which is responsible for rewriting assert statements, including the 'visit_Assert' method that handles the transformation of assert nodes into more informative forms, including the generation of failure messages. The '__init__.py' file includes a function 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' related to assertion representation in the output.

This discrepancy suggests that the issue might be related to how Python 3.9 handles the decorator during assertion rewriting. Based on the provided search results, the key areas to focus on would be the 'AssertionRewriter' class and its methods like 'visit_Assert', 'run', and '__init__'. These methods are responsible for rewriting assertions and managing the output of error messages. Specifically, the 'visit_Assert' method needs to ensure that only relevant code is included in the error details. The 'run' method should also be checked for any changes in handling decorators between Python versions. Finally, the '__init__' method initializes the rewrite process, so any differences in how it sets up the environment for rewriting assertions between Python 3.9 and Python 3.7 need to be considered.",

Specifically, modify the condition that sets the lineno to ensure it does not incorrectly include decorator lines in the assertion error output.\n\nThe lineno calculation logic that needs to be updated is within the condition that sets the lineno for a decorated function. Specifically, the condition on line 714 checks if the item is an instance of ast.FunctionDef and has a decorator_list. The current logic incorrectly sets the lineno to the first decorator's lineno. This needs to be corrected to exclude decorator lines.",
