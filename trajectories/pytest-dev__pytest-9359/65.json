The search results include several files and code spans that could be relevant to this issue. The 'src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py' file contains code related to the pytest_runtest_protocol hook, which is involved in the execution of tests and could potentially handle the assertions. Additionally, 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' includes the AssertionRewritingHook class and its methods, which manage the rewriting of assertions. This could be directly related to the issue, especially since function spans like '_get_assertion_exprs' could be dealing with the representation of assertion expressions. Furthermore, 'src/_pytest/_code/code.py' includes classes like TracebackEntry and FormattedExcinfo, which handle traceback formatting and might be responsible for the extra lines seen in the error output. Overall, these files appear to be relevant to the issue, as they cover aspects of assertion handling, rewriting, and error formatting in pytest. The identified code spans in these files could potentially contain the logic that controls how assertions are processed and displayed, including any differences between Python versions like 3.9 and 3.7.",
