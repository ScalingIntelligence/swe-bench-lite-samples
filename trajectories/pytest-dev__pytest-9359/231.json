The issue indicates a difference in behavior between Python 3.9 and Python 3.7, suggesting a potential bug or change in how pytest handles assertions. The relevant code spans are likely to be found in the pytest assertion rewrite module. From the search results, I've identified two key spans within the `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. These spans handle the rewriting of assertion statements to provide detailed failure messages. Specifically, the spans related to the `visit_Assert` method are crucial as they detail the process of creating failure messages and rewriting assertions. This method is responsible for handling the assertion logic, and any changes or errors in this logic could lead to the observed behavior. By examining these spans, I can better understand how the assertion rewriting process works and identify any potential discrepancies that might cause the extra line to be printed in the error details.",
