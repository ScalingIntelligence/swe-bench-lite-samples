            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves an extra code line being printed during assertion failure in Python 3.9, which does not occur in Python 3.7. This suggests a difference in handling assertions between these Python versions. The search results provide valuable insights into how assertions are handled and rewritten in the pytest framework. \n\nIn 'src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py', the 'pytest_runtest_protocol' function is responsible for handling test execution and assertion processing, including setting up hooks for assertion comparison and passing. The 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' function is also defined here to provide detailed comparison output for assertions.\n\nIn 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py', the 'AssertionRewriter' class is key as it rewrites assertion statements to provide better failure messages. The '__init__' method initializes the rewriter with configuration and source code. The 'visit_Assert' method is particularly relevant as it processes 'assert' statements. This method includes handling for assertion pass hooks, which might be related to the issue if there's a version-specific difference in how these hooks are processed or enabled.\n\nGiven the identified code spans, it seems plausible that the difference in assertion handling between Python 3.9 and 3.7 could be rooted in how the 'AssertionRewriter' or the hooks are implemented or invoked. Specifically, the handling of assertion pass hooks and the order of operations in 'visit_Assert' could be key areas to investigate further.\n\nTo resolve the issue, one could start by comparing the assertion rewriting and hook handling in Python 3.9 and 3.7 environments, focusing on the differences in 'visit_Assert' and the setup of assertion pass hooks.",
