            "scratch_pad": "1. Analyzing User Instructions: The reported issue is about an error message printing extra code line when using assert in Python 3.9, specifically mentioning that a test fails at the first assertion and prints the 't' decorator in error details. It also notes that this behavior does not occur in Python 3.7.10.\n\n2. Reviewing Current Context: The current file context provided shows a class `AssertionRewritingHook` and a class `AssertionRewriter` from `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. The relevant code spans involve methods such as `__init__`, `find_spec`, `create_module`, `_should_rewrite`, `_is_marked_for_rewrite`, `_warn_already_imported`, and `visit_Assert`.\n\n3. Process New Search Results: Analyzing the new search results shows continued involvement of the `AssertionRewritingHook` and `AssertionRewriter` classes, pointing to the core part of the issue likely being tied to how assertions are rewritten in pytest for Python 3.9. The new spans provide more context, such as how the session is set, how module specs are found, and how the assertion rewriting process determines if a rewrite is necessary. In particular, the `visit_Assert` method is highlighted again, emphasizing its importance in the rewriting process.\n\n4. Drawing Conclusion: Given the information, it is clear that the files `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and methods `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` and `_call_assertion_pass` are highly relevant as they handle the rewriting of assertions, which ties directly to the user's issue. Additionally, the fact that the issue specifically mentions Python 3.9 behavior suggests that changes in the implementation or use of assertion rewriting between Python versions might be causing the extra code line to be printed in error details.",

This suggests that the behavior change observed in Python 3.9 might be linked to the adaptation to the new resource handling capabilities in this version of Python. Additionally, the 'AssertionRewriter' class undergoes changes in its handling of assert statements, particularly the addition of checks and transformations in Python 3.9 that might impact error reporting.
