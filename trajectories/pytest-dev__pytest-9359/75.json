The issue specifically points out that the 't' decorator code is being printed in the error details, which does not occur in Python 3.7. From the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file, particularly in the `AssertionRewriter` class, which handles the rewriting of assertions to provide more informative error messages. The methods `visit_Assert`, `visit_Name`, `visit_BoolOp`, `visit_UnaryOp`, `visit_BinOp`, `visit_Call`, `visit_Starred`, `visit_Attribute`, and `visit_Compare` within this class are directly involved in processing different types of AST nodes that could be part of an assert statement. These methods are crucial for understanding how the assertion messages are generated and potentially manipulated, which might lead to the inclusion of extra lines in the error message. The `pytest_runtest_protocol` and `pytest_assertrepr_compare` functions in `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` also play a role in the testing protocol and how assertion comparisons are represented, which could be related to the issue. Given this analysis, the search task can consider this data as relevant to the reported issue.",
