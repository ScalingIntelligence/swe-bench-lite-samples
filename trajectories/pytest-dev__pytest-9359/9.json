I will analyze these files to identify code spans that might be relevant to the issue. The relevant files might include those handling assertion rewriting, error reporting, and debugging hooks. After a thorough review, I determined that the files 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and 'src/_pytest/debugging.py' contain code spans that are highly relevant to the issue. The span 'AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert' in 'rewrite.py' is particularly relevant as it deals directly with the processing of assert statements.
