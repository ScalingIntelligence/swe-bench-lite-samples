Given the nature of the problem, the focus should be on the assertion rewriting and handling mechanisms in pytest, especially in how they interact with line numbers and source code during assertion failures. The provided search results include two key files: '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and '_pytest/assertion/__init__.py'. The 'AssertionRewriter' class in 'rewrite.py' is likely to be central to how assertions are rewritten and handled in pytest. Additionally, the '__init__.py' file contains hooks related to the pytest run test protocol and assertion representation comparison, which are directly involved in handling assertion failures. The 'AssertionRewriter.__init__' method is relevant as it initializes the assertion rewriter with module path, configuration, and source code, which sets up the context for rewriting assertions. The 'pytest_runtest_protocol' function and 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' function handle the pytest run test protocol and assertion representation comparison respectively, making them critical in understanding how assertions are processed and displayed upon failure.",
