Given the detailed description, it sounds like the problem might be related to the internal handling of assertion rewriting and traceback formatting in pytest when dealing with decorated functions. To pinpoint the issue, we should focus our search on the modules responsible for assertion handling and traceback rendering in the pytest source code, especially in Python 3.9 specific contexts.",

This issue does not occur in Python 3.7. The user suspects there might be an issue with how line numbers are calculated. To address this, one must focus on the logic handling assertion rewriting and comparison reporting in pytest's source code. The search results show several relevant files and code spans: 1. src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py - Specifically, the function pytest_runtest_protocol is relevant as it handles the execution of test items. The callbinrepr function might be involved in handling binary representation of comparisons. 2. src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py - The rewrite_asserts function and the AssertionRewriter class are crucial as they handle the rewriting of assert statements, potentially relevant to the error display. 3. src/_pytest/assertion/util.py - This file contains utility functions that might be used during assertion comparison and formatting. Identified key functions and classes from these files that could have an impact on the issue's resolution are pytest_runtest_protocol, rewrite_asserts, AssertionRewriter, and util.assertrepr_compare. These elements are essential for understanding and resolving the discrepancy in assertion report line numbers across Python versions.",

This behavior differs from Python 3.7, where the extra line is not printed. The issue could be related to how the line numbers are calculated during the assertion rewrites or how the error context is captured. The provided code spans from the search results include functions related to rewriting asserts and handling assertion output, such as '_rewrite_test', 'rewrite_asserts', and 'AssertionRewriter'. These functions and classes are responsible for modifying the assertion statements before execution and for handling the output of failed assertions. Given the issue description and the context of the code spans, it is likely that the problem lies within these functions or their interactions.
