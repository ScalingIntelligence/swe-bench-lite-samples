Differences in assertion handling between Python 3.9 and 3.7. The provided search results contain two files: 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and 'src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py'. In 'rewrite.py', the 'AssertionRewriter' class and its 'visit_Assert' method are particularly relevant, as they handle the rewriting of assert statements and could be where the issue lies with the extra line being added. The 'visit_Assert' method has several elements that could contribute to the issue, such as the handling of the assert message and the stack context, which might be mismanaging line numbers or contexts. In '__init__.py', the 'pytest_runtest_protocol' function and the 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' function are also relevant, as they handle the execution protocol for tests and the representation of assertion comparisons, respectively. These could also be involved in the discrepancy.",

Notably, the code uses the 'ast' module to manipulate and rewrite the AST nodes of the assert statements for enhanced reporting. This process involves creating conditions and generating customized error messages based on these conditions. The discrepancy in behavior between Python 3.7 and 3.9 could be due to differences in how Python's ast or traceback modules handle such manipulations, possibly with different line number handling or traceback construction logic. The suggestion is to focus on 'visit_Assert', '_format_explanation', and the 'ast.NodeVisitor' class in 'rewrite.py', and 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' and 'pytest_runtest_protocol' in '__init__.py' where the core logic for handling and formatting assertions is found, and specifically check for any changes or conditions in these sections that could cause the additional code line to appear in Python 3.9 only.",

The issue does not manifest in Python 3.7. The provided file context includes a significant portion of the `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, which is responsible for rewriting assertions to provide more informative failure messages. This class contains methods such as `visit_Assert`, `visit_Name`, `visit_BoolOp`, `visit_UnaryOp`, `visit_BinOp`, `visit_Call`, `visit_Starred`, `visit_Attribute`, and `visit_Compare`, which are relevant for understanding and handling different aspects of assertion expressions. The new code spans provided in the search results reveal additional methods in the `AssertionRewriter` class, such as `run`, `is_rewrite_disabled`, `variable`, `assign`, `display`, `helper`, `builtin`, `explanation_param`, `push_format_context`, `pop_format_context`, and `generic_visit`. These methods are instrumental in the assertion rewriting process. Additionally, the search results include the `pytest_runtest_protocol` and `pytest_assertrepr_compare` functions from `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py`, which are involved in the pytest run-test protocol and assertion representation comparison, respectively. Given the detailed nature of the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods, it appears that the search results encompass the necessary code spans to address the issue of the extra code line in assertion error messages for Python 3.9.",

The provided context from 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and 'src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py' shows how pytest handles assertions and formats them for output, with specific attention to how the assertion message is constructed and how it interacts with Python's built-in traceback and assertion error mechanisms. Notably, the code uses the 'ast' module to manipulate and rewrite the AST nodes of the assert statements for enhanced reporting. This process involves creating conditions and generating customized error messages based on these conditions. The discrepancy in behavior between Python 3.7 and 3.9 could be due to differences in how Python's ast or traceback modules handle such manipulations, possibly with different line number handling or traceback construction logic. The suggestion is to focus on 'visit_Assert', '_format_explanation', and the 'ast.NodeVisitor' class in 'rewrite.py', and 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' and 'pytest_runtest_protocol' in '__init__.py' where the core logic for handling and formatting assertions is found, and specifically check for any changes or conditions in these sections that could cause the additional code line to appear in Python 3.9 only.",
