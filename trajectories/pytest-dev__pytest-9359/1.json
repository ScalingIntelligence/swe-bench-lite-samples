This suggests a potential regression or a change in behavior related to assertion handling or error reporting in Python 3.9. The focus should be on the assertion rewriting or traceback formatting functions in pytest, particularly where the handling of line numbers and source code context might differ between Python versions. Given the provided context, the file 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and its 'AssertionRewriter' class, which is responsible for rewriting assertions to include debugging information, are likely places to start. Additionally, 'src/_pytest/_code/code.py', which contains the 'FormattedExcinfo' class responsible for formatting exception information, could be relevant. Both need to be examined to understand how they handle and format assert statements and tracebacks.",
