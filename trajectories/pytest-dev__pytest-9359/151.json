However, this does not happen when using Python 3.7. The issue seems to be related to the calculation of the statement's line number or the handling of the assert statement itself in Python 3.9.\n\nThe search results point to several relevant files and functions within the '_pytest/assertion' module that could be responsible for handling assertions and their output. Specifically, the 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' function in 'util.py' and the 'AssertionRewriter' class in 'rewrite.py' are key components dealing with assertion rewriting and comparison explanations. Additionally, the 'truncate' module handles the truncation of error explanations, which could also be related to the issue if the truncation logic behaves differently in Python 3.9.\n\nThe identified spans include 'assertrepr_compare', 'pytest_assertrepr_compare', 'AssertionRewriter', and '_truncate_explanation', which are all directly involved in processing and formatting assertion errors. These functions should be inspected further to determine how they handle or format the extra lines of code in the output.",

The most relevant files seem to be '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and '_pytest/assertion/util.py'. In '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py', the AssertionRewriter class and its methods handle the rewriting of assert statements, which could be where the extra line is being introduced. Specifically, the 'visit_Assert' method processes the assert statements and constructs the failure messages. Additionally, '_pytest/assertion/util.py' contains the 'assertrepr_compare' function, which generates the comparison representations for assertions, potentially involving the extra line in its output. Thus, these areas of the codebase are directly involved in handling the assert statements and their results, making them relevant to the reported issue.",

Although the file context does not explicitly start with the code where the method `visit_Assert` relies on for rewrite operation, further research on 'visit_Assert` should be found from line 323 within `rewrite.py` which seems on the right track when drilling into the raised error that exactly causes the issue, indicating that other key lines may give more clues of the 'assert'. Hence a deeper, line-by-line examination around that line may provide greater insight particularly focusing on line 373 on `rewrite.py`, note to avoid revising or writing code just looking and determining the exact cause being encoding pattern related or top-condition handling restructuring. However, from the finite context provided here, we identify related code but still prompt for more extensive context for fully covering this situation as-is specifically significant crucial piece to resolve the fuzzy where the assertion is failing.",

This method is responsible for transforming assert statements into more detailed forms that provide better error messages. Given the complexity of the method and the involvement of decorators and assertions within the code snippets provided, it is critical to analyze line 373 and its surrounding code within `visit_Assert`. This analysis should focus on how assertions are rewritten and how error messages are generated and manipulated. Additionally, considering the `assertrepr_compare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` could provide further insight into how assertion explanations are generated, which might also correlate with the issue described.

The evidence suggests that the problem lies within the implementation of `visit_Assert` in the `AssertionRewriter` class found in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. This method is responsible for transforming assert statements into more detailed forms that provide better error messages. Given the complexity of the method and the information from the issue description, it is critical to analyze line 373 and its surrounding code within `visit_Assert`. This analysis should focus on how assertions are rewritten and how error messages are generated and manipulated. Additionally, considering the `assertrepr_compare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` could provide further insight into how assertion explanations are generated, which might also correlate with the issue described. This detailed comparison between the implementations might reveal the specific transformation that introduces the extra lines in the assertion error output in Python 3.9.",
