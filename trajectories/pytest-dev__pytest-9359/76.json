The reported issue pertains to an extra code line being printed when using `assert` in Python 3.9, which involves a problem with the pytest framework's handling of assertion errors. 2. The key focus is on understanding why the 't' decorator is being included in the error details during assertion failures in Python 3.9 but not in Python 3.7.10. 3. Reviewing the search results, it's important to identify code spans that deal with assertion handling, specifically the generation of error messages and tracing of line numbers during assertions. 4. In the 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py', the 'AssertionRewriter' class and its methods like 'visit_Assert' are crucial as they handle the rewriting of assert statements, which might be where the issue originates related to the printing of extra code lines. 5. Additionally, the 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' function and the 'pytest_runtest_protocol' hook wrapper in 'src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py' are relevant as they deal with custom assertion explanations and the pytest test running protocol, respectively. 6.

The error message includes an extra line of code, specifically the 't' decorator, in the assertion failure details, which does not occur in the same context under Python 3.7. This discrepancy might be due to differences in how the line numbers or the assertion context are handled in the AST rewriting in Python 3.9 versus Python 3.7.\n\nReviewing the provided code spans, the relevant sections appear to be those within `AssertionRewriter` class in the `rewrite.py` file. Specifically, the `visit_Assert` method is where the assertion rewriting logic is implemented. This method constructs the failure message and handles the assertion pass hook. The involvement of decorators like 't' in the reported issue's context suggests that the method processing the line number or generating the failure message might be including extra lines under Python 3.9.\n\nFurthermore, the `pytest_runtest_protocol` in `__init__.py` is also relevant because it sets up the environment for handling assertions, including the assertion comparison and the pass hook. This function could indirectly contribute to the issue if the setup or teardown of assertion handling changes between Python versions.\n\nGiven the similarity between the provided file context and the new search results, it is evident that the identified spans in the new search results are consistent with the initial analysis. The relevant code spans are thus confirmed to be within the `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` and `pytest_runtest_protocol` methods. These spans should help in further debugging to determine why the extra line is included in the error message under Python 3.9.",

Notable is the handling of 'negation' and the conditional checks for 'enable_assertion_pass_hook' which might be relevant to the extra line issue. Additionally, the '__init__' method sets up the AssertionRewriter with configurations that might affect how assertions are processed and represented in tracebacks.
