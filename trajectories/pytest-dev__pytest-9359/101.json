The focus is on the test 'test_right_statement' and the 'assert' statements within it. The error message includes the 't' decorator in its details, indicating a potential problem with how the assertion's line number is being calculated or displayed. The search results include several relevant files and spans that could be related to handling assertions, rewriting, and comparing expressions. These include spans dealing with pytest_runtest_protocol, pytest_assertrepr_compare, and the AssertionRewriter class. Specifically, the spans related to callbinrepr, pytest_assertrepr_compare, and _get_assertion_exprs seem most relevant as they directly handle assertion comparison, representation, and rewriting. These spans are likely where the extra line might be introduced or managed. Additionally, the assertion's handling in Python 3.9 vs. 3.7 could stem from changes in how assertion rewriting or comparison is processed in the different Python versions. Thus, these spans should be further analyzed to understand the discrepancy and potential bugs.",
