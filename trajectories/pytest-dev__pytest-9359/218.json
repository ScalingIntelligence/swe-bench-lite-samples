Specifically, the `AssertionRewriter` class contains methods that handle the rewriting of assertions, including `visit_Assert`, `visit_BoolOp`, `visit_UnaryOp`, `visit_BinOp`, `visit_Call`, `visit_Starred`, `visit_Attribute`, and `visit_Compare`. These methods are critical for understanding how assertions are processed and could potentially be where the issue arises, especially considering the difference in behavior between Python versions.
