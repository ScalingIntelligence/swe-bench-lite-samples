The initialization of the `AssertionRewriter` class also suggests that it can be configured differently based on the pytest configuration, which might include settings specific to different Python versions. Meanwhile, the `pytest_runtest_protocol` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` is responsible for managing the execution of tests, including how assertion failures are processed and reported. This function sets up hooks for custom comparison and assertion pass handling, indicating that there is a mechanism in place to possibly customize or adapt how assertions are handled based on various conditions. The yield statement in `pytest_runtest_protocol` implies that this function operates in a context where it can temporarily halt execution to allow for other processing, possibly including version-specific adjustments to assertion handling. Together, these pieces of code suggest a complex system for assertion handling in pytest, one that involves rewriting assertions at a fundamental level, managing state and variables during this rewriting, and potentially customizing the handling and reporting of assertion failures based on hooks and configuration options. This complexity could likely lead to differences in how assertions are processed and errors are reported across different Python versions, suggesting a need to explore deeper into how these systems interact and adapt specifically to the Python versions in question.",

The method also handles the case where the assertion test is a tuple, issuing a warning if it is, and generally manages the creation of the error message for when an assertion fails, including the handling of custom messages provided by the user. The initialization of the `AssertionRewriter` class also suggests that it can be configured differently based on the pytest configuration, which might include settings specific to different Python versions. Meanwhile, the `pytest_runtest_protocol` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` is responsible for managing the execution of tests, including how assertion failures are processed and reported. This function sets up hooks for custom comparison and assertion pass handling, indicating that there is a mechanism in place to possibly customize or adapt how assertions are handled based on various conditions. The yield statement in `pytest_runtest_protocol` implies that this function operates in a context where it can temporarily halt execution to allow for other processing, possibly including version-specific adjustments to assertion handling. Together, these pieces of code suggest a complex system for assertion handling in pytest, one that involves rewriting assertions at a fundamental level, managing state and variables during this rewriting, and potentially customizing the handling and reporting of assertion failures based on hooks and configuration options. This complexity could likely lead to differences in how assertions are processed and errors are reported across different Python versions, suggesting a need to explore deeper into how these systems interact and adapt specifically to the Python versions in question.",
