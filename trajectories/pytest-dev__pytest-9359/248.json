The issue does not occur in Python 3.7.10. The main focus should be on the AssertionRewriter class in the rewrite.py file, as it handles the rewriting of assert statements. The user's test code includes the 't' decorator, which might be causing the issue with the assertion rewriting mechanism. We need to identify the specific sections in the AssertionRewriter class that handle the assert statements and the decorators. The search results provide several relevant code spans in the src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py file, including the AssertionRewriter class definition and its methods like __init__, visit_Assert, visit_UnaryOp, visit_BinOp, visit_Call, visit_Starred, and visit_Attribute. These methods are particularly relevant as they handle different AST nodes related to assert statements and their rewriting. Additionally, the _call_assertion_pass and _check_if_assertion_pass_impl functions are relevant as they handle the experimental pytest_assertion_pass hook, which might be related to the issue. Based on the reported issue and the provided search results, these code spans are deemed relevant and should be further investigated to identify the cause of the extra code lines being printed in error details.",

It would be beneficial to compare this method across versions of Python to identify potential changes or differences in handling decorators.
