Specifically, when the assertion fails in Python 3.9, it incorrectly includes an unrelated decorator ('@t') in the error details. This suggests a potential problem with how the assertion machinery or traceback handling is being interpreted or processed in Python 3.9. The search should focus on the assertion rewriting mechanism and traceback formatting in pytest, which is likely where the error lies. The file context provided includes several candidates, particularly those involved in assertion handling and traceback display.",

The primary suspect for this issue is the assertion rewriter in pytest, as evidenced by the search results which include the AssertionRewriter class in src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py. This class is responsible for rewriting assert statements to provide more informative error messages. The specific methods related to rewriting asserts, managing variables, and handling the assert conditions are crucial to investigate. Additionally, the context where the assert statement is being re-written, such as visit_Assert method, should be carefully examined for any discrepancies between Python versions. The provided code spans in the search results align well with the reported issue, suggesting that these parts of the code are indeed relevant to the problem at hand. Specifically, the methods like visit_Assert, visit_BoolOp, visit_BinOp, and other related methods that handle the rewriting of the assert statements need to be thoroughly checked for differences in behavior between Python versions.",

Specifically, the `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` is responsible for rewriting assert statements, which is likely where the issue lies, given the described behavior change in Python 3.9. The `visit_Assert` method within this class handles the transformation of assert statements, and modifications within this method could affect how assertions are processed and reported in the traceback. Other parts of the file context, such as the `pytest_runtest_protocol` in `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py`, also touch on aspects of assertion handling, specifically related to hooks and configuration of the assertion mechanics during test execution. These components are directly related to the reported issue as they influence how assert statements are evaluated and reported when they fail.
