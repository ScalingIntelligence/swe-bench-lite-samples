This does not occur in Python 3.7. The issue seems to be related to how the line number is calculated or how the assertion error is formatted. The relevant files could be those dealing with assertion rewriting or handling assertion errors, such as '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and '_pytest/assertion/__init__.py'. Additionally, '_pytest/doctest.py' and '_pytest/python.py' might also be relevant due to their handling of test item representation and function definition respectively.",

In `rewrite.py`, the `AssertionRewriter` class and its `visit_Assert` method are likely responsible for handling assertion rewriting, which might be where the extra lines are being introduced. Additionally, in the `__init__.py` file, the `pytest_runtest_protocol` and `pytest_assertrepr_compare` functions are relevant as they handle the runtime protocol and assertion comparison representation, respectively.

The AssertionRewriter class in 'rewrite.py' specifically deals with visiting 'Assert' nodes in the AST and rewrites them to include detailed failure messages. This class includes methods for handling assertion pass hooks and for formatting assertion messages, which are likely points of interest for the reported issue about extra code lines in error details. Additionally, 'pytest_runtest_protocol' in '__init__.py' sets up hooks for assertion representation and pass handling, which may also be relevant to the issue. Given that these files cover the main areas of pytest's assertion handling, they likely contain the relevant code for addressing the issue.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to an error message that includes extra code lines when using the assert statement in Python 3.9, specifically noting that the 't' decorator code appears in the error details. This behavior contrasts with Python 3.7, where the issue does not occur. The key focus here is on understanding how the assertion error messages are generated and manipulated in the pytest framework. The `AssertionRewriter` class and its `visit_Assert` method in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` are crucial as they handle the rewriting of assert statements for better reporting. The `pytest_runtest_protocol` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` is also relevant as it wraps the test execution and sets up hooks for assertion handling. Given the detailed nature of the issue, it seems that the problem might lie in how the assertion rewriting process in Python 3.9 handles the inclusion of additional code blocks, such as decorators, during error reporting. Specifically, the `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` method appears to be the primary candidate for investigation, as it constructs the failure message and handles the rewriting of assertion statements. Initially, both files and their spans are already in context, indicating a deep investigation into these areas. The additional search results confirm and elaborate on the presence and behavior of relevant code spans. Therefore, the search task is likely to be focusing on refining the understanding and possibly correcting the handling of decorators within the `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` method.",
