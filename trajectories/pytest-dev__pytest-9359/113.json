In the search results, the same files are present, with relevant code spans related to assertion handling and rewriting. The 'AssertionRewriter' class in 'rewrite.py' is particularly significant as it handles the rewriting of assert statements, which is likely where the issue arises. The 'pytest_runtest_protocol' and 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' functions in '__init__.py' are also relevant as they deal with assertion comparison and runtime protocol. The analysis of these code spans suggests that the issue might be related to how the assertion rewriting is handled in Python 3.9, possibly due to differences in how line numbers are calculated or how the assertion context is managed. Further analysis in the 'AssertionRewriter' class, especially in the 'visit_Assert' method, would be crucial to identify if there are any conditions or calculations that might cause the extra code line to be included in the error details.",
