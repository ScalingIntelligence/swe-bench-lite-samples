This behavior does not occur in Python 3.7.10. The key element to focus on is the handling of assertions, especially in Python 3.9. The relevant code spans are primarily in the 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' file, particularly the methods within the 'AssertionRewriter' class responsible for rewriting assertions. These methods include 'visit_Assert', 'visit_Name', 'visit_Call', 'visit_Starred', 'visit_Attribute', and 'visit_Compare'. Each of these methods is involved in processing different parts of the assertion statement and transforming them, which could be where the issue arises. Additionally, the 'run' method in the same class sets up the environment for assertion rewriting. In the 'src/_pytest/python.py' file, the 'Function' class and its methods are relevant, especially '_prunetraceback', as it handles the pruning of tracebacks, which might contain the extra line information. The search results confirm these suspicions and provide complete views of the functions mentioned, allowing for a thorough analysis to identify where and why the extra line is being included in the error output. Given the detailed context, the relevance of these code spans to the reported issue has been confirmed.",
