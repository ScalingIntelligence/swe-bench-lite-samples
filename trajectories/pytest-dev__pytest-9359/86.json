This behavior is not observed in Python 3.7. This discrepancy could be due to changes in how Python 3.9 handles tracebacks or assertions compared to previous versions. Given the issue description, it's important to focus on the `pytest_runtest_protocol` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` and the assertion rewriting process in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. These areas involve the core pytest functionality for running tests and handling assertions, and changes in error reporting/tracebacks might be related to these components.",

This behavior is not observed in Python 3.7.10. The issue seems to be related to the assertion rewriting functionality in pytest.\n\nFrom the provided search results, there are several relevant code spans that might address the issue. These include:\n1. `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` - This file contains various hooks and functions related to assertion handling, such as `pytest_addoption`, `register_assert_rewrite`, and `pytest_runtest_protocol`. These functions are responsible for setting up the assertion rewriting and handling the pytest run protocol, which includes the assertion comparison and error reporting.\n2. `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` - This file contains the `AssertionRewriter` class, which implements the logic for rewriting assert statements in test modules. Key methods include `visit_Assert`, `visit_Name`, `visit_Call`, `visit_Starred`, `visit_Attribute`, and `visit_Compare`. These methods handle the rewriting of different AST nodes involved in assert statements, including the handling of decorators and the generation of error messages.\n\nThe issue might be related to how the `AssertionRewriter` handles decorators or how the error messages are constructed in the `visit_Assert` method. Specifically, the extra code line might be due to the inclusion of decorator information in the error message generation.\n\nGiven the provided search results, I recommend focusing on the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods to further investigate and address the issue of the extra code line in the error details.",

The 'pytest_runtest_protocol' function sets up the environment for handling assertions and their output, while the 'AssertionRewriter' class is responsible for rewriting assert statements to provide detailed output. The 'visit_Assert' method in 'AssertionRewriter' specifically deals with the transformation of assert statements, which is critical for understanding why the extra code line is appearing.
