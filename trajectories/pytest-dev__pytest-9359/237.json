To address this, we should focus on the assertion rewriting mechanism used by pytest to understand how it processes and formats assertion failures, including any changes introduced in Python 3.9 that might affect this process. Additionally, we should also look into how decorators are being handled within the assertion context to understand if they are being mistakenly included in the error details.",

This suggests a potential problem with the line number calculation or the assertion rewriting mechanism in pytest's `AssertionRewriter`. The provided search results include the `AssertionRewriter` class from `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, which is responsible for rewriting assert statements to provide better failure messages. The `visit_Assert` method is particularly relevant as it handles the transformation of assert nodes. It appears that the method constructs the failure message differently based on the `self.enable_assertion_pass_hook` configuration, which might be related to the issue. The method also includes logic to push and pop the format context and construct detailed explanations for assertion failures. This code span directly relates to the issue by handling how the failure messages are formatted and whether additional context (such as decorators) are included.
