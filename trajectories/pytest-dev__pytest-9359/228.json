The error message in the test output includes extra lines of code, specifically the 't' decorator, which should not be included in the error details. This discrepancy is not present when using Python 3.7. The provided search results include two files, 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' and 'src/_pytest/_code/code.py', which are relevant to the issue due to their handling of assertion rewriting and exception information formatting, respectively. The 'AssertionRewriter' class in 'rewrite.py' is particularly relevant as it directly deals with the rewriting of assert statements to provide more detailed failure messages. The 'visit_Assert' method within this class contains logic for handling assertion failures and formatting the error messages. The 'FormattedExcinfo' class in 'code.py' also appears relevant as it is responsible for formatting exception information, including the 'get_exconly' method which formats the exception output for display. Based on the issue description and the provided code snippets, the identified spans seem to be directly related to the problem at hand. The 'visit_Assert' method in 'AssertionRewriter' modifies assert statements, potentially influencing how traceback information is gathered and presented. The 'get_exconly' method in 'FormattedExcinfo' formats the exception's only text, which is crucial for the error display. Both of these sections of code are likely places to start investigating the root cause of the issue. The provided context and search results show promising avenues for addressing the user's problem concerning the display of superfluous code lines in error messages when using Python 3.9.",
