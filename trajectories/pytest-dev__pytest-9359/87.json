The search results provided include code from '_pytest/assertion/__init__.py', which is pertinent as it deals with the pytest assertion handling, hooks, and comparison operations during test execution. The code span with id 'pytest_runtest_protocol' is particularly relevant as it encapsulates the runtime protocol for pytest tests, including how assertion hooks are managed and how comparison results are handled. This span contains the logic for managing assertion representations and hooks, which could be where the discrepancy arises between Python versions. The second code span with id 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' is also relevant as it directly deals with the representation comparison for assertions and could be a key area to investigate further for differences in behavior between Python 3.9 and 3.7.",
