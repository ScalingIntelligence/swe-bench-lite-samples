The provided search results offer insights into how pytest handles assertions and might contribute to the discrepancy observed. The key areas of interest in the search results are:\n1. The `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, particularly the `visit_Assert` method which includes logic for rewriting assert statements to enhance error messaging. The method also contains logic for handling experimental `pytest_assertion_pass` hook, which could influence how assertions are interpreted and reported.\n2. The `assertrepr_compare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, responsible for comparing values and generating explanations for assertion failures. Its inner functions like `_compare_eq_any` and `_notin_text` handle detailed comparison logic which directly affects the output of assertion failures.\nConsidering the mismatch between Python versions described in the issue, these two sections of the code are the most relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the issue. The extra code line printed during assertion failures in Python 3.9 (compared to Python 3.7) could be a result of differences in how these components function between the versions. Further detailed analysis and possibly a minimal reproducible example would be beneficial to diagnose and resolve the problem precisely.",
