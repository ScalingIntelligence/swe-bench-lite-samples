From the provided search results, the following code spans appear relevant:\n\n1. The 'AssertionRewritingHook' class in 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' which is responsible for the assertion rewriting mechanism.\n2. The 'visit_Assert' method within the 'AssertionRewriter' class, also in 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py', which specifically handles the rewriting of assert statements.\n3. The 'rewrite_asserts' function, which triggers the assertion rewriting process.\n\nThese code spans directly relate to the assertion rewriting and error handling mechanisms, making them highly relevant to the reported issue. They provide the necessary context for understanding and potentially resolving the issue related to the extra code line being printed.\n\nConsidering the information provided and the relevance of the identified code spans, it appears that the search task can be considered complete as the relevant code has been identified.\n",

This behavior does not occur in Python 3.7.10. The issue seems to be related to how the line numbers are being calculated during assertion rewriting. The provided search results include several key sections of the `AssertionRewriter` class, which is responsible for rewriting asserts. The `visit_Assert` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class processes the assert statements and could be where the issue arises concerning extra lines being included in the error details. It's crucial to identify if the logic for handling asserts in Python 3.9 differs from that in Python 3.7, potentially due to handling decorators or line numbers differently. The new search results confirm the presence of the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods involved in handling asserts, such as `visit_Assert`, `visit_UnaryOp`, `visit_Call`, `visit_Starred`, and `visit_Attribute`, which are likely relevant to understand how the assertion is being processed and why the decorator 't' is appearing in the error message. The `AssertionRewritingHook` class and its methods are also present, which handle the import and rewriting of Python modules, indicating that the code spans identified are close to the actual implementation of the assertion rewriting functionality. Based on the context and the search results, it appears that the code spans related to the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods are the most relevant to the reported issue.",

This suggests a discrepancy in how assertions are handled between the two Python versions. The current context already points to the AssertionRewritingHook and AssertionRewriter classes in the src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py file, specifically focusing on the assertion rewriting process. The provided search results expand on this context by including additional parts of the AssertionRewriter class.\n\nAnalyzing the search results and the current context, the relevant parts appear to be the methods within the AssertionRewriter class that handle the actual rewriting of assert statements. Notably, the visit_Assert method specifically deals with transforming assert statements into a form that can be used to generate detailed error messages. This method seems crucial for understanding how assert statements are processed and why there might be a difference between Python versions. The visit_Assert method includes logic for handling both the original assertion rewriting and an experimental assertion pass hook, which could be related to the reported issue. Additionally, the initiation of the AssertionRewriter class (__init__) and the methods for assigning and displaying variables within the assert statements could be relevant to identifying the source of the extra code line printing in error details. Given that this code deals directly with the rewriting of assertions and is precisely where the discrepancy in behavior might originate, it is identified as relevant.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the provided context, the identified spans in the src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py file are relevant to the issue. The spans include the initialization of the AssertionRewriter class, the method for visiting assert statements, and other related methods that handle the transformation of assert statements for detailed error reporting. These sections of code are central to how pytest handles and rewrites assert statements, particularly with respect to generating error messages, which directly addresses the issue of the extra code line being printed.",
