In 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py', the 'AssertionRewriter' class and its methods deal with rewriting assert statements to provide more informative failure messages.

Additionally, the 'AssertionRewriter' class in 'rewrite.py' is responsible for rewriting assertions using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). Changes in how decorators like 't' are handled, particularly in relation to line number calculations or AST processing, could be key. Since the issue appears in Python 3.9 but not in 3.7, it's crucial to compare AST handling and assertion rewriting mechanisms between these versions. Look for differences in Python's standard library or py._code that might explain the different behavior. Specifically, changes in 'ast' and how it processes decorators compared to previous versions could be revealing.",
