This behavior is not observed in Python 3.7. The provided search results include code spans from '_pytest/assertion' modules, which are directly relevant to assertion handling. Specifically, 'AssertionRewritingHook' and its methods in 'rewrite.py' appear to be central to the assertion rewriting process. The 'rewrite_asserts' function and the 'AssertionRewriter' class in 'rewrite.py' handle the rewriting of assertion statements, which is closely related to the issue at hand. Additionally, '_compare_eq_verbose' and '_compare_eq_iterable' functions in 'util.py' are also relevant as they handle comparison details in assertions.
