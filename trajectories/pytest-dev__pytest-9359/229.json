The key to solving this issue likely lies in understanding the difference in how Python 3.9 and 3.7 handle the assertion rewriting mechanism, which is a feature of pytest used to provide more detailed assertion failure messages. The code spans provided in the search results cover the implementation of pytest's assertion rewriting, with a focus on the AssertionRewriter class and its methods. These are crucial for understanding how assertions are rewritten and why the output might differ between Python versions. The 'visit_Assert' method in the AssertionRewriter class is particularly relevant as it handles the rewriting of the assert statements. Additionally, the 'pytest_runtest_protocol' and 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' hooks are also relevant as they are involved in the execution of tests and the generation of assertion comparison output, respectively. Overall, the provided code spans are pertinent to investigating the cause of the extra code line in the assertion error details for Python 3.9.",
