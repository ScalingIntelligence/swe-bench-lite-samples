Analyzing the reported issue, it appears that the user is experiencing an error message in pytest with Python 3.9 that prints an extra line of code (the 't' decorator) during assertion failures, which does not occur in Python 3.7. This suggests a potential issue with how pytest handles assertion rewriting or error reporting in Python 3.9.\n\n2. Reviewing the current file context, the focus is on `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py`, specifically the `pytest_runtest_protocol` and `pytest_assertrepr_compare` spans, which are central to pytest's assertion handling and error reporting.\n\n3. Processing new search results:\n   a. In `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods (`__init__`, `visit_Assert`) are highly relevant as they deal directly with rewriting assertion statements and handling their failure messages.\n   b. The `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` method contains logic for handling assert statements, including generating explanations for assertion failures and potentially handling the extra line issue due to decorator handling in Python 3.9.\n   c. The `src/_pytest/_code/code.py` file contains various utility functions and classes related to code representation and exception handling, but initially appears less directly relevant to the specific issue reported.\n\n4. Based on the analysis, the primary suspect is the `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, particularly how it processes assert statements and formats error messages, which might be affected by the presence of decorators in Python 3.9.",
