This discrepancy suggests an issue with how pytest handles assertion rewriting or error reporting in Python 3.9. The provided search results include the `AssertionRewriter` class from `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, which is responsible for rewriting assert statements before execution. This class contains methods for handling the rewriting and formatting of assert statements, which could be the source of the issue. Specifically, the `visit_Assert` method likely plays a crucial role in how assertion errors are handled and formatted. The code within this method deals with the logic to format error messages and decide what to include in the error output. Given the issue description, this method needs to be closely examined to understand if the behavior difference between Python versions is due to how this method or related methods are implemented or invoked.",

This behavior is different from Python 3.7, where the error message does not include the extra line. The key point of investigation is the AssertionRewriter class in the pytest codebase, as it handles the rewriting of assert statements for better error messages. The relevant code spans to focus on are those within the `visit_Assert` method of the AssertionRewriter class, which is where the assert statement is processed. Within this method, the code handles the creation of failure messages and the rewriting of assertions. It also checks for the enable_assertion_pass_hook, which could be a possible area of concern since it introduces additional complexity in handling assertions. The existing file context already points to this method, and the search results provide the full method along with other related methods in the AssertionRewriter class. It's crucial to review the logic that constructs the error message and how it interacts with the lineno information to ensure no extra code lines are included incorrectly. The review should focus on ensuring that the line number calculation and message construction are accurate, especially in the presence of decorators like 't' that might alter the code structure. The provided code spans offer a comprehensive view of the AssertionRewriter class, covering initialization, helper methods, and the main assertion handling logic, which aids in understanding the issue and verifying if the search task is complete.",
