This behavior is notably different from Python 3.7, where the extra line does not appear.\n2. The issue suggests a potential problem with how the line numbers for the assert statements are being calculated or processed in Python 3.9.\n3. The search results provided include two main files: `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`.\n4. In `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py`, the function `pytest_runtest_protocol` is responsible for handling the test run protocol and includes hooks for assertion comparison. This function could be relevant as it manages how assertions are processed and may affect the line number output.\n5. The other function, `pytest_assertrepr_compare`, is also in this file and directly handles the comparison of assertions, making it a potential candidate for the issue.\n6. In `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods are crucial as they handle the rewriting of assert statements. The method `visit_Assert` specifically deals with the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) manipulation of assert statements, which could directly influence how the line numbers are processed or displayed.\n7. The `AssertionRewriter` class initialization and the `visit_Assert` method are particularly relevant as they set up the environment for processing asserts and manage the transformation of assert statements into their rewritten form.\n8. From the analysis, the identified code spans in `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` are directly related to the processing and rewriting of assert statements, which aligns with the reported issue of extra code lines appearing in assertion errors. These spans likely contain the root cause or contributing factors to the reported issue.\n",
