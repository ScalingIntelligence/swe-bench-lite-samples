The provided context in the file `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` indicates that pytest handles assertion rewriting through the `AssertionRewriter` class, which visits `Assert` nodes in the AST. Notably, there's a contrast between handling assertions with and without the `enable_assertion_pass_hook`. It's crucial to identify if Python 3.9's changes in AST handling affect the `visit_Assert` method's behavior, specifically regarding how it deals with conditions and error messages. Since the decorator 't' might not be directly causing the issue, the search should focus on broader Python 3.9-specific changes that could impact assertion rewriting and pytest's handling of stack traces or line numbers during assertion failures.",
