The provided search results contain several code spans in the `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file that are relevant to assertion rewriting, which might be responsible for the observed behavior in Python 3.9 due to changes in how assertions are handled in this version compared to 3.7. Identified relevant spans are the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods, particularly `visit_Assert` which handles the rewriting of `assert` statements to provide more informative error messages. This method is particularly interesting as it has specific handling for the `pytest_assertion_pass_hook`, which might be related to the extra line issue noted in the reported issue. The `visit_Assert` method's handling of the `assert` statement's line number (`lineno`) and its creation of failure messages might be where the discrepancy arises between Python versions.
