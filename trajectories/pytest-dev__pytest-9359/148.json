There's an explicit handling of decorators within this method, but the impact of a custom decorator like `@t` on this process isn't directly addressed.

These are important for understanding how pytest handles assertions and might provide clues about the extra line printed in the error message.\n\nAdditionally, the 'AssertionRewriter' class in 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' is crucial as it deals with the rewriting of assert statements. The 'visit_Assert' method in this class processes the assert statements and constructs the failure messages. The logic within this method is relevant to the issue, especially where it handles the experimental 'pytest_assertion_pass' hook and constructs the assertion failure message.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the issue, the relevant code spans are in these specific parts of the codebase, which directly influence how assertions are handled and displayed during tests.",
