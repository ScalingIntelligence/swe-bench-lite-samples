Specifically, the spans in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` deal with rewriting assertions, which could be directly related to the issue of extra lines being printed.\n\nThe span `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py#AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert` is particularly relevant as it handles the rewriting of assert statements, and the code within this span includes logic for handling the negation of the assert condition and the creation of failure messages. This logic could potentially lead to the extra line being printed if not handled correctly. Additionally, the span `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py#pytest_runtest_protocol` also deals with assertion handling during the test run, which could be another point of interest.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue and the provided search results, these spans appear to be directly relevant to the reported problem.",
