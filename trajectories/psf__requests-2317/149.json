This seems to be a compatibility issue between Python 3.4 and the requests library version 2.4.3. Given the description, it's likely that the `builtin_str` function or similar in the `requests/sessions.py` file is involved in the conversion. Additionally, the `utils.safe_encode_list` in `python-neutronclient` might also be playing a role by converting the method to a binary string. The search should focus on `requests/sessions.py`, `requests/utils.py`, and any related functions or methods that handle the conversion of strings, especially those involving binary strings. The solution might involve adjusting how methods are handled in such conversions to ensure compatibility across different Python versions.",

This is in the `request` method of the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py`. It's clear that this command converts the method to a `builtin_str`, which could be causing the issue described. The additional `compat.py` file provides context on how `builtin_str` is defined differently for Python 2 and Python 3. Because the issue is specific to Python 3 usage, this suggests that the problem might be how `builtin_str` interacts with the rest of the code in a Python 3 environment, causing the method to become a literal string and not the expected type for HTTP methods. The context provided seems sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue.",
