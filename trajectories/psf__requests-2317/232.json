Specifically, a method is being converted from a binary string b'GET' to a literal string \"b'GET'\", which causes a 404 error. This problem seems to stem from the 'builtin_str' function acting unexpectedly in Python 3.4, potentially in the 'sessions.py' file. To address this, the search should focus on the 'sessions.py' file where the 'builtin_str' function is used to convert the method, and also look into the 'utils.py' file for the 'safe_encode_list' function, which might be involved in converting values to binary strings. Additionally, since the issue does not occur in Python 2.6, it could be beneficial to compare the handling of strings between these Python versions within the 'requests' library.",

The relevant code can be found in the `Session.request` method where `method = builtin_str(method)` is used to convert the method parameter. This conversion is problematic because it changes the binary string (b'GET') to a string representation (`\"b'GET'\"`), which is not the expected HTTP method by the server.
