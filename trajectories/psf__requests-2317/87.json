This likely occurs in the 'Session' class in 'requests/sessions.py' where the 'method' is being processed. Additionally, the 'utils.safe_encode_list(args)' command from python-neutronclient is mentioned as a potential culprit for converting values to binary strings. Therefore, the search should focus on the 'Session' class in 'sessions.py' and the 'safe_encode_list' function in 'utils.py'. Also, considering the difference between Python 2.6 and 3.4, it's worth checking how the 'method' variable is handled in different Python versions within the 'requests' library.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
