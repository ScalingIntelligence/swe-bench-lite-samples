The problem is likely rooted in the `requests/sessions.py` file where the `builtin_str` method is used. Given that the issue can arise from either neutronclient or requests, it's crucial to identify how `method` is handled and ensure it supports binary strings. Files to focus on include `requests/sessions.py`, `requests/utils.py` (particularly the `to_native_string` function), and `requests/adapters.py` for any handling involving the HTTP method. Additionally, examining `requests/models.py` for possible encoding issues and `requests/packages/urllib3/request.py` for method handling in lower-level HTTP operations may provide further insight.",

The issue arises because neutronclient uses 'args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)' which converts all values to binary strings, including the method. To address this, examining the code spans related to string conversion and method handling in the requests library is crucial.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of identifying relevant code spans:\n\n1. **Conversion of Strings**: The conversion function 'to_native_string' in requests/utils.py is examined. This function ensures the string is in the correct native format (either encoded or decoded based on Python version) and is essential for handling the conversion of the method.\n\n2. **Method Handling in HTTP Requests**: In requests/adapters.py, the 'send' method of the 'HTTPAdapter' class is reviewed. This method handles sending the request with the correct method. Ensuring the method is correctly processed here is crucial.\n\n3. **Request Preparation**: In requests/models.py, the 'PreparedRequest' class handles the preparation of the request, including setting the method and ensuring the URL is correctly formatted. This includes handling any potential issues with the method being a binary string.\n\nBy examining these specific areas, we can identify the relevant code spans that address the reported issue.",

The key focus is on the `method = builtin_str(method)` in `requests/sessions.py` and understanding how this conversion affects the request. We have already identified relevant code in `requests/utils.py` with the `to_native_string` function and in `requests/adapters.py` with the `HTTPAdapter` class and its `send` method. The newly provided search results in `requests/sessions.py` show the `Session` class and its `request` method where `method = builtin_str(method)` is used. This is directly related to the issue since it handles the conversion of the HTTP method. Additionally, `requests/models.py` contains the `PreparedRequest` class methods, which are crucial for understanding how the request is prepared and sent. Reviewing the entire sections of code within these spans, especially the `Session.request` and `PreparedRequest.prepare_method` methods, will help us understand if the code correctly handles the method conversion or if there's room for improvement to correctly process the method in its binary form if needed. This comprehensive review should provide enough context to decide if the current code can be adapted to better handle binary method strings or if additional changes are required.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
