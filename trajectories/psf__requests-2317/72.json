This problem is related to the handling of string types in Python 3.4 and the 'requests' library version 2.4.3. Specifically, the command `method = builtin_str(method)` in `requests/sessions.py` appears to be the source of the problem. Additionally, the `neutronclient` library uses a `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` command which converts all values to binary strings, including the method. Initial investigation suggests that focusing on the `sessions.py` file and the `builtin_str` function call within it might be a good starting point.",

This function is likely to be useful for solving the issue by ensuring the method is in the correct string format for the respective Python version. Additionally, the `compat.py` file contains version checks and type aliases that might be necessary for handling string types across different Python versions.

This leads to a 404 Not Found response when the method is used. The issue primarily involves Python 3.4 compatibility, as it does not occur in Python 2.6.\n\nFrom the given context, the `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` is pivotal, as it handles the conversion of strings to their native type. This function is likely where the binary to string conversion is happening.\n\nIn the new search results, the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` contains method definitions that handle HTTP requests. Notably, the `request` method calls `builtin_str(method)` on the method parameter, which is where the reported conversion issue likely occurs. This method is crucial for understanding how HTTP methods are processed and sent.\n\nThe `to_native_string` function is also present in the new search results, confirming its role in string conversion and its potential relevance to the issue. It's used in various parts of the `Session` class, particularly in handling redirects and preparing requests.\n\nGiven this context and the new search results, the `request` method in the `Session` class and the `to_native_string` function are key to addressing the reported issue, as they directly handle the conversion and processing of HTTP methods, including the method type causing the problem.",
