This problem is seen in Python 3.4, and the conversion seems to happen in the 'sessions.py' file of the 'requests' library. We should focus our search on the 'sessions.py' file and the 'utils.py' file, as the 'utils.safe_encode_list' function is mentioned in the issue. Additionally, we should look for the 'builtin_str' function, which is directly implicated in the issue. Given that this behavior is not seen in Python 2.6, it suggests an adaptation issue in Python 3.4 related to string handling. The search should concentrate on the conversion logic and how methods are being processed in Python 3.4.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
