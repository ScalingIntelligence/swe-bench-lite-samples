The problematic line is `method = builtin_str(method)` in `requests/sessions.py`. To resolve this, we need to identify where this conversion is happening and how it affects the method handling in the `requests` library. We should focus our search on files related to sessions and method handling, including `sessions.py`, `models.py`, and potentially `utils.py`.",

This line is responsible for converting the method from b'GET' to \"b'GET'\", which is no longer a binary string but a literal string, causing problems when used by the requests library. This conversion happens in the 'request' method of the 'Session' class. Since the issue mentions a problem with binary strings, it is crucial to identify code spans that deal with string conversions and HTTP methods.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
