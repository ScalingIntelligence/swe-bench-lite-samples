This conversion causes the method to become \"b'GET'\" instead of the expected 'GET', leading to a 404 error. The problem seems to stem from `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` in `neutronclient`, which encodes all values, including the method, into binary strings. This is not handled correctly by the `requests` library, especially when using Python 3.4. The search should focus on the `requests/sessions.py` file for the conversion logic and potentially `requests/utils.py` for the encoding utility function.",
