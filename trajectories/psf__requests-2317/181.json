This problem is specific to Python 3.4 and seems to be related to how the method is handled in the sessions module. The neutronclient's 'utils.safe_encode_list' command converts values to binary strings, including the method. To resolve this, we need to identify where the method is being converted and potentially how it's being used in the requests library, focusing on the sessions.py file.",

The provided search results contain a section of the 'requests' library's codebase, specifically from 'requests/sessions.py'. The relevant code spans are identified as follows: 1. The 'request' method where 'method = builtin_str(method)' occurs, potentially causing the issue. 2. The entire 'Session' class implementation, as it contains methods related to sending requests, handling redirects, and managing settings, which are all contextually relevant to the issue.
