Investigating the requests/sessions.py file and looking for the `builtin_str` usage or similar conversions is a good starting point.

According to the report, this conversion is causing a 404 Not Found error when using the 'requests' library with specific versions of Python and the 'neutronclient'. The problem occurs because the 'method' value, after conversion, becomes a literal string (e.g., \"b'GET'\") instead of the intended binary string ('b'GET''). This misconversion seems to be critical as it leads to the erroneous HTTP request method being used. The relevant section of the code where this conversion takes place is in the `Session.request` method where `method = builtin_str(method)` is explicitly called. As per the reported issue, this behavior is not observed in Python 2.6, indicating a potential difference in string handling between Python 2 and Python 3 versions. Given the nature of the issue and the reported context, the `Session.request` method in the `requests/sessions.py` file is the primary focus, as it directly involves the line responsible for the problematic conversion.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
