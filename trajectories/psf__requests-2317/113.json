The 'method' parameter, which should be converted from a binary string to a regular string, seems to be incorrectly converted to a literal string representation, causing a 404 error. This issue appears to be exacerbated by the usage of the 'utils.safe_encode_list' function in the python-neutronclient library, which converts all values, including the method, to binary strings. To address this, we should search for the specific code snippet where the 'method' parameter is being processed and converted, focusing on the 'sessions.py' file within the 'requests' library.",

The provided search results include the `Session` class definition and the `request` method within the `Session` class. The `request` method uses `builtin_str(method)` to convert the method to a string. This conversion seems to be the root cause of the problem reported, as the method gets converted to a literal string representation of the binary string, causing issues downstream. This directly matches the reported issue, where the method conversion is leading to a 404 error when used, especially in Python 3.4. Therefore, the identified code span in the `request` method within the `Session` class is relevant to the reported issue. No other search results were provided, so there is no additional context to consider.
