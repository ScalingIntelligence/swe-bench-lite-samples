The provided search results include relevant code spans in 'requests/sessions.py' and 'requests/utils.py' which are potentially related to this issue.\n\nIn 'requests/sessions.py', the 'request' method is of particular interest as it directly handles the 'method' parameter.

Understanding how and why this conversion happens is crucial to identifying the root cause.\n\nAdditionally, in 'requests/utils.py', the 'to_native_string' function also deals with string encodings and conversions. Despite not being explicitly called in the 'request' method, it's possible that this utility function or similar ones are used elsewhere in the codebase to handle string conversions, including those related to the 'method' parameter.\n\nGiven these findings, the code spans identified from 'requests/sessions.py' are directly related to the reported issue.
