The problematic conversion happens in `requests/sessions.py` where `method = builtin_str(method)` is used. This transformation causes the method to become a literal string representation of the binary, leading to a 404 error when the method is used. The problem does not occur in Python 2.6, suggesting a difference in string handling between Python versions. Investigating the `requests` library's handling of method strings and its compatibility with binary strings in Python 3.4 is crucial. Additionally, examining how `neutronclient` handles and encodes method strings might also be necessary.",

The search results provide relevant sections of the code from `requests/sessions.py` where the `request` method is defined, and within this method, the `builtin_str` function is used to convert the `method` parameter.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
