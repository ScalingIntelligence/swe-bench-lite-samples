This conversion causes the method to become `\"b'GET'\"` instead of `'GET'`, leading to a 404 Not Found response. Given the context and the search results, it appears that the issue could be related to how `builtin_str` is defined and used in the codebase, particularly in relation to Python 2 vs. Python 3 compatibility. The `requests/compat.py` file contains definitions for `builtin_str` that differ based on the Python version, which might be contributing to the problem. Additionally, the `requests/packages/chardet/compat.py` file also has compatibility code for handling string types, but it does not directly address the `builtin_str` issue. The `requests/sessions.py` file already contains the problematic line `method = builtin_str(method)` within the `Session.request` method, which aligns with the reported issue. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans in `requests/sessions.py` and `requests/compat.py` are relevant to the reported issue as they directly involve the `builtin_str` function which is the core of the problem described.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
