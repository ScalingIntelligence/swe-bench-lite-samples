This conversion is done in the `Session.request` method of `requests/sessions.py`, where `method = builtin_str(method)` is executed. This method is responsible for making HTTP requests and preparing them. The problem arises because after conversion, the method `b'GET'` becomes `'b'GET''`, which is not an expected HTTP method and results in a 404 error. This suggests that the issue is with how `builtin_str` is handling the conversion of binary strings in Python 3. The relevant code spans to look at are those where `builtin_str` is defined and used, particularly in the context of handling HTTP methods. The `builtin_str` function is imported from `requests/compat.py`, and it's used in several places to handle string conversions, including in the `Session.request` method. Additional relevant code spans include the definition of `RequestEncodingMixin._encode_params`, which also deals with encoding data for HTTP requests, and `to_native_string` in `requests/utils.py`, which is related to string conversion. Examining these areas should provide a comprehensive understanding of how string conversions are handled and where the conversion might be failing, leading to the reported issue.",

To locate the exact point of failure resulting in the 404 Not Found response, we should focus our search on how the 'Session.request' method processes the 'method' variable after its conversion by 'builtin_str' in 'requests/sessions.py'. Additionally, we should continue to search for the implementation of 'utils.safe_encode_list' to understand how it transforms values into binary strings, which may also be relevant to the issue.

This transformation is causing a 404 Not Found response because the method is no longer recognized as a valid HTTP method by the server. The relevant part of the issue is the line `method = builtin_str(method)` in `Session.request` method. This indicates a potential bug in handling binary strings in the `requests` library. Steps taken to identify relevant code spans:\n1. Analyzed `Session.request` method in `requests/sessions.py` where the problematic line `method = builtin_str(method)` resides.\n2. Examined `builtin_str` function definition in `requests/compat.py` to understand how it converts strings, which involves checking the Python version and handling accordingly.\n3. Reviewed `requests/utils.py` for any utility functions related to string handling, found `to_native_string` which also deals with string conversions.\n4. Considered the broader context of string handling in `requests/models.py` especially within `RequestEncodingMixin` class to ensure a comprehensive understanding of how strings are processed throughout the library.\n5. Assessed additional files like `requests/__init__.py` and `requests/packages/__init__.py` to understand the overall structure and other potential dependencies.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are still relevant to the issue and provide a comprehensive view of string handling in the `requests` library.",

Specifically, it points out that the method builtin_str(method) in `sessions.py` is converting the binary string 'b'GET'' to a literal string, causing a 404 error. This problem arises due to a combination of Python 3.4 and the use of python-neutronclient with requests. The key focus here is the incorrect handling of the method field when it's in binary form. The analysis of the file context highlights that method is being processed in multiple functions within `sessions.py` such as 'Session.request', 'Session.prepare_request', and 'SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects'. The search results provide related sections where methods such as 'to_native_string', '_encode_params', '_encode_files', and 'prepare_auth' are used, which could be part of the solution or could be used to further debug the issue. The search task is complete as all pertinent sections of the codebase related to the handling and processing of the method parameter and its conversion have been identified, including surrounding utilities and contextual setup within sessions.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
