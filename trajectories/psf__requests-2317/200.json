The problem is likely rooted in the conversion logic within the 'requests' package, particularly in the 'sessions.py' file where the transformation occurs. An additional angle could be the 'utils.safe_encode_list' function in 'neutronclient' which converts values to binary strings, possibly interacting poorly with the 'requests' package. A targeted search should include finding the exact location of the 'builtin_str(method)' usage and checking if 'requests' handles binary method strings correctly.",

This conversion is done using the `builtin_str(method)` command, which is causing a 404 Not Found response when the method is used. The issue is particularly problematic in Python 3.4, where such conversions are not handled correctly as they were in Python 2.6. The search results provided include relevant code spans from the `requests/sessions.py` and `requests/compat.py` files. Specifically, the `requests/sessions.py` file contains the implementation of the `Session` class, which includes the `request` method where `builtin_str(method)` is used to convert the HTTP method. Additionally, the `requests/compat.py` file includes the definition of `builtin_str` which maps to `str` in Python 3, further emphasizing the relevance of this conversion to the reported issue. These code spans are directly related to the conversion of method types and how they are handled in different Python versions, making them highly relevant to the reported issue.",
