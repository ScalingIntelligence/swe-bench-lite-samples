This causes a 404 Not Found response when used in neutronclient with python3.4. The key area to investigate is the conversion process within the requests library, especially in the sessions.py file and related utility functions where such conversions might occur. Additionally, understanding how these conversions are handled differently between Python versions, particularly between 2.6 and 3.4, is crucial.",

The primary focus is on the 'builtin_str(method)' function used in the 'request' method within 'requests/sessions.py'. This function converts the method from a binary string to a literal string, which is causing the problem. I have identified the relevant section in 'requests/sessions.py' where this conversion happens. Additionally, I have noted the 'Request' and 'PreparedRequest' classes in 'requests/models.py' as they handle the request method and might be affected indirectly by this issue. Furthermore, the 'api.py' file might also be relevant as it contains the high-level request methods (get, post, etc.) that ultimately call the 'Session.request' method, which is where the issue originates.",

This conversion is problematic when the `method` is expected to be a binary string, causing a 404 error. The main focus is on the `Session.request` method in `sessions.py`, which currently performs this conversion. The search results include relevant sections from `requests/compat.py`, `requests/sessions.py`, and `requests/utils.py`. The `builtin_str` function is found in `compat.py`, which explains the conversion logic between Python 2 and 3 string types. The `to_native_string` function in `utils.py` also handles string conversions but differs in functionality by encoding or decoding based on the Python version. Given the context, the identified spans related to `builtin_str` and string conversion are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
