The problem arises when the method is converted from b'GET' to \"b'GET'\", which results in a 404 error. This suggests that the handling of method strings in requests might need adjustment to better accommodate binary strings. Given the context provided, it would be beneficial to first investigate the conversion functions and utilities within the requests library that might be responsible for this transformation. Specifically, the `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` and the `prepare_method` function in `requests/models.py` should be inspected for potential issues.",
