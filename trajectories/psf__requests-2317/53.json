This seems to be related to differences between Python 2.6 and 3.4. The focus should be on the 'requests/sessions.py' file and the 'builtin_str' function used there. Additionally, looking into how the method parameter is handled throughout the library, considering files like 'requests/models.py' and 'requests/utils.py', might provide insights into a potential fix or workaround.",
