The line `method = builtin_str(method)` in `requests/sessions.py` is converting a binary string `b'GET'` to a literal string `\"b'GET'\"`, which is causing a 404 error when used in requests. This seems to be influenced by a command in `python-neutronclient` that converts values to binary strings, including the method. To resolve this, it's crucial to identify how the method is being processed and possibly how it could be better handled in the 'requests' library.",
