The problem arises specifically in the `requests/sessions.py` file where the method is converted from a binary string (`b'GET'`) to a literal string (`'b'GET''`), resulting in a 404 error when the method is used. This conversion is happening through the `builtin_str` function. Additionally, the issue seems to be exacerbated by the `utils.safe_encode_list` command in the `neutronclient`, which converts all values, including the method, to binary strings. Given the context, the focus should be on finding the specific conversion and handling of the method in the `requests` module, particularly in the `requests/sessions.py` file. It's also worth investigating the `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` as it might be involved in handling string conversions. To troubleshoot further, the exact location of the `builtin_str` function call and the `to_native_string` function would be beneficial.",

The analysis points to the usage of 'builtin_str(method)' in requests/sessions.py as a potential culprit, as it changes the method from 'b'GET'' to \"b'GET'\" due to differences between Python 2.6 and 3.4. This transformation is not a binary string but a literal string representation of it, which can affect HTTP request methods. Considering the user's environment and the stated issue, focusing on the 'requests/sessions.py' file, particularly at the 'Session' class and its 'request' method, is crucial. Within 'Session.request', 'method = builtin_str(method)' directly impacts the method type sent in the request. Also, the relevant tools or functions that may have introduced this issue in the first place, such as 'utils.safe_encode_list' in neutronclient, although not directly found here, could be affecting input types at a higher level. Given that 'requests/utils.py' also uses 'builtin_str' via 'to_native_string', it's indirectly relevant to the issue and should be noted as part of the broader context of conversions in the requests module.",
