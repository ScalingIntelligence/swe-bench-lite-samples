This issue seems to be triggered when `neutronclient` uses a command to convert values to binary strings, including the method. The problem is specific to Python 3.4 and not present in Python 2.6.\n\nThe primary focus of the search is to identify where and how the `method` is being processed and potentially misinterpreted in the `requests` library. Upon examining the search results from `requests/sessions.py`, the relevant code span appears to be within the `Session.request` method, where `method = builtin_str(method)` is explicitly called. This is the direct point of conversion from binary to string, which aligns with the reported issue. Therefore, this code span is highly relevant to the problem at hand.\n\nGiven the context and the specific issue, this code span within the `request` method is the main area of interest. It's where the method parameter is being processed, and it's likely the source of the problem described in the issue. Further investigation or modification to this part of the code may be necessary to handle binary strings appropriately and avoid conversion to literal string representations that lead to 404 errors.",

The issue arises because `builtin_str` converts binary strings inappropriately in Python 3.4, causing a problem when the method string is used in a subsequent request. To better understand the nature of the issue, we should examine the `compat.py` file where `builtin_str` is defined. In `compat.py`, we find that `builtin_str` is simply the built-in `str` function, but the file includes specific handling for compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3. Since binary strings behave differently in Python 2 and Python 3, this discrepancy could be the source of the problem. Given this information and the earlier mention of the `compat.py` file, it might be beneficial to look deeper into the handling of binary strings in that file and potentially test different scenarios in both Python 2.6 and Python 3.4 to identify discrepancies in handling binary strings.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
