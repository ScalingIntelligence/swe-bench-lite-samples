To further investigate and potentially resolve this, we could look into how 'builtin_str' is defined and used within the 'requests' library, especially concerning binary strings in Python 3.4.

Specifically, the method 'method = builtin_str(method)' in requests/sessions.py is causing the binary string 'b'GET'' to be converted to the literal string \"b'GET'\", which causes a 404 error when used in HTTP requests. This problem is exacerbated by the python-neutronclient's use of 'utils.safe_encode_list', which converts all values, including the method, to binary strings. The issue does not occur in Python 2.6 but is problematic in Python 3.4. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the conversion of method strings and potentially other related utilities. The provided search results include the definition of 'builtin_str' in 'requests/compat.py', which indicates how this function behaves differently between Python 2 and Python 3. Additionally, there are several spans in 'requests/models.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/request.py' that deal with HTTP methods and encoding, which may need to be adjusted or better handle the binary strings. The provided 'requests/sessions.py' file already contains the problematic line 'method = builtin_str(method)', which needs to be reviewed to ensure that HTTP methods are correctly handled without being turned into literal strings.",
