To address this, we should investigate the use of `builtin_str` and how it converts binary strings, as well as the handling of method values and binary strings in the requests library. It may also be relevant to look into the `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` function used in neutronclient to understand how it interacts with the requests library.",
