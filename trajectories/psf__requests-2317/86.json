Specifically, the problematic conversion occurs in 'requests/sessions.py' with the command 'method = builtin_str(method)', which converts the method from a binary string to a literal string representation. This causes issues when the method is subsequently used, leading to a 404 Not Found response. The user also mentions that the 'neutronclient' library uses 'utils.safe_encode_list(args)', which converts all values, including the method, to binary strings. There's a suggestion that if 'requests' handled binary strings for method values, the issue would not occur. From the search results, two key areas are relevant: the definition of 'Session' and 'session()' in 'requests/sessions.py', and the 'to_native_string' function in 'requests/utils.py'. The 'to_native_string' function specifically deals with converting strings to native string types, which might be related to the conversion issue described. It's unclear from the provided search results if the actual problematic code span ('method = builtin_str(method)') is present, but these areas are likely relevant to addressing the issue.",
