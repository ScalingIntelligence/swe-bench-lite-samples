The method is being converted from b'GET' to \"b'GET'\", which is now a literal string instead of a binary string. This conversion seems to be happening in the `requests/sessions.py` file at the line `method = builtin_str(method)`. Internally, requests might be expecting a binary string for the method, leading to the error. The solution could involve modifying how the method string is handled within the requests library or adjusting how binary strings are processed in the neutronclient library. The search should focus on identifying the areas in the requests library that process or convert HTTP methods to investigate potential fixes.",

This conversion causes issues when the 'method' parameter is used in HTTP requests, resulting in a '404 Not Found' response. The search results provide insights into how the 'method' parameter is handled in the 'requests' library. The relevant files and code spans include 'requests/models.py' where the 'Request' class and its 'prepare' method are defined. This method prepares the request by setting the 'method' attribute. Additionally, 'requests/api.py' contains the higher-level 'request' function that calls the 'session.request' method, indicating how the 'method' parameter is propagated through the library. Given the search results, it appears that the core handling of the 'method' parameter is captured in these spans, but further investigation may be needed to determine if the 'method' parameter handling correctly accommodates binary strings.",

This is the exact line identified in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code span is the method 'Session.request'.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
