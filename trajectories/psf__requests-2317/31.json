The relevant code spans appear to be in the 'Session.request' method in requests/sessions.py where the problematic conversion 'method = builtin_str(method)' occurs. Additionally, the 'to_native_string' function in requests/utils.py also deals with string conversion, though it is not directly causing the issue. The code in urllib3/request.py does not appear to be directly related to the issue at hand.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
