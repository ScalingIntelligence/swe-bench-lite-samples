This problem is compounded by the neutronclient's 'utils.safe_encode_list(args)' command converting all values, including the method, into binary strings. This suggests a deeper look into how 'requests' handles method values when they are binary strings, and specific functions or methods involved in this process within the requests library. Additionally, understanding the differences in string handling between python2.6 and python3.4 might provide a path to resolution. Focusing on the 'requests' module and specific classes and functions that handle HTTP methods and string encoding, such as 'Session', 'PreparedRequest', and utility functions like 'to_native_string' in 'requests/utils.py', is crucial.",

The issue occurs in Python 3.4 when the `method` variable, which is a binary string, is converted by `builtin_str` in `requests/sessions.py`, resulting in a literal string representation of the binary data. This causes requests to receive a 404 Not Found response when the method is used.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in `requests/sessions.py` and `requests/utils.py`. In `requests/sessions.py`, the `Session.request` method directly involves the conversion of the `method` variable using `builtin_str`. This is a critical part of the code to address the issue. Additionally, the `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` is also relevant as it deals with converting strings to native types, which might interact with the `builtin_str` function.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans should include the parts of the `request` method in `requests/sessions.py` that handle the `method` variable and the `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py`.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
