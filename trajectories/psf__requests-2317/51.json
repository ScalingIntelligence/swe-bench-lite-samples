This problem seems to be specific to Python 3.4 and might be related to how the method is being encoded or handled in the request preparation or sending process. We should focus our search on files and functions that are involved in encoding, preparing, or sending the request, specifically looking for instances where the 'method' parameter is handled. Given the context, 'builtin_str(method)' is a key piece of information to look for, as it is the function causing the issue by converting the method from a binary string to a literal string. Additionally, we should explore functions and classes in the 'sessions.py' and 'utils.py' files, as they are likely to be involved in the request handling and encoding processes.",
