This causes a `404 Not Found` response when the method is used. The problem is likely caused by the combination of Python 3.4, python-neutronclient (2.3.9), and requests (2.4.3). It is unclear whether the bug lies in neutronclient or requests, but investigating how requests handle the method as a binary string might provide clarity. Additionally, neutronclient's use of `utils.safe_encode_list` could be a contributing factor. Given the file context, the immediate focus should be on the sessions.py file and related utilities that handle method encoding, including compat.py, utils.py, and possibly adapters.py which could handle HTTP methods.",

I focused on the code in 'requests/models.py' because it contains the 'PreparedRequest' class which is likely involved in preparing the request method. Specifically, the 'prepare_headers' and 'prepare_body' methods caught my attention as they handle aspects of the request likely affected by this issue. However, I did not find direct handling of the 'method' variable in these methods. Despite this, the code within these methods shows how header and body data are prepared, which can inform a potential fix for handling binary strings better within 'requests', particularly around the 'Content-Length' header. Additionally, the 'compatible.py' file provides insight into how the library handles string types across different Python versions, which could be useful context for understanding the broader issue and potential solutions. Reviewing the entire code in sections, including imports and related functions or classes, aids in understanding the broader context, which led to the selection of these spans as relevant to the issue reported.",

The search results should focus on identifying where the method is being converted using builtin_str and how it interacts with the rest of the library. We also need to ensure that any relevant parts of the code handling the method or converting strings are included. The search results do not directly address the issue of the binary string conversion, but there are relevant sections such as 'Session.request' which uses builtin_str(method) and could be modified to handle binary strings more gracefully. Additionally, the 'RequestEncodingMixin' section in models.py provides insight into how data and files are encoded, which might interact indirectly with the method issue.",
