Specifically, the method `method = builtin_str(method)` in `requests/sessions.py`, which converts a binary string to a literal string representation, causing a '404 Not Found' error. To resolve this, we need to identify and revise the function `builtin_str` or any related conversion logic that might be responsible for this behavior, potentially in the `requests/utils.py` file given the `to_native_string` utility. Additionally, the `requests/compat.py` file should be checked for any Python version-specific adaptations that might be relevant.",
