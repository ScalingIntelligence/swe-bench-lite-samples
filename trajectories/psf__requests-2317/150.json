The problem seems to be related to the `method = builtin_str(method)` line in the `requests/sessions.py` file. This functionality appears to be affected by differences between Python versions, as the issue does not occur in Python 2.6. To address this issue, it would be beneficial to locate the `builtin_str` function and the specific implementation of how the method handling is done in the `requests` library under Python 3.4. Also, it's important to investigate how the `utils.safe_encode_list` function in `python-neutronclient` affects this process.",

This leads to issues when the method is used in HTTP requests, resulting in a 404 response. The provided search results include relevant sections of code from 'requests/models.py' and 'requests/utils.py'. In 'models.py', the 'RequestEncodingMixin' class and its methods deal with encoding data and files, potentially handling the method in question. The 'to_native_string' function in 'utils.py' is also relevant as it directly deals with converting strings to native strings, which could be where the conversion issue occurs. Furthermore, the 'PreparedRequest' class in 'models.py' handles the preparation of requests, including the method, which suggests it's a crucial part of where the method conversion might influence the request outcome. All these sections are directly related to how the method is handled and could influence the issue described. Additionally, the 'Request' class initialization is relevant as it sets up the method attribute which could be passed through problematic conversions before the request is made.",

The `to_native_string` function is used to convert strings to the native string type of the Python environment, which could affect how HTTP methods are handled if they are in binary form. Since the `method = builtin_str(method)` conversion is specifically affecting HTTP methods, it's worth investigating further within the `requests` library, focusing on any utilities related to string handling and HTTP method processing. Additionally, considering the dependencies like `neutronclient` and its `utils.safe_encode_list` method, which might convert methods to binary strings, could also be a source of the problem. However, the immediate focus should be on improving handling of binary strings in the HTTP method context within the `requests` library itself.",

The focus is on identifying the relevant code spans in the `requests` library that handle the conversion and processing of the method parameter to ensure it can handle binary strings properly. Additionally, the search results should include any utility functions involved in string processing, such as `to_native_string`. The current file context includes relevant spans in `requests/models.py` and `requests/utils.py`, such as `to_native_string`. The new search results provide further context in `requests/utils.py`, `requests/models.py`, and `requests/compat.py`, particularly the `to_native_string` function and its usage in `PreparedRequest.prepare_headers` and `PreparedRequest.prepare_body`. These spans are relevant as they directly deal with string conversion and handling in HTTP requests. The identified spans are consistent with the reported issue and the current file context, indicating they are relevant for addressing the method conversion problem.",

This conversion is causing a 404 Not Found response when the method is used by the requests library. The problem seems to stem from the safe_encode_list method in neutronclient, which converts all values, including the method, to binary strings. The goal is to identify code spans relevant to handling this conversion and potential fixes. The provided search results include several files and spans from the requests library, including sessions.py, models.py, and utils.py. In the context of the reported issue, the focus should be on the handling of method conversion and the involvement of the to_native_string function. Additionally, it's important to review how binary strings are processed and potentially modified within the requests lifecycle. The Session class in sessions.py processes the request method using builtin_str(method), which may be where the incorrect conversion occurs. Further examination of the code around this conversion and checks for binary strings being processed as method values are necessary.",
