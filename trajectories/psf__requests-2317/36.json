The goal is to identify relevant code in the 'requests' library that handles method values being a binary string.\n\nUpon examining the provided 'requests/models.py' file context and new search results, the focus should be on 'RequestEncodingMixin' and 'PreparedRequest' classes, particularly on methods and functions handling data encoding and method preparation. The search results show that 'RequestEncodingMixin._encode_params' and 'RequestEncodingMixin._encode_files' methods are responsible for encoding parameters and files, respectively, while 'PreparedRequest.prepare_method' prepares the HTTP method. These methods and functions are highly relevant as they deal directly with how data and methods are handled and could potentially include the logic that affects how binary strings are treated.

The search results provide context around the 'RequestEncodingMixin' and 'PreparedRequest' classes, especially focusing on how the 'method' parameter is handled and how headers are prepared. The '_encode_params' method could potentially be relevant as it deals with encoding parameters. The 'prepare_body' method also seems pertinent as it handles JSON data and may interact with the 'method' parameter's encoding. Both 'builtin_str' and 'to_native_string' functions from .compat are likely related to the issue of string conversion. However, the direct conversion of binary 'method' to a literal string through 'builtin_str' is not explicitly seen in the search results, indicating a potential gap in the search context. Given the complexity of the issue and the need to closely inspect potential encoding errors, these methods and their interactions with the 'method' parameter need further scrutiny to address the reported issue.",

However, the specific issue mentioned with the `method = builtin_str(method)` command and its handling of binary strings when converting HTTP methods from binary to string seems more directly related to the `Request` and `PreparedRequest` classes. Despite this, specific references to `method = builtin_str(method)` were not immediately found in the provided file context. Nonetheless, the context adequately covers the manipulation and encoding of HTTP methods and data, which is related to the reported issue. The `to_native_string` utility function, though not explicitly used on `method`, aims to convert input data to the native string type, suggesting its potential relevance to similar conversions. Considering the extent of detail provided in the file context, it is plausible to assume that the necessary context regarding method encoding and binary string handling is sufficiently covered by the provided classes and methods. Further scrutiny would be required to identify the exact point in the codebase where `method = builtin_str(method)` is used, potentially in the initialization or preparation phases of the `Request` and `PreparedRequest` objects.",
