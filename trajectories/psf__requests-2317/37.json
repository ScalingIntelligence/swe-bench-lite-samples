This affects the Python-NeutronClient library, especially when using the 'utils.safe_encode_list(args)' command, which converts values to binary strings including the method. Since the problem does not occur in Python 2.6, the focus should be on the differences in string handling between Python 2.6 and Python 3.4. The search should target the 'requests/sessions.py' file and the 'utils.safe_encode_list' command, along with any other relevant functions or classes involved in string conversion or handling within the 'requests' library. Additionally, the 'requests/utils.py' file should be checked for any utility functions involved in string encoding or conversion.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about a problem with the conversion of a binary string to a string when using the `requests` library in Python 3.4, specifically around the `method = builtin_str(method)` command in `requests/sessions.py`. This conversion seems to be causing the method to become a literal string rather than just the string representation of the method, leading to a 404 error. Additionally, there's a mention of `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` in `neutronclient` that's converting values to binary strings, including the method, which is problematic when used with `requests`. The user is also pointing out a difference in behavior between Python 2.6 and 3.4 that's causing issues.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, it's evident that the issue revolves around the `Session.request` method in `requests/sessions.py` where `method = builtin_str(method)` is used. This code span is directly related to the reported problem as it is the place where the method is being converted and potentially causing the 404 error. Additionally, the `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` could be related, as it also deals with string conversion and could be used in handling the method or other parts of the request. However, it's primarily the `Session.request` method that is directly causing the issue, so it should be the focus of the initial fix.\n\nI recommend examining and potentially modifying the `Session.request` method to handle the conversion in a way that does not cause the method to become a literal string, perhaps by ensuring the method is not enclosed in extra quotes. The `to_native_string` function might also need to be reviewed if it's being used elsewhere in the chain to ensure it's not causing similar issues in different parts of the codebase.",

  "initial_message": "method = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
