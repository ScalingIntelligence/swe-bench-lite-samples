The problem seems to be related to how the method is handled in the sessions.py file, where `method = builtin_str(method)` converts the binary string `b'GET'` to the literal `\"b'GET'\"`. This transformation seems to be a compatibility issue between Python 2.6 and Python 3.4, causing trouble when neutronclient (2.3.9) calls the `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` function, which encodes method values to binary strings. The solution might involve adjusting how the method is handled in sessions.py or the neutronclient utils to ensure compatibility across different Python versions.",

  "initial_message": "method = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
