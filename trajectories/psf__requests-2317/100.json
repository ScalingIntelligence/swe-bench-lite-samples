The problem seems to be that when requests tries to use the method as a literal string 'b'GET'', it gets a 404 error. This could be due to a mismatch between Python 2 and Python 3 string handling.

The problem occurs when the converted string is used by the requests library, causing a 404 Not Found response. The user suspects that handling the method value as a binary string might resolve the issue. The relevant code spans are found in requests/sessions.py and requests/models.py, where the Session.request method converts the method to a builtin_str and the PreparedRequest.prepare_body method prepares the body of the request. These code spans directly involve the conversion and handling of the method, which are central to the reported issue. Additionally, the compat.py file also contains relevant definitions for the builtin_str method, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of the conversion across different Python versions.

This method is critical for understanding how the request method is being handled before sending.

The search results confirm the presence of the relevant code spans in both files, especially focusing on the `Session.request` and `PreparedRequest.prepare_body` methods.

The use of 'builtin_str' in the 'request' method converts the method to a string, which aligns with the issue description. Additionally, the 'prepare_body' method handles how the body of the request is prepared, which could potentially interact with the method type.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
