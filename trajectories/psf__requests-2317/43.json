The problem seems to stem from the `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` command in neutronclient, which converts the method to a binary string. The main focus should be on the `requests/sessions.py` file where the conversion `method = builtin_str(method)` occurs. Additionally, investigating the `utils.py` file within the requests library to understand if there are other conversions that might inadvertently affect the method type could be beneficial. The goal is to identify places where binary strings might be converted to a literal string format and ensure they are handled appropriately without causing unintended side effects.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
