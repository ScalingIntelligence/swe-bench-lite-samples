This conversion causes a 404 Not Found response when the method is used. It's likely that the problem stems from how the method is being encoded or prepared for use in the HTTP request. Focusing on the `requests` package, specifically `sessions.py` and related files like `utils.py`, `models.py`, and `adapters.py`, might lead to finding the root cause. Additionally, since Python 3.4 is involved, and the issue doesn't appear in Python 2.6, discrepancies in string handling between versions could be pointed out. ",

Since the issue is in Python 3.4 and specific to the conversion from binary to string, the relevant code spans should focus on where the conversion occurs and how the request is being processed after this conversion.\n\nThe code spans from 'requests/sessions.py' are crucial, especially the 'Session.request' method where 'method = builtin_str(method)' is explicitly used to convert the method type. Additionally, the 'Session.send' method should be reviewed to see how the converted method is being used in the subsequent request process. The 'PreparedRequest' class in 'requests/models.py' could also be relevant to see how the request method is handled after conversion during the preparation for sending.\n\nMoreover, considering the issue arises specifically in a Python 3 environment, it's important to see how certain strings or binary data are handled differently from Python 2, as indicated by the software versions mentioned (Python3.4, python-neutronclient 2.3.9, requests 2.4.3).",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
