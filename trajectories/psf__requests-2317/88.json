This problem seems to be specific to Python 3.4 and the interaction between python-neutronclient and requests. The error occurs because the method is being converted from a binary string to a literal string representation, causing requests to fail. Investigating the `builtin_str` function and how it handles binary strings, as well as the `safe_encode_list` function in the `utils` module, is crucial. Additionally, looking into how the `RequestEncodingMixin` class and its methods handle binary strings is important.",

Additionally, reviewing the code around the conversion process and the handling of method types in the RequestEncodingMixin class in requests/models.py could help identify if there are other areas influencing this issue.
