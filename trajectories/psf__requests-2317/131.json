This problem is active in Python 3.4 but not in Python 2.6, indicating a difference in handling binary and string types between these versions. The relevant code snippet provided is `method = builtin_str(method)`, which suggests focusing the search on how `builtin_str` is defined or imported in the `requests` library. Additionally, investigating how methods are handled or interpreted in the `RequestEncodingMixin`, `Session`, and possibly `RequestMethods` classes might also be beneficial.",

The problem is specifically mentioned in the context of `requests/sessions.py` where the `method = builtin_str(method)` conversion is done. This conversion is problematic because it alters the intended type of the method variable from binary to a literal string representation of the binary string. This discrepancy is causing compatibility issues between Python 2.6 and 3.4. This issue also affects the `neutronclient` when using `utils.safe_encode_list`, which converts all values to binary strings, including the method. Given this context, the relevant code spans should focus on the handling and conversion of the method variable within the `requests` library, particularly in the `sessions.py` file. Additionally, examining how other parts of the library, like `RequestMethods` and `RequestEncodingMixin`, handle method encoding might also be relevant to understand the scope and potential solutions for this issue. Upon reviewing the provided search results, it's clear that the `requests/sessions.py` file contains the relevant code span where the method conversion occurs, specifically within the `Session.request` method. Furthermore, the `RequestMethods` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/request.py` contains methods that handle different HTTP methods, which could also be relevant to understand how methods are processed. The inclusion of these code spans provides a comprehensive view of where the direct action is taken on the method variable and how different HTTP methods are managed within the requests library.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
