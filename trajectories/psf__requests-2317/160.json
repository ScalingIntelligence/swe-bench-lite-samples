The issue seems to be with the builtin_str function or how the method is being handled before it reaches the request function. In the provided search results, the relevant code spans are in requests/sessions.py where the method is being converted using builtin_str in the request function. Also, the to_native_string function in requests/utils.py is relevant as it also deals with string conversion and might be a suitable place to implement a fix if builtin_str is not being handled correctly in Python 3.4.",
