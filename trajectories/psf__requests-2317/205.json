Specifically, the problem arises when the binary string representation of a method (like b'GET') is converted to a literal string representation ('b\\'GET\\''), causing a 404 error. Given the context provided, the root of the problem seems to be in how requests handles the method string after conversion from binary. It's possible that the `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` is involved in this conversion, so I'll focus the search there. Additionally, the `send` method in `requests/adapters.py` and the `urlopen` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/request.py` might also be relevant as they handle sending the request, which could misinterpret the literal string as an actual binary string. I'll search these functions to identify where the conversion might be an issue or where the literal string 'b\\'GET\\'' is being passed incorrectly as a method.",

  "initial_message": "method = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
