This results in a 404 Not Found response. The user is using Python 3.4 and the python-neutronclient library with the requests library. The issue seems to arise because the neutronclient library uses a command that converts all values to binary strings, including the method. The user suggests that if the requests library could handle the method value as a binary string, the problem might be resolved. The search results include several sections of code from the requests library, particularly in the models.py and packages/urllib3 directory. Key sections found relevant include the 'PreparedRequest' class and its methods such as 'prepare_method', 'prepare_body', and 'prepare_headers', as well as the 'RequestMethods' class and its methods in the urllib3 package. These sections deal with preparing and handling HTTP methods, headers, and body, which are directly related to the issue. There is also a mention of handling binary data in the '_encode_params' method of the 'RequestEncodingMixin' class. Given the context, these sections of code are likely to be relevant to solving the reported issue. However, there is a need to ensure that the handling of the method attribute is correctly managed to accept binary strings if that is indeed the root cause of the problem.",

This problem seems to be triggered by a command in neutronclient that converts all values to binary strings, including the method. The codebase analysis should focus on handling the conversion of HTTP methods appropriately and ensuring that they are not inadvertently converted to literal strings. \n\nIn the file_context, the 'RequestEncodingMixin' class in 'requests/models.py' and the 'HTTPConnectionPool' class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' are relevant as they deal with encoding and handling HTTP requests. The 'RequestMethods' class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/request.py' is also relevant as it handles the request methods. \n\nIn the search_results, the 'RequestEncodingMixin' class in 'requests/models.py' has several methods that handle encoding parameters and files, which could potentially affect how the method is encoded. The 'HTTPConnectionPool' class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' and the 'RequestMethods' class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/request.py' also appear again, confirming their relevance. Additionally, the 'RequestField' class in 'requests/packages/urllib3/fields.py' deals with formatting header parameters, which could also be relevant if the method is included in the headers. \n\nThe main goal is to ensure that the method string does not get converted to a literal string that includes the 'b'' prefix, as seen in the reported issue. The relevant code spans should focus on where the method is handled and possibly modified, ensuring that such modifications do not unintentionally alter the method string. \n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant file paths and span ids are: \n- 'requests/models.py' with span ids 'RequestEncodingMixin._encode_params', 'RequestEncodingMixin._encode_files', 'PreparedRequest.prepare', 'PreparedRequest.prepare_method', and 'PreparedRequest.prepare_body'. \n- 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' with span ids 'HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen'. \n- 'requests/packages/urllib3/request.py' with span ids 'RequestMethods.request', 'RequestMethods.request_encode_url', and 'RequestMethods.request_encode_body'.",

Additionally, the 'RequestMethods' class in 'urllib3/request.py' also directly deals with method strings, but without any conversion logic, suggesting a broader need to ensure all method-handling parts of the code are considered.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
