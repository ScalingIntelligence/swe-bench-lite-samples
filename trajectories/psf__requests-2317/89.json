The user observed that when the method is converted using 'builtin_str(method)', it results in a string representation of the binary value (e.g., \"b'GET'\") rather than the intended 'GET'. This causes issues downstream, particularly when making HTTP requests, as the method becomes invalid. The search results are focused on the 'requests/sessions.py' file, which is the correct file context for this issue. Within this file, the critical section of code is the 'Session.request' method where 'builtin_str(method)' is used to convert the method type. This conversion seems to be the root of the problem described, as it alters the method in a way that is not compatible with the HTTP request process. The search results included the precise code spans involved in the issue, specifically the 'Session.request' method and the use of 'builtin_str(method)'.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
