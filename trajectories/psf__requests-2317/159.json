The method 'builtin_str(method)' in 'requests/sessions.py' is responsible for this conversion, and the 'neutronclient' library is passing binary strings to 'requests', causing the 404 Not Found error. To resolve this, we need to identify how the 'builtin_str' function is defined and used within the 'requests' library, and possibly check if 'neutronclient' is handling strings correctly. I'll start by searching for the 'builtin_str' function and related binary-to-string conversion logic in the 'requests' library context.",

The problem is that when the method is converted using `builtin_str(method)`, it ends up as a string representation of the bytes, e.g., \"b'GET'\", which causes a 404 error when used by the requests library. This issue is present in Python 3.4 but not in Python 2.6, suggesting a difference in how string handling has evolved between these versions. The code spans in the search results include the `Session` class definition, its constructor `__init__`, and the `request` method. The `request` method is particularly relevant because it calls `builtin_str(method)` to convert the method type before making the request. This conversion is directly related to the reported issue, making the `request` method and the usage of `builtin_str(method)` the key areas of interest.",
