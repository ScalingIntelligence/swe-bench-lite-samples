The problematic line is `method = builtin_str(method)`, which incorrectly converts `b'GET'` to `\"b'GET'\"` instead of `'GET'`. This needs to be addressed in the context of the `requests/sessions.py` file, where the method is converted. Additionally, the `python-neutronclient` module's use of `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` contributes to this problem by converting method values to binary strings. Focusing the search on the `requests/sessions.py` file and related utility functions in `requests/utils.py` should help identify the exact locations to adjust handling for binary strings in HTTP methods.",
