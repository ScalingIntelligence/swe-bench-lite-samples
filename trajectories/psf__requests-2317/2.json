This conversion is causing the method to become 'b\\'GET\\'' instead of 'GET', leading to a 404 Not Found response. It's likely that there is a problem with handling binary strings in the `requests` library when used with Python 3.4. The `neutronclient` also seems to be using a command that converts values to binary strings, which exacerbates the issue. Since the problem is observed in Python 3.4 and not in Python 2.6, the issue might lie in how Python 3.x handles string types compared to Python 2.x. I will focus my search on the usage and handling of binary strings in the `requests/sessions.py` file and other related files that could influence this behavior.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
