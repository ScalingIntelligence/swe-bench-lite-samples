This problem is likely occurring in the 'sessions.py' file where the method is being converted. Additionally, the utility function 'utils.safe_encode_list' in python-neutronclient might also be involved in converting the method to a binary string. To address this, we need to investigate the 'sessions.py' file and the utility functions in 'utils.py' to understand how the method is being processed and ensure it handles binary strings correctly.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is related to the handling of binary strings when making HTTP requests using the requests library. Specifically, it mentions a command in `requests/sessions.py` where `method = builtin_str(method)` converts a binary string `b'GET'` to a literal string `\"b'GET'\"`, which causes a 404 error. In the search results, several relevant spans are found in `requests/sessions.py`, particularly in the `Session` class methods where `builtin_str` is used to convert the `method` parameter. Additionally, the `utils.py` file contains utility functions that might also be relevant. The identified spans include the `Session.request` method where `method = builtin_str(method)` is explicitly called, and other HTTP method definitions (get, post, etc.) that call the `request` method. This provides a clear link to the reported issue, suggesting that the problem lies in the way binary strings are handled during method conversion. Despite a detailed review, no direct reference to `utils.safe_encode_list` from neutronclient was found in the provided code spans, but the given context suggests this might be indirectly relevant due to its role in converting values to binary strings. Overall, the identified code spans directly address the conversion of method parameters from binary to string, which is the core concern of the reported issue.",
