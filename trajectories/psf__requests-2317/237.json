This discrepancy is not present in Python 2.6. To address this, we should first identify where the 'method = builtin_str(method)' conversion is happening, and then understand how to handle binary strings properly in requests. Additionally, the neutronclient's 'utils.safe_encode_list(args)' command might also be relevant, as it converts values to binary strings. We need to check if requests can handle binary string methods and potentially update the handling or conversion process.",
