The problem seems to arise from the `builtin_str(method)` command in `requests/sessions.py`. To address this, we need to look into how the method is handled in the `requests` library, particularly focusing on the sessions and utility functions that could be involved in this conversion or handling of the method. Additionally, since the issue is specific to Python 3.4 but not Python 2.6, examining compatibility handling and string encoding/decoding functions in the `requests` library will be crucial.",

The issue suggests a discrepancy in how Python 3.4 handles these string conversions compared to Python 2.6. Relevant code spans should include the part in requests/sessions.py where the method conversion happens and any related code in requests/compat.py that might affect string handling based on the Python version.

This directly addresses the conversion of the method from binary to a string and is the central point of the reported issue.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
