This conversion is causing a 404 Not Found response when the 'requests' library attempts to use the method. The issue is further complicated by the use of the 'utils.safe_encode_list' command in 'neutronclient', which converts all values to binary strings, including the method. The search results provided include the 'requests/sessions.py' file, which contains the relevant code span where the 'builtin_str' function is used to convert the 'method' parameter.
