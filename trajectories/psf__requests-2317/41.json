The problem seems to originate from the 'builtin_str' function, which is likely used in the 'requests/sessions.py' file or related utility functions. The task is to find the 'builtin_str' function or its implementation, and also look for how the method parameter is used and passed around in the requests library, particularly focusing on how it interacts with utility functions like 'safe_encode_list' that might convert inputs to binary strings.",

The issue arises when the 'method' is converted from a binary string to a literal string using the 'builtin_str(method)' command in 'requests/sessions.py'. This conversion results in a method value of \"b'GET'\" which causes a 404 Not Found response when used by 'requests'. This problem is observed in Python 3.4 but not in Python 2.6. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the conversion of the method from a binary string to a literal string and potentially modify or ensure proper handling of binary strings in the 'requests' library. From the search results, the relevant code spans include 'requests/sessions.py' where the 'method' is converted using 'builtin_str(method)' within the 'Session.request' method. Additionally, 'requests/models.py' contains methods related to encoding and handling of request data, which might also be relevant. 'requests/utils.py' includes utility methods that could be used elsewhere in the codebase, potentially affecting how the method is processed or communicated through the network.",

This conversion seems to be at the core of the reported issue, as it affects how the method is handled when it is a binary string. Additionally, the 'to_key_val_list' and 'to_native_string' functions from 'requests/utils.py' and 'requests/models.py' are also pertinent, as they handle string transformations and could be involved in the broader handling of binary strings. However, the specific line or function in 'utils' that converts all values to binary strings (as mentioned in the issue) is not directly found in the provided context. Further inspection into 'utils.safe_encode_list' or similar functions might be necessary to fully understand and resolve the issue.",
