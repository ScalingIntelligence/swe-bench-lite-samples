This problem arises in Python 3.4 specifically and is not present in Python 2.6, indicating a potential issue with how the library handles byte literals in different Python versions. Given the context, it's likely that the problem lies in how the `builtin_str` method in 'sessions.py' or related utility functions handle the conversion. The relevant search should focus on code sections involving the handling of HTTP methods and their encoding or decoding, potentially in 'sessions.py', 'utils.py', or 'models.py'.",

  "initial_message": "method = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
