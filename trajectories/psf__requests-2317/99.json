The problem occurs when the method value is converted from a binary string to a literal string using `method = builtin_str(method)`. This conversion is causing the `requests` library to send a method value of \"b'GET'\" literally, which results in a 404 Not Found response. To resolve this, we should investigate how the `method` parameter is handled in the `requests` library, particularly focusing on the `sessions.py` file where the conversion is explicitly done. Additionally, we should look for any utility functions or mixins that might be involved in this process.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
