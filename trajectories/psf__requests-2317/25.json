The user is experiencing a 404 Not Found response when the method is converted to a literal string, which suggests that the method handling may be flawed when encountering binary strings. \n\nUpon analyzing the provided search results, several relevant sections can be identified:\n\n1. The 'requests/sessions.py' file contains import statements and class definitions, including 'Session' and 'SessionRedirectMixin'. The 'Session' class includes an attribute '__init__' where default headers and other session-related attributes are set up. This could be directly relevant as the issue might stem from how the session handles methods or headers when processing requests.\n\n2. The 'requests/models.py' file includes definitions for 'Request' and 'PreparedRequest' classes, which handle the encapsulation and preparation of HTTP requests. The 'prepare' method in 'Request' class is of particular interest as it directly sets up the request's method, URL, headers, and other parameters. This method could be where the binary string conversion or handling may be causing issues.\n\n3. The 'requests/utils.py' file contains utility functions, including 'to_native_string', which explicitly deals with converting strings to a native string type (either decoding or encoding, depending on the Python version). This function could be crucial in understanding how binary strings are handled and converted in the context of HTTP methods.\n\nOverall, the search results provide valuable context relating to session handling, request preparation, and string conversion utilities in the 'requests' library. These findings align with the reported issue's focus on binary string handling in HTTP method settings.",

The file context provided includes the relevant methods and classes from 'requests/sessions.py', 'requests/models.py', and 'requests/utils.py'. From 'sessions.py', the 'request' method uses 'builtin_str' for converting the method to a string, which aligns with the issue description. The 'PreparedRequest' class in 'models.py' and the 'to_native_string' function in 'utils.py' also play key roles in processing the request method and URL. These cover the necessary contexts where the conversion of binary strings is handled. The functions 'to_native_string' and 'request' are critical and appear to be relevant to the reported issue. A thorough review of these functions, along with their interplay in handling binary strings, should provide a complete understanding of the issue at hand. Thus, the provided file context appears to be relevant and complete for addressing the issue.",
