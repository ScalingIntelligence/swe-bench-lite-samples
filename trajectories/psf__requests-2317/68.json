This seems to be due to the `builtin_str(method)` conversion in `requests/sessions.py`, which is causing the method to be treated as a literal string rather than a binary string. Given the context and the files provided, it's likely that the solution involves modifying how the method is processed or encoded in the `requests` library to properly handle binary strings. Focusing the search on `requests/sessions.py` to identify where `method = builtin_str(method)` is implemented and potentially tweaking it to handle binary strings better seems like a good starting point.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
