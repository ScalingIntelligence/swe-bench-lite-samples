This causes problems when the method is supposed to be a binary string but ends up being a literal string representation, leading to HTTP 404 errors. The focus should be on the `requests/sessions.py` file and possibly the `requests/utils.py` file due to the mention of `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` command. Additionally, the function `builtin_str` might be involved in the conversion process that causes the issue. The goal is to find if there's a specific handling or conversion process for the method in the library.",

The key point is the line 'method = builtin_str(method)' in the `Session.request` method. This converts the method, which might be a binary string like b'GET', into a literal string like \"b'GET'\". In Python 2.6, this issue doesn't exist, indicating a difference in handling between Python versions. The search results show the `request` method in requests/sessions.py where this conversion happens. Additionally, the `builtin_str` function is imported from the `compat` module, which should also be reviewed for how it handles different types of strings. There isn't direct evidence in the provided search results about how neutronclient is handling the conversion via 'utils.safe_encode_list', but understanding the behavior of 'builtin_str' in the context of requests could help in diagnosing whether the issue lies within requests or neutronclient. Also, the `utils.py` file shows helper functions, which might be relevant if neutronclient uses them for encoding, though none directly named 'safe_encode_list' is found here. This seems to be a good starting point for identifying the relevant code spans based on the reported issue.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
