I should focus my search on the `requests/sessions.py` file, particularly around the usage of `builtin_str` and how method parameters are handled. Additionally, given the context, it's worth examining the `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` as it might be relevant to the string conversion process.",

This conversion results in the method becoming a literal string representation of the binary data, which then causes a 404 Not Found response when used. The search results provide relevant sections of the code where 'builtin_str' is used, including the 'Session.request' method which directly calls 'builtin_str(method)'. Additionally, the 'to_native_string' function in 'requests/utils.py' also shows potential involvement with similar string conversion behavior. It's clear that the focus should be on the 'Session.request' method and possibly how 'to_native_string' could interact or contribute to this issue, given the similarities in handling string types.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
