This conversion highlights the exact problem described in the issue. The issue also mentions differences between Python 2.6 and 3.4, which could indicate a compatibility issue that needs attention. Given the context, it's clear that the 'request' method in the Session class is directly relevant to the issue since it performs the conversion that is at the core of the reported problem.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
