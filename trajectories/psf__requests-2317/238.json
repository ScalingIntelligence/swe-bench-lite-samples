This conversion causes the HTTP method to become `\"b'GET'\"` instead of the expected `'GET'`, leading to a 404 error. The problem seems to be related to how Python 2.6 and Python 3.4 handle string types differently. The `builtin_str` function or the `to_native_string` function might be key to the solution. Also, the `safe_encode_list` function in `utils.py` needs to be investigated for its role in converting values to binary strings.",

The key line in question is 'method = builtin_str(method)', which seems to be responsible for this conversion. In the provided search results, the relevant code span can be found in the 'Session.request' method of the 'requests/sessions.py' file, where the mentioned line of code appears. This span directly addresses the issue by converting the method from a binary string to a string type that is expected by the rest of the library. Additionally, the 'to_native_string' function in 'requests/utils.py' might also be relevant as it handles string conversions, potentially affecting how the method is processed. Based on the reported issue and the context provided, these two code spans appear to be the most relevant and directly related to the problem described by the user.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
