This seems to be related to the handling of method strings in the 'requests' library, particularly in the 'sessions.py' file. The problem appears to be caused by the 'to_native_string' function in 'utils.py', which is likely where the conversion happens. Additionally, the 'RequestMethods' class in the 'urllib3' package might also be relevant as it deals with HTTP methods.",

This issue is particularly found in Python 3.4 and affects the 'requests' library when the 'neutronclient' utility converts all values to binary strings, including the method. The problem lies in the conversion to a literal string instead of the intended binary string handling. The search results provide several potential areas of interest, especially in 'requests/sessions.py', 'requests/models.py', 'requests/utils.py', and 'requests/packages/urllib3/request.py'. In 'requests/sessions.py', the 'Session.request' method directly converts the method using 'builtin_str(method)', which is likely the source of the issue. In 'requests/models.py', the 'PreparedRequest.prepare_method' method is also relevant as it processes the method after it might have been converted. 'requests/utils.py' contains 'to_native_string' which might offer a function to handle the conversion in a way that avoids the 404 issue. Finally, 'requests/packages/urllib3/request.py' contains classes and methods related to request handling, potentially relevant to understanding how method handling affects the request lifecycle.",
