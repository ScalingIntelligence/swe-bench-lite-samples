This causes issues when the method string contains 'b'GET'', leading to a 404 error. The provided search results from requests/models.py reveal several key pieces of code that may be relevant to understanding and potentially resolving this issue. The 'PreparedRequest' class and its methods handle various aspects of request preparation, including URL, body, and authentication preparation. Notably, the 'prepare_url', 'prepare_body', and 'prepare_auth' methods are particularly relevant, as they deal directly with the handling of URLs, bodies, and authentication, which are all crucial aspects that could be affected by the type of the 'method' string (binary vs. literal string). Also of interest is the 'builtin_str' function from 'requests.compat', which is used in 'prepare_body' to convert the content length to a string, suggesting it's involved in type conversions like those affecting the 'method'. These pieces of code provide a comprehensive view of how the type of variables is crucial for parsing and executing the request correctly, aligning well with the reported issue.",

The focus is on the 'builtin_str' function in the context of 'requests/sessions.py' and how it affects the 'method' parameter. The provided search results include multiple spans in 'requests/models.py' that are related to handling the 'method' parameter during the preparation of a request. Relevant spans include those where 'method' is initialized and prepared, such as 'PreparedRequest.prepare_method' and 'PreparedRequest.prepare_body', where 'builtin_str' is used to set the 'Content-Length' header. These spans directly address the manipulation of the 'method' parameter, which is central to the reported issue. Additionally, spans indicating the preparation of the URL and the handling of the request body are also relevant as they could indirectly affect how the method is processed or interpreted by the server. The identified spans provide a comprehensive view of how the 'method' parameter is handled within the 'requests' library, aligning well with the reported issue.",

The 'prepare_method' function in the 'PreparedRequest' class directly deals with setting and preparing the request method. This function might be relevant to the issue because it processes the 'method' parameter. Additionally, the 'prepare_url' function in the same class is responsible for URL preparation and could potentially handle the method correctly, making it relevant as well. The file context seems to cover the essential parts of the code related to preparing and sending requests, where the conversion issue might occur. To fully assess the impact and find a complete solution, more detailed examination of how 'method' is processed through these functions and potentially other related functions in the module would be beneficial.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
