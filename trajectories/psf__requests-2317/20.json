This specifically impacts the `method = builtin_str(method)` command in `requests/sessions.py`. Since neutronclient uses this functionality and converts everything to binary strings, including the method, it causes unexpected behavior when the method is then used by 'requests' (specifically looking like 'b'GET'' instead of 'GET'). The problem appears to be Python 3 specific, as it does not occur in Python 2.6. Focusing the search on `requests/sessions.py` where the specific command is used and looking for any other places where binary methods might be handled could be helpful. Additionally, checking for usage of the `builtin_str` function or handling of binary data in any other modules impacted by this could be beneficial.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
