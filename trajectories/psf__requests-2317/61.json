This conversion results in a literal string (e.g., \"b'GET'\") that when used by the requests library, leads to a 404 Not Found response. The context provided includes relevant sections from requests/sessions.py that handle the method parameter and its conversion, including the 'Session.request' method where 'method = builtin_str(method)' is used.
