This conversion causes problems when the method is used, leading to a 404 Not Found response. The problem seems to be related to how `requests` handles the method value being a binary string. To resolve this, we need to investigate the `builtin_str` function and the handling of method values within `requests` to determine if the issue lies in `requests` or another library like `neutronclient`. Focusing on the `requests/sessions.py` file and related utility functions such as `to_native_string` in `requests/utils.py` would be a good starting point.",

This conversion happens because of the `builtin_str(method)` call within the `request` method. The issue is causing a 404 Not Found response when the method is used, indicating that the request is not being parsed as expected by the server.\n\nTo address this, we need to identify the code spans responsible for handling the `method` parameter in the `Session.request` method. The relevant code span in the search results is the `Session.request` method itself, specifically where `method = builtin_str(method)` is executed. This line is directly responsible for the conversion issue described.\n\nAdditionally, the issue mentions that neutronclient uses a command `args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)` which converts values, including the method, to binary strings. This indicates that the problem might not be solely in `requests` but also in how `neutronclient` prepares the `method` parameter. However, the search results do not currently provide information on the `safe_encode_list` function from `neutronclient`.\n\nBased on the provided search results, the most relevant file is `requests/sessions.py`, and within that, the most relevant code span is the `Session.request` method.\n\nGiven the current context and search results, identifying the `Session.request` method in `requests/sessions.py` as the relevant code span is sufficient for understanding the conversion issue. Further investigation into the `safe_encode_list` function in `neutronclient` might be necessary, but it's not covered in the current search results.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
