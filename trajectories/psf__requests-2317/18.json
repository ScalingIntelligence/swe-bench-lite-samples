The problem is initially traced to the command `method = builtin_str(method)` in `requests/sessions.py`, which is part of the `requests` library. This conversion can be problematic, especially when the method value is expected to be a binary string, as it is not suitable for HTTP request methods. The problem seems to arise due to differences in string handling between Python 2.6 and Python 3.4. It's important to find the exact location of this conversion and how it is being used in the `requests` library. Additionally, investigation should extend to the `neutronclient` usage of `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` method, which converts all values to binary strings. It's crucial to ensure that the method handling in `requests` and `neutronclient` respects the type expected by the HTTP protocol.",
