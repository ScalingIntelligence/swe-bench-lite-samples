This issue seems to be in the context of using python-neutronclient with an older version of the requests library (2.4.3) in Python 3.4. The key part of the issue directly references the method `builtin_str(method)` in `requests/sessions.py`. Upon examining the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `request` method of the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py`, where the `method = builtin_str(method)` conversion occurs. This conversion is crucial to the issue as it modifies the method from a binary string to a literal string. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py` is also relevant as it prepares the request that is ultimately sent, potentially handling the method in its prepared state. Further investigation would be needed to ensure all aspects of handling the method string are covered, including any checks or default behaviors that might be affected by this conversion.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
