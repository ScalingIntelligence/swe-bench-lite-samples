The `method = builtin_str(method)` command in `requests/sessions.py` is converting a binary string `b'GET'` to a literal string `\"b'GET'\"`, which causes a 404 Not Found response. This issue is not present in Python 2.6. We need to inspect the `requests/sessions.py` file specifically for the handling of the method parameter and investigate if there's a way to handle binary strings better. Additionally, we should look into the `requests/utils.py` file where the `safe_encode_list` method might be located, as it seems to be converting values to binary strings, causing the issue in `neutronclient` when it interacts with `requests`.",
