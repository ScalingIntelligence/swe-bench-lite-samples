This problem arises when using the `builtin_str(method)` function, which appears to be used in the `requests/sessions.py` file. The binary string `b'GET'` is being converted to `\"b'GET'\"`, causing a 404 error when the method is used. Given the context, the focus should be on the `requests/sessions.py` file, which is where the problematic conversion happens. Additionally, looking at utilities and compatibility functions like `to_native_string` in `requests/utils.py` might also help understand the root cause or potential fixes. Searching for occurrences of the `builtin_str` function and examining how the 'method' variable is handled across different versions and modules would be beneficial.",

This conversion is causing the method to be 'b'GET'' instead of 'GET', leading to a 404 Not Found response. The issue is identified in the python3.4 environment, specifically within the requests library and its interaction with neutronclient. The search results include relevant files such as 'requests/sessions.py' and 'requests/utils.py'. In 'requests/sessions.py', the 'Session.request' method directly involves the conversion of the method to a built-in string using 'builtin_str'. This is where the reported problem begins. Additionally, in 'requests/utils.py', the 'to_native_string' function is responsible for converting strings to native strings, but it does not handle the case where the string is already a native string, potentially leading to the issue of over-encoding. These are the critical sections of code that directly relate to the reported issue and need attention to resolve the problem with binary string conversion.",

  "initial_message": "method = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
