This conversion is problematic because the requests library expects the method to be a plain string, not a literal representation. This leads to a 404 error. The problem is exacerbated by the 'utils.safe_encode_list' function from neutronclient, which converts arguments to binary strings. It's unclear if the fault lies with neutronclient or requests, but reviewing how requests handles method strings and how neutronclient encodes method arguments could provide insights. Additionally, understanding how Python version differences (from 2.6 to 3.4) affect this behavior is crucial.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
