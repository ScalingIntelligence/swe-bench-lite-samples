This conversion happens in the `method = builtin_str(method)` command within `requests/sessions.py`. The problem arises because `neutronclient` uses `utils.safe_encode_list(args)`, which converts values to binary strings, including the method. The issue doesn't exist in Python 2.6, indicating a difference in handling between Python 2.6 and Python 3.4. To address this, we need to find the exact location of the `builtin_str` conversion and possibly the `safe_encode_list` function used by neutronclient. We should also focus on the encoding and conversion functions in the requests library to understand how they handle binary and string data.",

The problem seems to arise from the use of 'builtin_str(method)' which erroneously converts the method from 'b'GET'' to \"b'GET'\". The search results provide several code spans that could be relevant to the issue. In requests/sessions.py, the 'Session.request' span contains the 'method = builtin_str(method)' line, which is directly related to the problem. In requests/utils.py, functions like 'from_key_val_list' and 'to_key_val_list' that handle encoding objects could be indirectly related if they contribute to the encoding issue causing the binary string conversion. Also, in requests/models.py, the 'RequestEncodingMixin._encode_params' and '_encode_files' methods deal with encoding parameters, potentially relevant to understanding how the method parameter gets converted incorrectly. Additionally, the 'encode_multipart_formdata' function in requests/packages/urllib3/filepost.py handles multipart form data encoding, which could influence how the 'method' parameter is processed and possibly lead to the observed behavior. Finally, in requests/packages/chardet/mbcssm.py, the encoding states and char length tables are defined, which might be relevant if the detection of the method parameter's encoding goes wrong.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
