The search results show the implementation of the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py`, specifically focusing on the `request` method where `method = builtin_str(method)` is used. This method is crucial for investigating the reported issue because it directly handles the conversion of the method parameter. Given this context, the relevant code spans are those that involve the conversion of the method parameter using `builtin_str`, which is in the `request` method. The `__init__` method is also relevant as it sets up the session's initial state, but for the specific issue, `method = builtin_str(method)` within the `request` method is the critical point of interest.",
