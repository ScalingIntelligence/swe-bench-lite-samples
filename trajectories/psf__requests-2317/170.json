The conversion of the method from a binary string to its literal string representation causes a 404 error when the method is used. This problem might be specific to Python 3.4, as it doesn't occur in Python 2.6. To pinpoint the problem, we should investigate the encoding/decoding processes within the `requests` library, especially in modules like `utils.py` and `sessions.py`, focusing on the handling of the method parameter and binary strings. Also, since the issue might be related to the interaction with `python-neutronclient`, we should look into how `neutronclient` processes and passes the method parameter to `requests`.",

This conversion causes a 404 Not Found error when the method is used. The provided context includes a relevant function `to_native_string` in `requests/utils.py`, which aims to convert strings to their native format based on Python version. The search results provide additional context in `requests/models.py`, particularly the `PreparedRequest` class and its methods that interact with `method`. The `prepare_method` function directly handles the assignment and conversion of the HTTP method, which could potentially deal with this issue. Additionally, `RequestMethods` in `requests/packages/urllib3/request.py` directly handles the request method, which might need adjustments to handle binary strings without converting them to literals. Based on the issue, relevant code spans include the `prepare_method` in `PreparedRequest` and the method handling in `RequestMethods`, as these directly deal with the method value that may be a binary string.",

The file context provided contains a method `to_native_string` in `requests/utils.py` which is responsible for converting binary strings to native strings using either encode or decode methods based on the Python version. This conversion seems relevant to the issue at hand. Further, the `Request` class in `requests/models.py` has a `prepare` method that prepares the request by setting the method among other parameters. Although it does not explicitly mention handling binary strings, it's reasonable to assume that if the method parameter is provided as a binary string, it would undergo conversion before being used. Since the issue explicitly mentions problems when the method is provided as a binary string, it's logical to assume that the relevant function `to_native_string` could potentially solve this problem in the context of the entire `requests` library. Therefore, while not every specific usage of the method conversion is shown, the core functionality appears to be present and relevant.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
