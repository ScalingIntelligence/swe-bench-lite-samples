This conversion is causing a 404 Not Found response when the method is used. The problem seems to stem from the builtin_str(method) call, which is not handling binary strings as expected. To identify the root cause and potential fixes, it's necessary to search for occurrences of the builtin_str function and examine how the method parameter is being used and processed in the requests library. Additionally, investigating how the method parameter is handled in different Python versions (2.6 vs 3.4) might provide insights into version-specific discrepancies that contribute to the issue.",

This conversion happens in the `request` method within the `requests/sessions.py` file, specifically where `method = builtin_str(method)` is executed. The problem arises because the method string is being converted from a binary string (b'GET') to a literal string (\"b'GET'\"), which causes issues when the `requests` library tries to use this string for the HTTP request. This is relevant to the issue as it directly involves the method used for HTTP requests and the handling of the 'method' parameter. Therefore, the code span containing the `request` method definition and the line `method = builtin_str(method)` is highly relevant to the reported issue.",
