This conversion causes a 404 Not Found response when `requests` tries to use the method \"b'GET'\". The issue is further described as occurring in Python 3.4 with `python-neutronclient` and `requests`. Python 2.6 does not exhibit this problem, indicating a potential difference in how string handling has evolved between the versions. From the search results, the `requests/sessions.py` file contains the relevant code span where `method = builtin_str(method)` is used in the `request` method of the `Session` class. This span directly addresses the reported issue by showing where the problematic conversion occurs. Additionally, examining the entire section of the `requests/sessions.py` can provide context around how methods are being handled and potentially where a fix might be applied. The `requests/adapters.py` file, while not directly related to the issue of string conversion, provides additional context on how requests are sent and handled, which may indirectly relate to the problem at hand by showing how requests are prepared and sent.",
