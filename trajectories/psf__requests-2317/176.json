Specifically, the line 'method = builtin_str(method)' is converting the binary string 'b'GET'' to the literal string \"'b'GET''\" which causes issues when the method is then used in a request. The problem could be related to encoding issues or differences in how Python 2.6 handles binary strings compared to Python 3.4. To investigate, focus on the sessions.py file and related utilities that might handle or convert binary strings within the 'requests' library. Also, consider looking into components like 'utils.safe_encode_list' in 'neutronclient' if it's relevant to the encoding issue.",

Additionally, the `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` also relates to converting strings to native strings, which could be relevant for handling binary strings. Given that the `Session.request` method directly deals with the conversion of the method and the `to_native_string` function is likely used elsewhere in the library for similar purposes, these two code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "method = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
