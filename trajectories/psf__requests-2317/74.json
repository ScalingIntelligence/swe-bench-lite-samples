The provided search results include the file 'requests/sessions.py', which contains the definition of the Session class and its methods. One of these methods is 'request', which includes the problematic line 'method = builtin_str(method)'. This line is directly related to the issue as it converts the method from a binary string to a string representation that is not correctly handled by the subsequent request processing.

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
