The problem seems to be related to how the method is being handled in Python 3.4 versus Python 2.6. The method `builtin_str` is likely causing the issue, and it's used in a specific part of the `requests` library under `sessions.py`. Searching for the exact location and surrounding logic of `method = builtin_str(method)` is crucial. Additionally, checking how the `requests` library handles and expects the method variable could provide insights into whether the issue lies with `neutronclient` or `requests`.",

This suggests that the `builtin_str(method)` conversion might not be handling binary strings correctly, which is echoed in the user's environment using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).
