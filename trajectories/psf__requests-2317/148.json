The problem is likely due to the `method = builtin_str(method)` line in requests/sessions.py. Additionally, the `utils.safe_encode_list(args)` command in neutronclient might be contributing to the problem by converting all values to binary strings. Given that the issue does not occur in Python 2.6, it could be related to differences in string handling between Python 2.6 and 3.4. To address this, we need to focus on the handling of the 'method' variable in the requests library, particularly the `builtin_str` function and related encoding/decoding methods.",

This issue is identified in the context of the 'requests' library, specifically within the 'Session.request' method in the 'requests/sessions.py' file. Directly addressing the user's concern, the 'Session.request' method is shown to convert the 'method' using 'builtin_str'. This conversion step is likely the point of failure, as it results in a 'method' value which is a string representation of the binary string, rather than the binary string itself. Since the issue states that using a binary string as the method value should be handled correctly, the focus should be on altering this conversion step to preserve the binary string or handle it appropriately within the context of HTTP requests. Given this analysis, the 'Session.request' method in 'requests/sessions.py' is clearly the relevant code span to address the reported issue. No additional code spans are required as the problem and solution likely reside within modifying the conversion or handling of the 'method' in this specific method.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
