This causes problems when `requests` tries to use the method and receives a 404 Not Found response. This might be due to the way `safe_encode_list` in `python-neutronclient` is converting values to binary strings. The root cause could be in how `requests` handles the method value if it's a binary string. Searching for mentions of `builtin_str` and `safe_encode_list` can help pinpoint the issue.",

This conversion is causing issues when the 'method' is used, leading to a 404 Not Found response. The issue is exacerbated by the use of 'utils.safe_encode_list(args)' in 'neutronclient', which converts all values, including 'method', to binary strings. The reported issue suggests that handling binary strings in the 'method' parameter by 'requests' could prevent the problem.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided context and search results, it is evident that the 'requests/sessions.py' file contains the relevant code span where 'method = builtin_str(method)' is invoked. This code span is within the 'request' method of the 'Session' class, which is core to the functionality of handling HTTP requests in the 'requests' library. Additionally, the 'requests/models.py' file context indicates that 'to_native_string' is used for string conversion, which might also be relevant to the issue, especially understanding how 'requests' handles string encodings.\n\nThe search results confirm the relevance of the identified file and the code span. The 'Session.request' method in 'requests/sessions.py' is where the conversion from binary string to a native string occurs, which directly aligns with the reported issue. This method is crucial for processing the 'method' parameter, and the observation that it converts 'method' using 'builtin_str' matches the problem description.

  "initial_message": "method = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
