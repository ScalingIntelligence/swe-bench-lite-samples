This is likely due to the conversion from binary to string ('b'GET') that occurs in the sessions.py file. To resolve this, we should focus on the specific line 'method = builtin_str(method)' in sessions.py and potentially other related functions or classes in the requests library that deal with method handling, especially in different Python versions. Also, consider the context provided by related files such as models.py, utils.py, and adapters.py, as they might contain relevant methods or utilities for encoding and handling HTTP methods.",

The specific problem is that when the 'method' is passed as a binary string, it gets converted to a literal string representation (e.g., \"b'GET'\") rather than remaining a binary string, leading to 404 errors. Given this context, the relevant parts of the codebase to investigate are those that deal with the 'method' parameter directly. The search results include several key functions in 'requests/api.py' and 'requests/sessions.py' where the 'method' parameter is used in the context of making HTTP requests. These functions ('request', 'get', 'options', 'head', 'patch') are central to how the library handles HTTP methods. Thus, these code spans are relevant to the issue because they directly affect how the HTTP method type is processed and sent in the requests.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
