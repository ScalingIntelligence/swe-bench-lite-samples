The problem seems to stem from the use of `builtin_str` in `requests/sessions.py` when handling the method. This might be affecting the internal processing of request methods in the session handling. It's also referenced that `neutronclient` uses a command `args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)` that converts values to binary strings, including the method, potentially causing the issue. To resolve this, we need to check how the method is handled in `sessions.py` and also look into the `safe_encode_list` method in `utils.py` to understand how it processes and converts strings.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
