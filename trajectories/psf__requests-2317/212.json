The user highlights that the method is being incorrectly converted by the 'builtin_str(method)' function in 'requests/sessions.py'. This conversion is causing the method to change from a binary string (b'GET') to a literal string (\"b'GET'\"), which the server does not recognize, thus resulting in the 404 error. The issue seems to be aggravated by the interaction with 'neutronclient', which converts all values to binary strings, including the method, leading to this problem. The key section of the code that needs to be addressed here is the 'Session.request' method in 'requests/sessions.py', where 'method = builtin_str(method)' is called, resulting in the incorrect transformation.\n\nFrom the provided search results, we can confirm the presence of the problematic 'method = builtin_str(method)' line within the 'Session.request' method definition in 'requests/sessions.py'. This span is definitely relevant to the issue as it directly relates to the transformation of the method variable, which is the core of the reported problem.  The search result also includes the import at the beginning of the file where 'builtin_str' is imported, indicating that this module at least partially supports the operation that the issue is focused on.",
