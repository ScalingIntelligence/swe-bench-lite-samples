This conversion is causing a 404 Not Found error when the method is used in the request. The problem is likely due to differences between Python 2.6 and 3.4, particularly with string handling. To resolve this, we need to investigate the 'requests' library and potentially 'neutronclient' to understand how the method is handled and how binary strings are treated. Focusing on the 'sessions.py' file and related utility functions in 'utils.py' might reveal where the conversion or handling is going wrong.",

The issue specifically mentions the 'requests/sessions.py' file where the method is converted using 'builtin_str(method)'. This conversion seems to be the root cause of the problem as the binary string 'b'GET'' is converted to the literal string \"b'GET'\", which is incorrect for the HTTP method. Looking at the provided search results, the 'requests/sessions.py' file contains a 'request' method where 'method = builtin_str(method)' is used, which aligns directly with the reported issue. Additionally, the 'requests/utils.py' file contains the 'to_native_string' function, which also deals with string conversions, making it potentially relevant to understand how strings are handled across the library. Therefore, these two code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly address the conversion and handling of the method strings.",
