This conversion causes unexpected behavior when the request is made, ultimately leading to a 404 Not Found response. The user is using Python 3.4 and mentions that the problem does not exist in Python 2.6, suggesting a potential difference in handling string encodings between these versions.\n\nFrom the search results, two relevant code spans are identified:\n1. `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py`. This function converts any type of string (binary or Unicode) to the native string type of the current Python environment. This function appears relevant as it directly deals with string conversions, which could potentially help in normalizing the 'method' parameter.\n2. The `RequestEncodingMixin` and `PreparedRequest` classes in `requests/models.py`. These classes are involved in preparing and encoding requests, which aligns with handling the 'method' parameter during request preparation.\n\nConsidering the reported issue and the search results, these two code spans are likely relevant to the problem. The `to_native_string` function might be used to ensure that the 'method' parameter is correctly converted to a native string type that requests can handle appropriately. The `RequestEncodingMixin` and `PreparedRequest` classes also play a crucial role in how requests are processed, suggesting their relevance to the reported issue.",
