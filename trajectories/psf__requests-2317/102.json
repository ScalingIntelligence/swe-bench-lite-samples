This problem seems to be related to differences between Python 2 and Python 3 string handling. The method being discussed is `method = builtin_str(method)` in the `requests/sessions.py` file. We should focus our search on the `requests/sessions.py` file to examine how the method is being handled and potentially modify it to correctly interpret binary strings without converting them to literal strings.",

This conversion results in the method being '\"b'GET'\"' instead of the expected binary string 'b'GET''. This incorrect conversion leads to a 404 Not Found error when the requests library tries to use the method. From the provided search results, it can be noted that the 'requests/sessions.py' file is the relevant file to address this issue because it contains the 'Session' class where the 'builtin_str(method)' function is used in the 'request' method. As such, the code span in 'Session.request' where the method is currently being converted would need to be identified as relevant. Moreover, the problem seems to be triggered by the 'utils.safe_encode_list(args)' command in the 'python-neutronclient', which could indicate the need to refine the handling of binary strings within the requests library when dealing with such cases. However, the initial focus should remain on adjusting the 'requests' library itself since that is where the core functionality breakdown arises.",
