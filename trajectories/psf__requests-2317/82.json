This conversion is happening due to the `builtin_str` function or similar mechanisms in the `requests` library. To find a solution or workaround, we should focus on the method handling in the `requests` library, specifically in the `sessions.py` file where the conversion occurs. Additionally, we should investigate how `utils.safe_encode_list` in the `neutronclient` library affects the HTTP methods.",

This command is converting the method from a binary string (b'GET') to a literal string (\"b'GET'\"), which subsequently causes a 404 Not Found response when used by requests. The user is using python3.4 and specific versions of python-neutronclient and requests, where the bug appears to be related to the handling of binary strings in the method. The search result analysis shows that the `request` method in the `Session` class is indeed using `builtin_str(method)` to convert the method. This confirms the relevance of the located code section to the reported issue, as it directly addresses the method conversion that the user is having trouble with.

This conversion causes issues when using the `requests` library in Python 3.4, as it expects the method to be a binary string, leading to a 404 Not Found response. The search results provided include several files that are relevant to this issue, as they contain methods and functions that interact with HTTP requests, notably `RequestEncodingMixin`, `PreparedRequest`, and `utils.py`. These files contain methods related to encoding, preparing, and sending requests, which could potentially be affected by the conversion issue. Additionally, the `compat.py` file is relevant as it contains Python version compatibility code, which could be where the conversion from binary to string occurs. The `utils.py` file also contains functions directly related to encoding and handling strings, making it a likely source of the issue or a place to modify to fix it.",

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n"
