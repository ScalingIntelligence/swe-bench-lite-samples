This directly relates to the issue since an empty string might be treated as None or cause an exception due to insufficient handling. The other function, '_if_modified_since_passes' from 'django/utils/cache.py', checks if the last_modified time is greater than the if_modified_since time but does not specifically handle empty strings.
