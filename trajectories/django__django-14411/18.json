This issue can be traced back to the Django source code in the 'django/contrib/auth/forms.py' file, specifically looking at the definition of the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget within the 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget' span. The widget, by nature, does not render an input element, implying any 'for' attribute in related labels is inappropriate. The context suggests the 'for' attribute would likely exist in the rendering logic rather than this widget's class definition, suggesting refinement may be needed in the template used by the widget (as seen in 'template_name' attribute of the widget). Reference to the 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashField' involving the same widget further ties the issue directly to this part of the codebase. Scanning through the rest of the Search Results, particularly in 'django/contrib/admin/helpers.py', we see 'AdminReadonlyField', supporting the idea of consistent treatment across special fields in admin widgets, hinting at further evidence of logic that might need correcting for consistency across sealed widgets in the admin display.\n\nGiven the search results, it's reasonable to specifically look at the 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget' class and related widget management to focus on tracking and modifying where a 'for' label is created near this (or related) sealed widgets within the Django admin interface, ensuring the HTML structure corresponds appropriately with how labels are managed for non-input widget data display.",

From the provided context, we can see that the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget and related fields are located in the django/contrib/auth/forms.py file. However, the issue pertains to the way the admin interface handles labels for fields, which is likely managed in the django/contrib/admin/helpers.py file. In the search results, the django/contrib/admin/helpers.py file has a code span that defines how labels are handled for AdminField and AdminReadonlyField. These spans are relevant because they illustrate how labels are tagged in the admin interface, which directly relates to the issue at hand concerning the 'for' attribute in labels.
