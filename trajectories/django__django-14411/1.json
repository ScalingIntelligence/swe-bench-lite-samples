The new search results reveal related functionality in django/contrib/admin/helpers.py, specifically in the AdminField and AdminReadonlyField classes, which might handle label tags for admin fields. The label_tag methods in these classes appear to generate labels for fields in the admin interface. These methods could potentially be where the 'for' attribute is set for labels, and thus where the issue might need to be addressed.

There's no labelable element for the widget, so the label shouldn't have a 'for' attribute.\n"
