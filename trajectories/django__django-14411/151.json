The primary concern is the 'for' attribute in the label tag, which should not exist in the first place if it points to non-labelable elements. This issue might be related to how Django admin forms handle widget labels with the AdminField and AdminReadonlyField classes. I analyzed the relevant parts of django/contrib/auth/forms.py and django/contrib/admin/helpers.py. I found that the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget class in django/contrib/auth/forms.py does not define how its label should be handled, which hints at a potential oversight in this class or its usage with the AdminField and AdminReadonlyField classes. The AdminField.label_tag method in django/contrib/admin/helpers.py, however, handles the label tags with attributes that suggest it might manage labels dynamically without considering if the target is labelable. This could explain the mismatch found in the reported issue. Therefore, the solution might involve adjusting the behavior of these label rendering processes to account for non-labelable elements like the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget.",
