This suggests that the label for this widget should not have a 'for' attribute. From the provided search results, two files are relevant: 'django/contrib/auth/forms.py' and 'django/contrib/admin/helpers.py'. The ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget is defined in the 'forms.py' file, which is directly related to the issue. Additionally, the 'helpers.py' file contains classes and methods that are likely used in the admin interface, potentially related to rendering the labels for fields, which could be relevant in addressing the issue with the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget's label. Specifically, the 'AdminField.label_tag' method and 'AdminReadonlyField.label_tag' method could be where the 'for' attribute for the label is being applied, necessitating a review for the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget's label handling.",
