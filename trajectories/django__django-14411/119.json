I reviewed the provided search results and found the definition of the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget class and its related methods and attributes in the 'django/contrib/auth/forms.py' file. The ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget is a custom widget used in Django's admin interface to display password hashes in a read-only format. The issue mentioned is specifically about the 'for' attribute in the label element, which should not exist because the widget does not render an input element to which a label can be associated. I identified the relevant code span containing the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget class and its method definitions, which will be necessary to address the issue by either removing or adjusting the 'for' attribute in the widget's context or template. This will ensure that the label for this widget does not point to any non-existent input element.",

In the provided file context, we can see that the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget is defined, and it does not directly deal with HTML rendering, but instead, it relies on a template 'auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html'. This suggests that the correction for the 'for' attribute in the label might need to be addressed in that template file rather than in the Python code. However, the current file context does not provide the HTML template content, which is essential to confirm or correct the 'for' attribute. Therefore, we need to look for the HTML template file to be sure we have all the relevant context.",
