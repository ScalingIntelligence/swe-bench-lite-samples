Upon analyzing the code, the relevant code spans are found in the 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget' class within 'django/contrib/auth/forms.py'. The class definition and the 'get_context' method are relevant as they pertain directly to the widget and its rendering. This class is responsible for rendering the password hash as read-only text, which matches the description of the issue regarding the non-labelable element. Additionally, the issue might be related to how the label is rendered in the admin interface, which could involve the 'AdminField' and 'AdminReadonlyField' classes in 'django/contrib/admin/helpers.py'. These classes handle the rendering and labeling of fields in the admin interface and may be contributing to the issue by incorrectly associating a label with the non-labelable 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget'. By reviewing these parts of the code, we can better understand how the label for the 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget' is being managed and potentially address the issue by adjusting the 'for' attribute or rendering logic to avoid pointing to a non-labelable element.",
