The provided search results include the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget class definition with its template_name and get_context method, which deals with rendering the widget's context including password summaries. This is directly related to the issue as the widget is the focus of the problem, especially considering the rendering logic like the handling of no password set or identifying the hasher. However, the actual issue of the 'for' attribute in the label being incorrect is not explicitly addressed within these code spans. Since the issue might involve the HTML template (auth/widgets/read_only_password_hash.html) or the Django admin configuration more than the Python code, it would also be beneficial to check if the template or the admin configuration settings explicitly set any 'for' attribute to a wrong ID. As of now, based on the code spans provided, the core definition of ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget seems relevant, but the context on how it's rendered might be split between Python and HTML/template configurations.",
