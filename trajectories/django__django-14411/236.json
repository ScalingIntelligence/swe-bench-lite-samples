From the provided context in 'django/contrib/auth/forms.py', I found the 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget' class definition which is linked to the issue. I would expect that any specific instance of this widget rendering in the admin interface would need to be looked at. Given the current file context, it seems appropriate to look into the 'django/contrib/admin/helpers.py' file, especially the 'AdminReadonlyField' class and its functionalities to ensure that the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget, when used in an admin interface, doesn't incorrectly use a 'for' attribute. The purpose of 'AdminReadonlyField' in 'django/contrib/admin/helpers.py' appears to handle readonly fields in the admin interface, which includes cases where fields are rendered as text rather than form inputs. Therefore, this is highly relevant to the reported issue. The spans within 'AdminReadonlyField' related to label rendering and attribute handling, such as 'AdminReadonlyField.label_tag', correlates to setting the 'for' attribute, and hence making these spans essentials for any adjustments needed to resolve the issue.",
