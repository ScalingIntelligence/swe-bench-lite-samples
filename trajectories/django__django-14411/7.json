Additionally, 'django/contrib/admin/helpers.py' contains the 'AdminField' class with a 'label_tag' method that might be involved in rendering labels for various fields, including the 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashField'. This method could potentially handle the label for the 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget'. Given the issue's nature, these sections should be inspected to determine if they handle the label for 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget' and if any changes are needed to address the issue. The 'ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget' itself does not contain a 'label_tag' method, suggesting that the label handling might be in the 'AdminField' class. Therefore, both files and relevant spans are identified as pertinent to resolving the issue.",
