This issue directly relates to the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget class in the existing codebase under 'django/contrib/auth/forms.py'.\n\nThe current context already identified the relevant code spans within 'django/contrib/auth/forms.py', where the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget class is defined along with its get_context method that generates the context for rendering the widget. Given the nature of the issue, it's focused on the HTML rendering aspect of the widget rather than logic or additional contexts.\n\nThe search results primarily contain various parts of the Django template engine (e.g., in django/template/loader.py, django/template/engine.py, django/template/base.py) and other unrelated views (e.g., in django/contrib/admindocs/views.py, django/template/backends/jinja2.py, django/core/management/templates.py).
