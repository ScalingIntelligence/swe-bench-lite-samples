Upon analyzing the search results, the 'AdminReadonlyField' class in 'django/contrib/admin/helpers.py' seems relevant. The '__init__' method sets up the label, and the 'label_tag' method formats and returns the label tag. These methods likely handle the creation and formatting of labels for fields in the admin section, potentially including the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget.
