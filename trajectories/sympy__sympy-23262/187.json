The issue specifically points out that the missing comma in the tuple representation in version 1.10 causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple, which breaks the user's program that expects a tuple. Given this, the task is to identify and extract the relevant code spans from the search results that pertain to the printing of tuples in the Python code printer. After reviewing the search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are found in the 'sympy/printing/codeprinter.py' and 'sympy/printing/str.py' files, as they contain methods named '_print_tuple' that directly deal with the printing of tuples in Python code. These methods should be examined and potentially modified to ensure that tuples with one element are correctly printed with a trailing comma.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
