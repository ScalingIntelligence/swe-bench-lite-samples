The issue specifically pertains to the generation of tuples in the code printer, where a missing comma in the output causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. I focused on identifying code spans that deal with tuple printing and generation. After reviewing the search results, I found relevant spans in the `LatexPrinter`, `PrettyPrinter`, and `StrPrinter` classes. These classes contain methods such as `_print_tuple` which are critical for formatting tuples in the printed output. The `LatexPrinter._print_tuple` and `PrettyPrinter._print_tuple` methods handle the printing of tuples and include logic that differentiates between 1-tuples and other tuples, which is directly related to the reported issue. These methods are likely places where adjustments are needed to ensure correct formatting for 1-tuples. Therefore, I've selected these methods as relevant code spans for addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
