The printer is not appending a comma when converting a single-element tuple to Python code, which causes the resulting code to return an integer instead of a tuple. To address this, we need to find the part of the code responsible for printing tuples in the Python code printer and ensure it properly appends a comma for single-element tuples. The relevant files seem to be those dealing with code printing and especially those defining the behavior for tuples in different contexts (like sympy/printing/glsl.py, sympy/printing/c.py, sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py, and sympy/printing/pycode.py).",

The relevant portion of the codebase to look at would be the class responsible for Python code generation, which is PythonCodePrinter in the provided context. The specific issue likely lies in how tuples with single elements are being handled within the _print methods or similar. From the search results provided, the functions _print_known_func and _print_known_const provide insights into how known functions and constants are printed, respectively, but they do not directly address the tuple issue. The PythonCodePrinter class and its parent AbstractPythonCodePrinter are more relevant as they set up the environment and potentially handle the tuple printing. It's crucial to review the code spans where tuples are created and formatted in the PythonCodePrinter class to ensure that single-element tuples are correctly represented as (1,) and not (1).",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
