The issue is that the generated code is missing a comma after the element when the tuple should be enclosed in parentheses. This results in an integer being returned instead of a tuple. The analysis of the search results reveals that several files contain classes with methods to handle tuples in their respective printing logic, including 'JuliaCodePrinter', 'LatexPrinter', 'MapleCodePrinter', 'MathMLPresentationPrinter', 'PrettyPrinter', 'ReprPrinter', 'StrPrinter', and 'C89CodePrinter'. Out of these, the '_print_tuple' methods of 'JuliaCodePrinter', 'LatexPrinter', 'PrettyPrinter', 'ReprPrinter', and 'StrPrinter' explicitly handle tuples, including special handling for tuples of length 1. These methods use the pattern '(%s,)' to format single-element tuples, which correctly includes the trailing comma. Therefore, these methods are directly relevant to the reported issue as they ensure the proper formatting of tuples, preventing the regression described. The remaining printers either do not handle tuples directly with a method resembling '_print_tuple' or handle them in a way that does not involve formatting the tuple with parentheses as described in the issue. Consequently, the identified files and methods are crucial to addressing the issue.",

This causes the output to be an integer instead of a tuple when using the `lambdify` function. The issue is evident in the difference between the outputs of SymPy 1.9 and SymPy 1.10. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the printing of tuples in the `lambdify` function, as well as the respective code printers. The provided `lambdify` function in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` is involved in generating the lambdified function, and it uses different printers depending on the modules specified. Specifically, we need to focus on the part of the code that handles the printing of tuples and ensure that it correctly prints tuples with one element, including the comma. The code spans in the existing files like `sympy/printing/julia.py`, `sympy/printing/latex.py`, and others have relevant methods like `_print_tuple` that handle the printing of tuples. However, the exact spans that need to be modified or checked in the context of the `lambdify` function are within the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class and its methods that deal with the generation of the function signature and body. Therefore, the identified spans should be from the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class and potentially other printer classes that are used within the `lambdify` function.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
