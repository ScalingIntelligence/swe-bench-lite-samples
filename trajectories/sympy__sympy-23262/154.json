This behavior is observed in SymPy 1.10 but was correct in previous versions. The search results reveal several relevant code spans where tuples are handled, specifically in methods named '_print_tuple'. These methods exist in different printer classes such as 'ReprPrinter', 'StrPrinter', 'MapleCodePrinter', 'PrettyPrinter', 'JuliaCodePrinter', 'LatexPrinter', and 'MathMLPresentationPrinter'. Given the nature of the issue (how tuples are printed), these '_print_tuple' methods are likely places to start investigating or modifying to ensure the correct output for tuples, especially those with a single element. The presence of these methods across different printers suggests a need to ensure consistent handling of tuple printing among all printers in SymPy.",

The generated code for these tuples is missing a comma, which results in the return of an integer instead of a tuple. This behavior differs from SymPy 1.9 and earlier versions, which included a comma, thus maintaining the tuple type. The issue has been localized to the `_print_tuple` methods across different printer classes. These methods are responsible for how tuples are formatted in the output code. After reviewing the provided search results, I observed that the `_print_tuple` methods in several printer classes already handle the scenario of tuples with a single element correctly, adding a comma to maintain the tuple type. However, additional printers are shown in the search results that also use these methods, which should be identified for a complete overview.",

I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer.
