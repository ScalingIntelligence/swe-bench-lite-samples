This behavior is evident in the `lambdify` function's output when using a tuple with one element. To address this issue, it's necessary to identify the relevant code spans within the `lambdify` function and its associated printer classes, particularly focusing on how tuples are handled during code generation. The provided search results include the `lambdify` function in 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py' which is the main function handling the conversion of SymPy expressions into lambda functions. Additionally, 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' contains the `LambdaPrinter` class which extends `PythonCodePrinter` and is likely responsible for the string representation of expressions that `lambdify` uses.

Update the printer logic within the `lambdify` function to correctly format single-element tuples by ensuring a trailing comma is present.\n\nThe instruction requires ensuring that single-element tuples are formatted correctly with a trailing comma. This can be achieved by modifying the printer logic within the `lambdify` function. The relevant logic for this modification is found in the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class instance (`funcprinter`) that handles the conversion of SymPy expressions to Python code strings. The `doprint` method of `_EvaluatorPrinter` is responsible for this conversion, specifically handling the tuple formatting. The lines responsible for generating the tuple representation of arguments and expressions are what need to be modified to ensure a trailing comma is added to single-element tuples.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
