The code example provided shows that the printer omits the comma, resulting in an integer instead of a tuple. This issue is relevant to the 'lambdify' and 'PrettyPrinter' functionality in SymPy, particularly in how tuples are printed in the generated code. Upon examining the search results, several relevant code spans were identified. First, the 'lambdify' function in 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py' is directly involved in the code generation process. The 'lambdastr' and '_recursive_to_string' functions within 'lambdify' are likely places to look for how tuples are handled. Additionally, the 'PrettyPrinter' class in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' has methods related to printing tuples, especially '_print_tuple', which could be the source of the tuple printing issue since it handles the case of a single-element tuple. Focusing specifically on the '_print_tuple' method in 'PrettyPrinter', it seems to intentionally omit the comma for single-element tuples, suggesting it is where the behavior change might have been introduced. In 'sympy/printing/codeprinter.py', the 'CodePrinter' class and its 'doprint' method are also relevant as they deal with code generation and could be involved in similar tuple handling behavior.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
