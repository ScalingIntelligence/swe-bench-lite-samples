The missing comma in the generated code causes integers to be returned instead of tuples, and this problem seems to have started in SymPy 1.10. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that deal with tuple handling in various printers. Looking through the search results, several printers (JuliaCodePrinter, LatexPrinter, MapleCodePrinter, MathMLPresentationPrinter, PrettyPrinter, ReprPrinter, and StrPrinter) have methods named `_print_tuple` that are relevant to this issue. These methods handle the printing of tuples in their respective formats. For this specific issue, the relevant printer appears to be the `PythonCodePrinter`, which is extended by `LambdaPrinter` and others. Although the search results did not directly include the `_print_tuple` method for `PythonCodePrinter`, the `LambdaPrinter` itself does not override this method, suggesting that the responsibility likely lies with `PythonCodePrinter`. Since the issue involves code generation and specifically the handling of tuples with one element, the focus should be on the printers mentioned, especially `PythonCodePrinter` and its subclasses.",

As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
