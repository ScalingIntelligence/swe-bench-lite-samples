The code should print '(1,)' but is printing '(1)' instead, causing an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. This is a regression as the behavior was correct in SymPy 1.9 and earlier.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, several files contain code related to printing tuples and could potentially be relevant to the issue, specifically the `_print_tuple` methods in `StrPrinter`, `JuliaCodePrinter`, and `ReprPrinter`. These methods handle tuples and specifically add a comma for tuples with a single element, which is the correct behavior needed to resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, the most relevant file appears to be `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` which contains the `lambdify` function which is directly used in the provided MWE. The `lambdify` function is responsible for generating Python functions for the given expressions and may have been updated in SymPy 1.10 to introduce this bug.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to examine the `lambdify` function and its interaction with the printer modules. Based on the provided code, it seems like the `lambdify` function dynamically selects a printer based on the modules specified. This suggests that the printer module used for generating the Python code might not be handling the printing of tuples with one element correctly.\n\nOverall, the relevant code spans are located in the `lambdify` function, and the `_print_tuple` methods in `StrPrinter`, `JuliaCodePrinter`, and `ReprPrinter`.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
