The code generated in SymPy 1.10 lacks a comma after the element, causing the return value to be an integer instead of a tuple. This issue is evident in the `PythonCodePrinter` class and its handling of tuples. The search results show various printing classes such as `PythonCodePrinter`, `LambdaPrinter`, and others, but the critical section of code that needs to be examined is how tuples are printed in these classes. The relevant files are `sympy/printing/pycode.py`, `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py`, and others, particularly focusing on the `_print_tuple` method implementations. The `PythonCodePrinter` and its subclasses like `LambdaPrinter` directly influence the output format, which is crucial for identifying the issue. Key methods to examine are `PythonCodePrinter._print_tuple`, `LambdaPrinter._print_tuple`, and similar methods in other printer classes to ensure consistency and correctness in tuple printing. The solution likely involves modifying or adding logic in these methods to handle single-element tuples properly, ensuring the correct placement of commas.",

The missing trailing comma is causing integers to be returned instead of tuples. The file context provided includes several printer classes from the SymPy printing module, but notably, the `PythonCodePrinter` class, which is likely to be involved in the lambdify function's code printing, does not have an explicit `_print_tuple` method. However, other classes such as `JuliaCodePrinter`, `LatexPrinter`, and `StrPrinter` do have this method. It is plausible that the `PythonCodePrinter` class should also implement or override the `_print_tuple` method to handle single-element tuples correctly. Given this analysis, the relevant code context may not be fully provided, suggesting that further investigation in the `PythonCodePrinter` class or related classes might be necessary to identify the exact location of the issue.",

The closest relevant span is `LambdaPrinter._print_Pow` in `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py`, but this does not directly address the printing of tuples. Given the lack of a direct match in the search results, it's likely that the relevant code for handling tuple printing in Python code does not appear in the provided search results. More specifically, we would expect to see a method like `_print_tuple` in a class responsible for Python code printing, but such a method does not appear explicitly in the results.\n\nTherefore, based on the current search results, we cannot conclude that the task is complete, as the critical part of the codebase that handles tuple printing in Python code has not been identified.",

The method is found in other classes like `LatexPrinter`, `JuliaCodePrinter`, and `PrettyPrinter`, which suggests that the handling of tuples may be consistent across different printers. However, it is crucial to find the exact implementation in `PythonCodePrinter` to verify the behavior for single-element tuples. Moreover, the context includes the creation of dynamic methods for known functions and constants in `PythonCodePrinter`, indicating potential indirect handling. Since the direct search did not yield `_print_tuple` in `PythonCodePrinter`, reviewing subclass implementations and the dynamic method creation logic within `PythonCodePrinter` is crucial for pinpointing how single-element tuples are handled in the Python code printer.",
