This breaks the assumption that the return type is always a tuple. The `lambdify` function and its related printer classes are likely involved in this issue since they generate the Python code. The file context provided suggests that classes like `LatexPrinter`, `JuliaCodePrinter`, `C89CodePrinter`, and `PrettyPrinter` have methods for handling tuples. Therefore, it's reasonable to focus on the printer classes and the `lambdify` function in the search. The search should focus on methods and code snippets related to tuple printing and handling in these context.",

From the search results, the file 'sympy/printing/pycode.py' contains classes and methods related to code printing, including 'AbstractPythonCodePrinter' which is likely to be involved in determining how tuples are printed. Additionally, 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py' directly contains the 'lambdify' function and related utilities that convert SymPy expressions into Python functions, making it a primary candidate for addressing the reported issue. The '_recursive_to_string' function within 'lambdify.py' also appears relevant as it handles the conversion of various data types, including tuples, into string representations. Further analysis of these segments of code is necessary to pinpoint the exact location and potential fix for the missing comma in single-element tuples.",

The code generated for tuples with one element in SymPy 1.10 omits the comma, causing an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. This issue is evident in the `AbstractPythonCodePrinter` class and its method `_print_Piecewise`, which handles the printing of conditional expressions in Python. The problem seems to be related to how tuples are being printed, as the presence of the comma is crucial for distinguishing a single-element tuple from an integer. The relevant code span to investigate further is `_print_Piecewise` within `AbstractPythonCodePrinter`, as it contains logic for printing conditional expressions that might not properly handle single-element tuples. Additionally, the `lambdify` function in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` is also relevant for understanding how the generated code is structured and executed, which ties into the tuple printing issue. Overall, the main areas to focus on are the methods where tuples are printed and the `lambdify` function to ensure proper handling of tuples with one element, which is crucial for maintaining the expected behavior of the code printer.",

The provided file context and search results include various classes and methods related to code printing and lambdification. The key areas to focus on for identifying relevant code spans are the implementations of the AbstractPythonCodePrinter, PythonCodePrinter, and lambdify functions. These are central to generating Python code from SymPy expressions and need to be inspected for any changes or conditions that might result in the missing comma issue.
