The main problem is that the generated code for a 1-tuple does not include a trailing comma, leading to an integer being returned instead of a tuple. The focus should therefore be on identifying the sections of code responsible for printing tuples, particularly when handling 1-tuples. From the search results, several key sections were found that deal with printing tuples: LatexPrinter and PrettyPrinter classes, both having methods specifically designed to handle tuples. Notably, the LatexPrinter._print_tuple method considers the case of 1-tuples and appends a separator, suggesting that this could be a good starting point to apply a similar fix to the Python code printer in lambdify function. Additionally, in lambdify, the _EvaluatorPrinter.doprint method is directly responsible for generating the Python code, making it a primary candidate to investigate and modify to ensure that 1-tuples are correctly printed with a trailing comma.",

I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
