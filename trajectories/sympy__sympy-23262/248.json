Specifically, we are looking for implementations where tuples are printed and ensuring that when a tuple has only one element, it still gets a trailing comma. Scanning through the search results, I found relevant sections in multiple files under the 'sympy/printing' directory. Notably, these sections are primarily concerned with how tuples are printed in different contexts, such as in Python code, Julia code, LaTeX, and others. The most relevant parts are those that explicitly handle tuples with only one element to ensure they are printed correctly. For example, in 'sympy/printing/str.py', 'sympy/printing/repr.py', 'sympy/printing/julia.py', and 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', there are methods handling tuples and ensuring a trailing comma if it's a single-element tuple. This exact issue might be rooted in the 'PythonCodePrinter' class or related classes that handle Python code generation, where a fix might be necessary to ensure tuples with one element are printed correctly.",

For tuples with a single element, each printer adds a comma after the element to ensure it's printed as a tuple rather than a single value in parentheses. This consistent handling across different printers suggests that the issue might not lie in these printers but might be related to how the `lambdify` function or its _EvaluatorPrinter manipulates or constructs the final lambda function string.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the Python code printer in SymPy 1.10, which does not correctly print a tuple with a single element, omitting the comma that is necessary for Python syntax. The MWE provided shows that the output is 'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1)\n', whereas the expected output should include the comma: 'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1,)\n'. This discrepancy changes the type of the value returned from a tuple to an integer. The issue is not present for tuples with two or more elements.\n\nThe relevant part of the codebase involves the methods that handle tuple printing in different printers such as `StrPrinter`, `ReprPrinter`, `JuliaCodePrinter`, and `PrettyPrinter`. These methods, like `_print_tuple`, need to return the correct Python syntax for tuples, ensuring that they always end with a comma when they contain a single element.\n\nGiven the current context, focusing on the code spans from `lambdify` in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` and `_EvaluatorPrinter` in the same file seems pertinent as these are directly involved in the code generation process affected by this issue. The `lambdify` function is central to the process of turning SymPy expressions into executable Python functions, and the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class plays a key role in the actual code printing. Specifically, the `_EvaluatorPrinter.doprint` method is crucial as it constructs the expression to be returned by the lambdified function. By examining these parts, we can determine the extent of the changes needed or identify any bugs in the code generation process.",

As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
