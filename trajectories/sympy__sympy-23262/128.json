This impacts the output of lambdify such that a tuple with one element is printed without the trailing comma, which causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. The relevant part of the issue specifically mentions `tuple([1])` being printed as `(1)` instead of `(1,)`. The search results include multiple files and spans, but the most relevant files appear to be `sympy/printing/pycode.py` and `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py`. The classes `PythonCodePrinter` and `LambdaPrinter` in these files seem most likely to contain the relevant code since they deal with Python code generation and lambda expression printing, respectively. Additionally, the search results include various printer classes like `LatexPrinter`, `PrettyPrinter`, and others, but they don't specifically address the issue of printing tuples in Python code.

            "scratch_pad": "Based on the provided context, it appears that the `PythonCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pycode.py` and the `LambdaPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` do not explicitly define methods for printing tuples. This suggests that the default behavior of these printers, which might not include special handling for single-element tuples, could be the source of the issue. Specifically, the absence of `_print_tuple` or `_print_Tuple` methods in these classes indicates that they may rely on a more general printing mechanism for sequences, which might not differentiate correctly between single- and multi-element tuples. This hypothesis should be tested by examining the inherited methods and printer logic more closely, particularly in the context of how tuples are processed and printed.",

The user noticed that in SymPy 1.10, the generated code for a tuple with one element lacks a comma, causing the output to be an integer instead of a tuple. This is a crucial detail as it affects the type of the returned object. Given the context and the search results, the relevant classes and methods are likely within the `PythonCodePrinter` and `LambdaPrinter` classes and their respective methods, especially those that handle the printing of specific types like `Pow`, `Not`, `Indexed`, and `Symbol`, as they might interact with tuple generation. The identified spans, particularly those in `PythonCodePrinter._print_Pow` and potentially `LambdaPrinter._print_Pow`, are relevant as they might deal with the representation of tuples and powers, which could be linked to the issue. However, a direct method for the printing of tuples within these classes isn't present and could indicate a missing piece in the search results or current file context. There's a need to extend the search or review further to find the exact part of the code handling the tuple formatting.",

The relevant part of the issue is focused on the `_print_Pow` method in the `PythonCodePrinter` class in the `pycode` module, as well as related methods in `LambdaPrinter` in the `lambdarepr` module. After analyzing the search results, it appears that both `sympy/printing/pycode.py` and `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` contain relevant code spans that are likely related to this issue. Specifically, the `_print_Pow` method in both `PythonCodePrinter` and `LambdaPrinter`, as well as the `_print_Rational` and `_print_Half` methods in `PythonCodePrinter`, are relevant because they deal with printing expressions in a Python-like format. These methods are crucial to understand the code generation process for tuples and other expressions. Therefore, the identified spans in both files should be evaluated in detail to determine the cause of the issue and any potential fixes.",

This absence suggests that the printing of tuples, particularly with one element, might be handled by a more generalized method that does not explicitly distinguish between single- and multi-element tuples. This oversight could be the reason for the missing comma in the output for single-element tuples in SymPy 1.10. To address the issue, it might be necessary to explicitly define or adjust a method that handles the printing of tuples, ensuring that it includes the necessary comma for single-element tuples to maintain their type as tuples in the generated code.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
