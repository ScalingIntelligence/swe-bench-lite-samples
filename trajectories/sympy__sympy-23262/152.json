The `_print_tuple` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `_print_Tuple` in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` are relevant but do not explicitly address the issue of omitting commas in tuples with one element. It might be necessary to revisit these methods and possibly extend the search to other parts of the codebase that invoke or influence these methods.

This discrepancy from previous versions of SymPy (1.9 and below) affects code generation for tuples with one element, specifically when using `lambdify`. The issue can be traced to the code responsible for generating the Python code representation of expressions, likely in the `LambdaPrinter` class or its related methods in `lambdarepr.py`. Currently, there is no specific mention or implementation of handling tuples with one element within the provided code spans in `LaTeXPrinter`, `PrettyPrinter`, or `StrPrinter`, which suggests that the problem might lie in the `LambdaPrinter` class or its related methods not provided in the initial context. The new search results indicate that the `LambdaPrinter` class is defined in `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py`, which aligns with the expectation that the issue is related to the code generation for `lambdify`. Further, the `LambdaPrinter` class should have methods to handle the printing of tuples, especially those with one element, to ensure they are correctly formatted as tuples in the generated Python code. It is crucial to identify the appropriate method in `LambdaPrinter` that is responsible for printing tuples, such as `_print_Tuple` or its delegated `_print_tuple` method, to check and rectify the printing logic for tuples with one element. This approach will be the next step in addressing the reported issue.",

Both classes have `_print_tuple` methods, with `LatexPrinter` handling 1-tuples and deciding whether to add a trailing comma based on the 'decimal_separator' setting, while `PrettyPrinter` adds a trailing comma for 1-tuples to ensure they are distinguished from enclosing parentheses. However, the main issue of the missing trailing comma in the generated Python code for a 1-tuple in SymPy 1.10 is directly related to the `PythonCodePrinter` class, as identified by the `lambdarepr` and `pycode` files, which didn't include the specific handling of 1-tuples akin to the `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter`. Thus, while the broader search suggests appropriate handling mechanisms in related classes, the exact method responsible for generating the Python code and its handling of tuples is not fully demonstrated within the provided file context.",
