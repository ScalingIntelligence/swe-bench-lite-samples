Specifically, the problem is that SymPy 1.10 is generating Python code that does not include a comma for 1-tuples, causing the output to be an integer instead of a tuple. This issue is critical as it breaks existing code that relies on tuples being returned.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in multiple files, particularly in the printing modules. The `PythonCodePrinter` class in `pycode.py` is likely where the fix needs to be implemented, as it is responsible for generating Python code. Additionally, the `JuliaCodePrinter` in `julia.py` and `LatexPrinter` in `latex.py` both have methods for printing tuples, which suggests that the issue could be related to how tuples are generally handled in the SymPy printing framework.\n\nThe key method to focus on is `_print_tuple`, which is responsible for converting tuples into their string representations. Specifically, the methods in `JuliaCodePrinter` and `LatexPrinter` correctly handle 1-tuples by adding a comma, which is the behavior we need to replicate in `PythonCodePrinter`. It is also worth noting that other classes like `MathMLPresentationPrinter`, `PrettyPrinter`, `ReprPrinter`, and `StrPrinter` all have similar methods, which could indicate a pattern or a utility method that should be updated to ensure consistency across printers.\n\nGiven the issue's nature, it is clear that the `_print_tuple` method in `PythonCodePrinter` needs to be updated to correctly handle 1-tuples. The other printers can serve as a reference for implementing the correct behavior.",

The issue is that the printer fails to correctly format a tuple with a single element by omitting the trailing comma, which causes the return type to be an integer instead of a tuple. This behavior is inconsistent with previous versions of SymPy. I noticed that the problem arises specifically when there is only one element in the tuple. For tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct.\n\nNext, I examined the current file context provided in <file_context>. The files related to printing methods include sympy/printing/pycode.py, sympy/printing/julia.py, and sympy/printing/latex.py. The relevant code spans in these files handle printing for tuples, and they correctly format tuples with one element by including a trailing comma to signify that it's a tuple.\n\nThen, I analyzed the new search results under <search_results>. There are multiple files focusing mainly on different printing functionalities. However, the relevant code span from sympy/printing/julia.py correctly handles tuples with one element, suggesting a possible implementation approach for the Python code printer.\n\nI focused on the '_print_tuple' methods in all the files to identify any patterns or discrepancies. The method in sympy/printing/julia.py is particularly revealing, as it returns an expression wrapped in '(...,)' if the tuple has only one element, indicating that this might be the necessary correction for PythonCodePrinter to resolve the problem.",

The relevant spans include `_print_Not`, `_print_Indexed`, `_print_Pow`, `_print_Rational`, `_print_Half`, `_print_frac`, `_print_Symbol`, and `__init__`. Additionally, the `PythonCodePrinter` class has specific methods like `_print_sign` and unsupported methods like `_print_lowergamma`, `_print_uppergamma`, and `_print_fresnelc`. The context indicates that the issue lies in how tuples are printed, but there's no direct method for tuples in the provided spans, suggesting a need to expand the search or check related methods handling sequences.

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
