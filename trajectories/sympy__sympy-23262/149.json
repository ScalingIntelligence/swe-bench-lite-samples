This seems to be an issue with the printing logic for tuples in the code generators. Given the context of files impacted and their method signatures, it is likely that the problem lies in the `_print_tuple` method across different printer classes or the `_print_unpacking` method in `_EvaluatorPrinter` class from `lambdastr` module.",

The code generating the tuple representation incorrectly omits the trailing comma, causing the return type to be an integer instead of a tuple. This issue is particularly critical for code that relies on the return type to always be a tuple. To address this, the relevant code spans need to focus on the 'CodePrinter' and its subclasses, especially where the '_print_tuple' method is defined. The search results include several 'CodePrinter' subclasses such as 'JuliaCodePrinter', 'LatexPrinter', 'MapleCodePrinter', 'MathMLPresentationPrinter', 'PrettyPrinter', 'ReprPrinter', and 'StrPrinter', each with a '_print_tuple' method. These methods are responsible for generating the string representation of tuples in their respective languages. The '_print_tuple' method in 'PrettyPrinter' explicitly handles tuples by adding a comma for tuples of length one, ensuring the correct representation. Similarly, other printers should be inspected for correct handling of single-element tuples. Specifically, 'JuliaCodePrinter', 'LatexPrinter', 'ReprPrinter', and 'StrPrinter' have methods indicating they correct the issue by explicitly adding a comma for single-element tuples, which matches the expected behavior from the reported issue.",

In the provided file context, several printer classes (JuliaCodePrinter, LatexPrinter, PrettyPrinter, ReprPrinter, StrPrinter) have methods for printing tuples, and most of them handle the single-element tuple correctly by including a trailing comma. However, the actual implementation of `lambdify` that generates the Python code is not covered in the file context. The new search results provide the implementation of the `lambdify` function in 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py', which is directly relevant to the reported issue. The `lambdify` function uses a printer to generate Python code from SymPy expressions, and the missing comma issue likely originates from the printer used within this function. Therefore, the identified relevant code span is the entire `lambdify` function.",
