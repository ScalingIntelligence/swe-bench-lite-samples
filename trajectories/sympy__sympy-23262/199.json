This is a regression compared to SymPy 1.9 and earlier versions. Scanning the provided search results, it's apparent that several printers in the codebase have a method named `_print_tuple` which specifically deals with the printing of tuple expressions. A key observation is that the `JuliaCodePrinter` and `StrPrinter` classes have methods where tuples with one element are explicitly handled, ensuring the trailing comma is present. This behavior appears consistent across classes like `ReprPrinter`, `LatexPrinter`, and `PrettyPrinter`, all of which have implemented the `_print_tuple` method to ensure that tuples of length 1 are printed correctly. Given this pattern, it is reasonable to infer that the regression might be localized to specific printer classes that might not implement this check or have it misconfigured. Specifically, the code spans in the `JuliaCodePrinter` and `StrPrinter` classes appear most relevant as they directly address the matter of printing tuples with one element correctly. These implementations can serve as a model for other printers that might need a similar correction. However, the search results do not include the `PythonCodePrinter` which might also be involved and could be the source of the regression. Further investigation into the `PythonCodePrinter` implementation would be necessary to confirm.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
