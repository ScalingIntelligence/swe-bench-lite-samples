The missing comma in the output tuple `(1)` instead of `(1,)` indicates that the printer is not correctly handling single-element tuples. Relevant classes and methods that might need to be adjusted include `LambdaPrinter`, `_EvaluatorPrinter`, and any other methods handling tuple printing such as `_print_tuple` across various printers. A targeted search in these areas should help identify the exact location of the issue.",

Significant code spans were found in 'sympy/printing/latex.py' (LatexPrinter._print_tuple), 'sympy/printing/codeprinter.py' (CodePrinter._print_Function, CodePrinter._print_Catalan, etc.), 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' (PrettyPrinter._print_tuple), 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' (LambdaPrinter._print_And, LambdaPrinter._print_Or, etc.), 'sympy/printing/repr.py' (ReprPrinter._print_tuple), 'sympy/printing/julia.py' (JuliaCodePrinter._print_tuple), 'sympy/printing/str.py' (StrPrinter._print_tuple), and 'sympy/printing/mathml.py' (MathMLPresentationPrinter._print_tuple). All these sections handle tuples in different contexts, but none directly address the specific issue of the Python code printer, which suggests the issue might be deeper in the codebase or not directly related to these span areas.

The focus should be on the code spans related to tuple printing and Lambdify function generation. Analyzing the provided code spans, it's evident that several printers (LatexPrinter, PrettyPrinter, StrPrinter, ReprPrinter, MathMLPresentationPrinter, and JuliaCodePrinter) handle tuples, and all of them appear to correctly treat 1-tuples by including a trailing comma. The relevant sections are '_print_tuple' methods in these printers. Specifically, the LambdaPrinter class in 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' is crucial as it directly relates to code generation for lambdify. However, in the provided context, specific handling for tuples in LambdaPrinter is not detailed, suggesting a potential gap in its implementation regarding single-element tuples. The new search results reinforce this, showing similar '_print_tuple' methods that properly handle 1-tuples (e.g., MathMLPresentationPrinter, MapleCodePrinter). The absence of specific 'LambdaPrinter' handling for this case suggests it might not have been updated to correctly handle 1-tuples, which could be the root of the reported issue. Given this analysis, the identified spans and the presence of a probable gap in 'LambdaPrinter', these are considered relevant to the reported issue.

The key method of interest is `_print_tuple` in different printer classes. In the context provided, several files have a version of the `_print_tuple` method, which checks the length of the tuple. However, the `_print_tuple` methods across different printer classes do not consistently handle the case of a 1-tuple correctly by always ensuring the trailing comma. No references to other parts of the codebase suggest any attempt to address this specific issue in the provided search results. Therefore, the next step is to identify the most relevant files and code spans where the `_print_tuple` method needs adjustment to ensure a trailing comma for 1-tuples.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
