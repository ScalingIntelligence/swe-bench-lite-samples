Given the provided context, focusing on the _print_tuple methods and the lambdify function implementation could be the most direct path to finding the root cause.

This discrepancy between SymPy versions impacts the functionality that assumes the return type is always a tuple. The search results include a code span from 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' that imports various printers and defines a 'LambdaPrinter' class. Another span in 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py' is particularly relevant as it contains the implementation of the 'lambdify' function, which is the central point of interaction for generating lambda functions in SymPy. The process involves selecting the appropriate printer based on the provided modules and then generating the function string with the '_EvaluatorPrinter'. The 'lambdify' function code span is most relevant because it directly relates to the process of generating the lambda function and its output, which is where the issue arises with tuples containing one element.

It appears that the lambdify function is responsible for generating the Python code for the given SymPy expression. The PythonCodePrinter and its subclasses like NumPyPrinter and TensorflowPrinter are responsible for handling the printing of the code in different contexts. Given the issue, it is likely that one of these printers, especially the PythonCodePrinter, is not properly handling the printing of single-element tuples.

Given the context, the focus should be on identifying the code spans in lambdify.py and pycode.py that deal with tuple printing and code generation for tuples. The lambdify function in lambdify.py and the _print_Pow method in pycode.py are relevant because they handle expression printing and transformation into code. Additionally, examining other methods in PythonCodePrinter in pycode.py could yield insights into how tuples are generally handled in code generation. The search results do not immediately show the exact code span causing the issue with tuples, so further analysis of the conjunction of lambdify.py and pycode.py in handling tuples in code generation is necessary.

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
