This causes a return type mismatch, as an integer is returned instead of a tuple. Relevant files seem to involve code printers and the lambdify function, especially in modules like `sympy/printing` and `sympy/utilities/lambdify`. The focus should be on the `lambdify` function in `lambdify.py`, and various code printers, such as `PythonCodePrinter` in `pycode.py`, `LatexPrinter` in `latex.py`, and `JuliaCodePrinter` in `julia.py`, as they all have methods related to printing tuples and may be involved in the regression. Given the files already identified, searching within these files and particularly focusing on the `lambdify` function and methods related to tuple printing will likely uncover the source of the problem.",

This discrepancy impacts the output of the `lambdify` function and affects code that relies on the return type being a tuple. Searching through the provided code spans, several files and methods related to printing and handling tuples in SymPy were found. The methods `_print_tuple` in `LatexPrinter`, `JuliaCodePrinter`, `PrettyPrinter`, `StrPrinter`, `ReprPrinter`, `MathMLPresentationPrinter`, and `MapleCodePrinter` were examined. However, the most relevant file appears to be `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, specifically the method `PrettyPrinter._print_tuple`, as it directly deals with the formatting of tuples and handles the case for 1-tuples differently, which is likely to be where the issue lies. Additionally, scrutinizing the `lambdify` function in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` provides insight into how the expression is transformed into callable code and might indicate where the problem intersects with the printing mechanisms.",

This file demonstrates the logic for selecting the appropriate printer based on the modules used, and it includes the generation of the lambda function's body.

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
