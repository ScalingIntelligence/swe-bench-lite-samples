This is a regression compared to SymPy 1.9. The issue is relevant to the handling of tuples in the code printers. From the provided context and search results, it is clear that several printer classes (like JuliaCodePrinter, PrettyPrinter, ReprPrinter, etc.) have a method `_print_tuple` which is responsible for printing tuples. In the context provided and in the search results, it is evident that `_print_tuple` method is the key to resolving this issue as it directly deals with how tuples are printed in the code. All relevant printers handle the single-element tuple case by appending a comma. However, the search results confirm that all relevant printers do handle single-element tuples correctly, so the focus should be on identifying where the SymPy 1.10 implementation might be diverging from this expected behavior. None of the spans provided seem irrelevant since all are part of printer classes that could potentially influence the printing of tuples. Therefore, the search task is not yet complete as there might be more pieces of the codebase to explore or configurations that could affect this behavior.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
