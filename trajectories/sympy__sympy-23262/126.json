Given the provided context, it seems the problem lies within the code generation logic for tuples in SymPy's code printers. The relevant files and methods identified include '_print_tuple' in multiple printers, and '_print_Tuple' in 'C89CodePrinter'. The 'lambdify' function in 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py' is also likely involved, especially the '_EvaluatorPrinter' class which handles code generation. A search should focus on these areas to locate the code responsible for tuple printing in SymPy's code printers.",

Given the reported issue, the method '_print_tuple' or '_print_Tuple' within the Python code printer would likely need to include specific handling for 1-element tuples. Since 'sympy/printing/python.py' was not included in the search results, the focus remains on finding where this handling might be defined or if the handling logic from the 'repr.py' or 'str.py' should be adapted for 1-element tuples in the context of code generation. It's important to note that, while specific files are not yet identified, the issue's nature suggests that code responsible for printing tuples in the context of Python code would likely be in a file similar to 'sympy/printing/python.py', potentially even in 'lambdastr' or in the '_EvaluatorPrinter' class within 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py'.

The expected output should include a comma after the single element to ensure it's recognized as a tuple rather than an integer. The provided search results include relevant code spans that could address this issue: \n1. The '_recursive_to_string' function is responsible for converting arguments into their string representations. It specifically handles tuples, but the logic for ensuring a trailing comma in single-element tuples is missing. This function should be adjusted to add a comma for single-element tuples.\n2. The 'doprint' method in the '_EvaluatorPrinter' class uses '_recursive_to_string' to format the return expression. Any changes to '_recursive_to_string' will affect how tuples are printed within this method. Identifying the need for a specific check for single-element tuples could start by modifying the '_recursive_to_string' function to correct this behavior.\n\nThese observations suggest that the problem lies in the handling of tuples, particularly in the '_recursive_to_string' function within the 'lambdify' module.
