The example provided shows that SymPy 1.10 omits the comma in the generated code for tuples with one element, which changes the type from tuple to integer. This issue is critical because it directly affects the output type, which is expected to be a tuple, breaking programs that rely on the type consistency.\n\nThe search results provided contain three key spans: 'lambdify', '_EvaluatorPrinter', and '_EvaluatorPrinter.__init__'. These are relevant because they directly involve the generation of code from SymPy expressions, specifically the `lambdify` function and the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class, which likely plays a role in how the generated code is formatted and printed. The `lambdify` function is used to convert SymPy expressions into lambda functions that can be used in Python, and the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class, being part of the code generation process, is where formatting issues like the missing comma in single-element tuples might be introduced.\n\nTo address the reported issue, it is essential to focus on the `lambdify` function and the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class, particularly how they handle and format the conversion of SymPy expressions into Python code, including tuples and other expressions. Understanding these pieces of code will help in identifying where the formatting error occurs and how to correct it.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
