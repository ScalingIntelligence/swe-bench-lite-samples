This problem occurs when using the `lambdify` function with a 1-tuple. The search for relevant code spans should focus on parts of the codebase that handle the printing or conversion of tuples, especially for single-element tuples. From the search results, several files and methods stand out as relevant. These include `StrPrinter`, `JuliaCodePrinter`, `ReprPrinter`, and others, all of which have a `_print_tuple` method that specifically addresses the printing of tuples, including handling single-element tuples. These methods are crucial because they determine how tuples are represented in the output code, and incorrect handling could lead to the issue described in the reported problem. Thus, these code spans are identified as relevant.",

Specifically, the output should include a comma to ensure the result is a tuple rather than an integer, but this comma is missing in SymPy 1.10. From the provided file context and search results, the relevant sections of code to address this issue are found in multiple printer classes within the sympy.printing module. These include StrPrinter, JuliaCodePrinter, ReprPrinter, MapleCodePrinter, PrettyPrinter, and LatexPrinter, all of which have a _print_tuple method that handles tuples. The issue is that in SymPy 1.10, the tuple with one element is not correctly formatted with a trailing comma. This affects the lambdify function in sympy/utilities/lambdify.py as it relies on these printers for generating Python code. The relevant code spans are those where the _print_tuple method is defined and where a tuple with one element is handled. Given the uniformity of the _print_tuple methods across these printer classes, identifying the relevant code spans primarily involves checking these methods in each class.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
