Specifically, the user is experiencing a change in behavior between SymPy 1.9 and 1.10 where the lambdify function outputs without a trailing comma for a 1-tuple, causing the result to be an integer instead of a tuple. This issue is critical as it disrupts the expected behavior of returning a tuple for any len(tuples), which is a breaking change. \n\nBy analyzing the search results, it is evident that the issue lies within the printing of tuples in different printers within SymPy (e.g., LatexPrinter, StrPrinter, JuliaCodePrinter, etc.). Each of these printers has a method _print_tuple that handles the printing of tuples differently, with some correctly adding a trailing comma for 1-tuples and others not. Given the reported issue, it is necessary to identify and address the part of the code responsible for generating the code snippet from the lambdify function to ensure that it always includes a trailing comma for 1-tuples. \n\nFrom the search results, I have identified relevant spans in the files: 'sympy/printing/latex.py', 'sympy/printing/str.py', 'sympy/printing/julia.py', and possibly 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py'. These files contain the methods _print_tuple or are directly related to the lambdify function. By focusing on these areas, particularly on how each printer handles the printing of tuples with a single element, it should be possible to pinpoint the exact location and nature of the issue, and determine if a fix or workaround is needed in the code generation side to ensure the trailing comma for 1-tuples is consistently included across all printers which generate Python code. This approach will allow for a targeted and thorough investigation of the reported issue, ensuring that the identified code spans are relevant and adequate to address the problem. ",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
