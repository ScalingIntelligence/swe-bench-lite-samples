            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the output of SymPy's `lambdify` function not treating tuples with a single element correctly. Specifically, SymPy 1.10 outputs an integer instead of a tuple when a tuple contains a single element due to the missing comma. This issue can be explored in the context of the `PythonCodePrinter` class and its methods for handling tuples. The search results provide insights into how tuples are printed in different contexts, but the specific method responsible for printing tuples in the `PythonCodePrinter` is not directly visible in the provided spans. Therefore, further investigation into the `_print_tuple` method of the `PythonCodePrinter` class is necessary to resolve this issue. Also, the `_recursive_to_string` function in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` may be relevant as it handles string representation of arguments. However, the direct relevance of the `PrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` to this issue is minimal, as it focuses on pretty printing rather than code generation.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
