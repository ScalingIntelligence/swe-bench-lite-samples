The search results include several code printers such as JuliaCodePrinter, LatexPrinter, MapleCodePrinter, MathMLPresentationPrinter, PrettyPrinter, ReprPrinter, and StrPrinter, each with a method named `_print_tuple`. These methods are responsible for printing tuples in different formats. The most relevant code spans are those from JuliaCodePrinter, LatexPrinter, ReprPrinter, and StrPrinter, as they explicitly handle tuples with one element by adding a trailing comma. These methods should be reviewed and potentially updated to ensure consistency and correctness, especially for tuples with one element. The presence of these methods in different printers indicates a common issue in how tuples are printed across various formats, reinforcing the need for a consistent fix.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
