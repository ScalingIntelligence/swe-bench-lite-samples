The main focus is on identifying the code span responsible for generating the Python code so that it can be corrected to ensure the proper printing of tuples. The relevant parts of the codebase are those that deal with code generation for tuples, which include the _print_tuple methods in different classes of the 'sympy.printing' module. From the provided search results, four files contain relevant _print_tuple methods: 'sympy/printing/latex.py', 'sympy/printing/codeprinter.py', 'sympy/printing/glsl.py', and 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py'. Each of these methods deals with the formatting of tuples, which is directly related to the reported issue. Additionally, the 'sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py' file contains the LambdaPrinter class, which may also be involved in the code generation process. Furthermore, 'sympy/utilities/lambdify.py' contains the _EvaluatorPrinter class, which is responsible for generating the actual Python function from SymPy expressions, indicating its relevance to the issue. The identified code spans include the _print_tuple methods in the mentioned files as well as the LambdaPrinter class. These spans are directly responsible for how tuples, particularly 1-tuples, are represented in the generated code.",

However, the search results did align with the expectation that the issue might be related to the methods handling tuple representation in the code generation process, particularly within `lambdarepr.py` and `utilities/lambdify.py`. The absence of a clear implementation or fix in these files suggests that the problem might be more nuanced or possibly a regression that wasn't immediately addressed in the code. Given this, further investigation into how single-element tuples are handled specifically in the context of code generation within the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class and related methods in `lambdarepr.py` is warranted. Additionally, exploring how the tuple handling mechanics are designed to interact with the overall code generation framework in `lambdify.py` could potentially reveal the root cause or a suitable workaround. Expanding the search to include broader interactions and checks within the code generation process, especially around the handling of expressions for `lambdify`, might be necessary.",

This is a regression compared to SymPy 1.9. The key focus is on the 'lambdify' function and its output when dealing with tuples. From the file context, we see several code spans related to printing lambdas and tuples. The new search results reveal more detailed implementations of the LambdaPrinter class and the _EvaluatorPrinter class, which are directly related to the code generation process affected by the issue. Specifically, the _EvaluatorPrinter class's 'doprint' method is crucial as it constructs the lambda function's body and returns the final string representation. This method might need adjustment to ensure tuples with one element are printed correctly, maintaining the trailing comma to distinguish them from integers. The identified spans are relevant and suggest potential points of modification to address the reported issue.",
