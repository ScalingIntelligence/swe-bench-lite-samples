The main problem is that the generated code in SymPy 1.10 lacks a comma, which causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. This issue affects the `lambdify` function and potentially other functions that rely on correct tuple representation. The search results include several files and spans that might be relevant to the issue. The `_print_tuple` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` appears to handle how tuples are printed, and it might be relevant to check if these methods are properly handling single-element tuples. Additionally, the `AbstractPythonCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pycode.py` could also be involved in the code generation process and warrants inspection.\n\nSteps to analyze:\n1. Check the `_print_tuple` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py` to see how it handles tuples and if it correctly accounts for single-element tuples.\n2. Inspect the `_print_tuple` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` for similar handling and correctness.\n3. Review the `AbstractPythonCodePrinter` class and its methods in `sympy/printing/pycode.py` to understand the code generation logic and see if it handles tuples, especially single-element tuples, correctly.\n4. Verify if the `LambdPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py` is involved in the printing of tuples and how it handles these cases.\n\nBy examining these parts of the codebase, we may identify the source of the issue where the comma is missing in the generated code for single-element tuples.",

The user noticed that SymPy 1.10 does not include a trailing comma in a single-element tuple, causing it to be interpreted as an integer rather than a tuple. The search results contain several relevant spans from different files, primarily focusing on the Python code printer and tuple printing logic. The spans in 'sympy/printing/pycode.py' include methods for printing known functions and constants, and an abstract class for Python code printing. The 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' file also has spans for printing tuples, including a 1-tuple. However, the most directly relevant code spans are in 'sympy/printing/pycode.py', where methods for printing tuples and handling the printing of modular arithmetic and piecewise expressions are located. These spans seem to specifically handle the printing logic for tuples, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Given the current search results and the relevance of the identified spans, it is reasonable to conclude that the search task is complete.",

The code printer in SymPy 1.10 is omitting the comma after the element in a single-element tuple, causing it to be interpreted as an integer instead of a tuple. This issue is crucial for understanding tuple handling in the code printer.\n\nI examine the provided code spans from the search results to identify where the handling of tuples is defined. I look specifically for the _print_tuple method across the different classes because this method is responsible for generating the string representation of tuples in the output code.\n\nThe relevant code spans I identified are from the classes PythonCodePrinter in sympy/printing/pycode.py, PrettyPrinter in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py, LatexPrinter in sympy/printing/latex.py, and LambdaPrinter in sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py.

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
