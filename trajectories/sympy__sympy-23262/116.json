This differs from SymPy 1.9 and earlier, which correctly outputs a comma ensuring the result is a tuple. The problem seems to be within the code generation logic, specifically how tuples with one element are handled by the `lambdify` function. Relevant classes and methods include `LatexPrinter`, `JuliaCodePrinter`, `GLSLPrinter`, `C89CodePrinter`, `CodePrinter`, `LambdaPrinter`, `PrettyPrinter`, and `PythonCodePrinter`, all of which might have interactions with tuple printing. Focus should be on methods like `_print_tuple`, `_print_list`, and `doprint` within these classes. The `lambdify` function in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` is likely central, as it involves code generation for functions and potentially needs adjustment to ensure correct tuple printing.",

This issue seems to be related to how tuples are printed in different code printers within SymPy. The search results include several classes like LatexPrinter, GLSLPrinter, C89CodePrinter, and JuliaCodePrinter, all of which have methods for printing tuples or lists. Among these, the JuliaCodePrinter directly addresses the issue of printing tuples with a single element, and thus it is likely the most relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the GLSLPrinter and C89CodePrinter classes handle tuples but do not specifically address the handling of 1-tuples, which suggests they might maintain the behavior that is causing the issue in SymPy 1.10. Therefore, the focus should be on the JuliaCodePrinter for potential fixes or workarounds to address the printing of tuples with one element.",

The expected output should include a trailing comma to indicate a tuple, but SymPy 1.10 fails to include this comma. The relevant files and methods to investigate are those related to code printing for tuples, particularly in the PythonCodePrinter class within 'sympy/printing/pycode.py'. This is suggested by the issue's description of the problem and the specific focus on the output generated by the Python code printer. Additionally, other printers such as ReprPrinter and StrPrinter in 'sympy/printing/repr.py' and 'sympy/printing/str.py', respectively, have implementations for printing tuples that should be consistent with the issue. It's important to review the _print_tuple methods in these classes to ensure they handle single-element tuples correctly.",

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
