The specific problem is that the code printer fails to add a comma after the single element in a tuple, causing it to be interpreted as an integer instead of a tuple. This behavior changed in SymPy 1.10, leading to a regression. Potential points of investigation include the _print_tuple method in various printers and the __str__ or _sympyrepr methods in the related classes. To narrow down the search, focusing on the files that implement or use _print_tuple methods and the lambdify function as specified in the issue would be a logical first step.",

The search results provided include multiple printer classes such as LatexPrinter, JuliaCodePrinter, GLSLPrinter, PrettyPrinter, StrPrinter, ReprPrinter, MCodePrinter, MathMLPresentationPrinter, and MapleCodePrinter, each implementing a method `_print_tuple`. The relevant code spans are those where `_print_tuple` methods handle the case of a tuple with one element. Identifying these methods will help in understanding how the printer handles the printing of tuples with one element and possibly providing a workaround or fixing the issue. The identified spans include `LatexPrinter._print_tuple`, `JuliaCodePrinter._print_tuple`, `GLSLPrinter:11`, `PrettyPrinter._print_tuple`, `StrPrinter._print_tuple`, `ReprPrinter._print_tuple`, `MCodePrinter:13`, `MathMLPresentationPrinter._print_tuple`, and `MapleCodePrinter._print_tuple`.

I found corresponding methods in latex.py, julia.py, pretty.py, str.py, repr.py, and mathml.py. The implementations check if the tuple length is one and properly format it as `(1,)` in each case, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue. However, I did not find the `_print_tuple` method in glsl.py or mathematica.py, where it defaults to using `_print_list`. This omission might suggest these implementations are not directly relevant to the issue but don't contradict the theory that the problem lies in the `_print_tuple` method for one-element tuples.

  "initial_message": "Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\nfrom sympy import lambdify\r\n\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\r\n```\r\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1,)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1)\\n'\r\n```\r\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \r\n\r\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\r\n```python\r\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\r\n```\r\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\n    return (1, 2)\\n'\r\n```\r\nThis result is expected.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you. \n"
