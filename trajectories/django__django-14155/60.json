From the search results, the relevant code spans are located within the ResolverMatch class in the django/urls/resolvers.py file. The __init__ and __repr__ methods of ResolverMatch are considered relevant because they directly deal with handling and representing functions and their arguments, which is central to the issue. Additionally, the URLPattern and URLResolver classes are included as they interact with ResolverMatch and could potentially have an impact on how partial functions are handled during resolution. In django/urls/utils.py, the get_callable function is important because it determines how callable views are retrieved, which could be a pivotal step in handling partial functions correctly.

Additionally, the __repr__ method shows the func argument as functools.partial which is not informative.
