This means that when a partial function is used as a view, the representation of the ResolverMatch object does not show the underlying function or the arguments provided to the partial function, which is problematic for debugging and clarity. To address this, the ResolverMatch class needs to be modified to unwrap functools.partial objects properly in its __init__ method. Thus, the search should focus on the ResolverMatch class in the django/urls/resolvers.py file, with an emphasis on identifying where functools.partial objects are handled or could be handled better.",

The __repr__ method should reveal the underlying function and arguments provided when a partial function is passed as the view. From the search results, it's evident that the ResolverMatch class and its methods (__init__ and __repr__) are relevant to the issue. The __init__ method currently sets self.func to the function passed to it, but it doesn't handle the case where func is a functools.partial object. This is where the problem lies, and it suggests that the method should unwrap the partial object to get the underlying function and its arguments. The __repr__ method then uses self._func_path, which is derived from func, to display the function in a readable way. However, if func is a partial object, self._func_path will not provide useful information. Therefore, both __init__ and __repr__ methods need to be adjusted to adequately handle functools.partial objects. The provided code spans of __init__ and __repr__ are relevant and should be considered in addressing the issue.",
