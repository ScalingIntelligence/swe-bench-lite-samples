The __init__ and __repr__ methods are of particular interest.\n\nIn ResolverMatch.__init__, the func attribute is assigned directly, and there's a check to set _func_path based on whether func is a class-based or function-based view. This is a key part where unwrapping functools.partial could be implemented.\n\nThe __repr__ method constructs a string representation of the ResolverMatch object, utilizing _func_path among other attributes. This method needs to be adjusted to reveal more details if func is an instance of functools.partial.\n\nThe search results do not introduce new relevant code spans outside of what is already provided in the file context.
