The current implementation in `ResolverMatch.__repr__` doesn't handle `functools.partial` functions well as it shows 'functools.partial' instead of revealing the underlying function and its arguments. The issue suggests unwrapping `functools.partial` objects in `ResolverMatch.__init__` to handle them specially. The provided search results contain the relevant code for `ResolverMatch` class in 'django/urls/resolvers.py' with the __init__ and __repr__ methods. Additionally, 'django/urls/utils.py' contains an import for `functools` and a function `get_callable` that might interact with `partial` functions, suggesting potential relevance. The identified code spans for `ResolverMatch.__init__` and `ResolverMatch.__repr__` are relevant as they directly pertain to the construction and representation of `ResolverMatch` objects, which is central to the issue. However, the span in 'django/urls/utils.py' is also considered relevant as it deals with the handling of callable views, which could include `partial` functions.",
