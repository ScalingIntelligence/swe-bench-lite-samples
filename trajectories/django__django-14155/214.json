The suggested solution is to unwrap these objects in the `ResolverMatch.__init__` method. The provided search results include relevant sections of `django/urls/resolvers.py` that define `ResolverMatch` and its methods. There, we can see the implementation of `__init__` and `__repr__`, which will likely need modifications to address the issue. Additionally, the `FunctoolsPartialSerializer` class in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` provides insight into how `functools.partial` objects are serialized, which might be helpful context for understanding the issue.

The current implementation of `ResolverMatch.__repr__` does not handle `functools.partial` objects gracefully, leading to uninformative representations. To address this, we need to unwrap `functools.partial` objects in `ResolverMatch.__init__` to expose the underlying function and its arguments. This would make the representation more informative and useful. \n\nExamining the current file context and search results, we find repeated instances of the `ResolverMatch` class and its methods (`__init__` and `__repr__`) in the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file. These are the critical sections where modifications would be needed to handle `functools.partial` objects appropriately. \n\nFrom the search results, we can identify three relevant code spans within the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file: the `__init__` method of `ResolverMatch`, where `functools.partial` objects could be unwrapped; the `__repr__` method, which requires modifications to display the unwrapped function and its arguments; and the `resolve` method of `URLPattern` and `URLResolver`, which instantiate and use `ResolverMatch` objects. These methods are central to URL resolving and thus critical for implementing the necessary changes.",
