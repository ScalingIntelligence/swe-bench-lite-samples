Specifically, when a partial function is passed as the view, the __repr__ method does not reveal the underlying function or arguments provided by the partial function. Therefore, the issue suggests that it would be beneficial to unwrap the functools.partial objects in the ResolverMatch.__init__ method.\n\nI then reviewed the current file context which includes the ResolverMatch class definition and its __init__ and __repr__ methods. It was noted that the current __repr__ method only shows the func argument as functools.partial which does not provide helpful information about the underlying function or arguments.\n\nNext, I processed the new search results. I focused on the ResolverMatch class within the django/urls/resolvers.py file to identify relevant code spans. The __init__ method initializes various attributes and determines the _func_path, but it does not currently handle unwrapping partial functions. This is crucial since the issue at hand requires modifications to the '__init__' method to unwrap partial functions effectively.\n\nGiven this analysis, I decided to select the ResolverMatch class's entirety because the relevance of handling partial functions affects the entire class, particularly the '__init__' and '__repr__' methods, which are critical for addressing the issue.",

The current implementation in `ResolverMatch.__init__` and `ResolverMatch.__repr__` does not handle `functools.partial` objects specifically. To address this, the `ResolverMatch.__init__` method should be modified to unwrap `functools.partial` objects, and the `__repr__` method should be updated accordingly. The provided search results include the relevant code spans for `ResolverMatch.__init__` and `ResolverMatch.__repr__`, which need to be updated. Additionally, the `URLPattern.resolve` and `URLResolver.resolve` methods could involve instances of `ResolverMatch`, but they do not need direct modification for this specific issue.
