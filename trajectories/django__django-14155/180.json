The __repr__ method currently provides a representation of the func parameter, but it doesn't specifically handle functools.partial objects, which is the main concern of the issue. An adjustment involves detecting when func is an instance of functools.partial and then extracting and displaying its component properties such as func.func (wrapping function) and func.args or func.keywords. Given this, the presence of ResolverMatch and an established method to review its functionality aligns with efforts to resolve the issue at hand.

Given the context and search results, the main focus is on the ResolverMatch class in the resolvers.py file. The relevant code spans include the __init__ and __repr__ methods of the ResolverMatch class. These methods are crucial for understanding and implementing the proposed changes to handle partial functions better. Additionally, the URLPattern and URLResolver classes are mentioned indirectly as they utilize ResolverMatch and could be affected by the changes.

Specifically, when a partial function is passed as the view, the repr shows the func argument as `functools.partial` which doesn't reveal the underlying function or arguments provided. The suggestion is to unwrap `functools.partial` objects in `ResolverMatch.__init__()`. \n\nIn the current file context, the `ResolverMatch.__init__()` and `ResolverMatch.__repr__()` methods are already present. However, there is no specific handling for `functools.partial` objects within these methods.\n\nIn the new search results, the `ResolverMatch` class is again present, along with related methods such as `URLPattern.lookup_str`, which specifically handles the `functools.partial` type to retrieve the underlying function. This method could potentially be used as a reference for how to handle partial functions within `ResolverMatch.__init__()`.\n\nThe `URLPattern.lookup_str` property directly addresses the issue by checking if the callback is an instance of `functools.partial` and then using its `func` attribute to retrieve the underlying function. This pattern should be implemented in `ResolverMatch` to handle partial functions better.\n\nBefore making a decision on relevance and completeness, it's important to review all code in sections, not just isolated spans, to ensure a complete understanding and to identify any references to other parts of the codebase.",
