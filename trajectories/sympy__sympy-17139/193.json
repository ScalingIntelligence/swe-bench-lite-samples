It checks if the exponent of the expression is less than 0, which leads to the complex comparison error.\n- The 'TR5' and 'TR6' spans show the functions `TR5` and `TR6` respectively, which call `_TR56` with different trigonometric functions, making them relevant for the reported issue since `TR6` is directly involved in the traceback.\n- The 'TR15', 'TR16', and 'TR22' spans contain similar trigonometric simplification functions with different base functions, suggesting they might also handle complex numbers and could potentially have similar issues.\n\nBased on the traceback and context, the relevant code spans are in the '_TR56', 'TR5', 'TR6', 'TR15', 'TR16', and 'TR22' functions.
