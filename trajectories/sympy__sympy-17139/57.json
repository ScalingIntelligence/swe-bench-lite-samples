This indicates that the code is trying to compare the exponent of a Power object, which in this case is complex 'I', leading to an invalid comparison. In the provided search results, the '_TR56' function is indeed present, containing the problematic line. Other related functions 'TR5', 'TR6', 'TR15', 'TR16', and 'TR22' which call '_TR56' are also present, but the critical part for addressing the issue is within '_TR56'. Therefore, the relevant code span to address this issue is the '_TR56' function, specifically the line where the comparison is made.
