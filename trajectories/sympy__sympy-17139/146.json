Searching through the provided code spans, the relevant functions and comparisons are found in the 'fu.py' file, particularly in the 'TR6' and '_TR56' functions, where the comparison operation ('if (rv.exp < 0) == True:') that raises the TypeError is located. Additionally, the 'trigsimp' and 'futrig' functions from 'trigsimp.py' are involved in the simplification process, which indirectly leads to the problematic comparison in 'fu.py'.
