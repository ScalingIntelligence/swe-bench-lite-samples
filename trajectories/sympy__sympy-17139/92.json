However, these functions have been primarily tuned for real-valued operations but haven't been explicitly tested for handling complex exponents.

Lastly, TR22 applies '_TR56' to both cot and tan for transformation. Since the error about complex number comparison can occur in these scenarios, we can infer that '_TR56' should be examined and perhaps corrected for handling complex exponents and avoid such invalid comparisons.

In TR5 and TR6, '_TR56' facilitates the simplification of trigonometric expressions involving sin and cos functions. However, these functions have been primarily tuned for real-valued operations but haven't been explicitly tested for handling complex exponents. Similarly, TR15 and TR16 involve '_TR56' in the context of cot and tan functions, indicating it as a potential point to check for complex number correctness. Lastly, TR22 applies '_TR56' to both cot and tan for transformation. Since the error about complex number comparison can occur in these scenarios, we can infer that '_TR56' should be examined and perhaps corrected for handling complex exponents and avoid such invalid comparisons. It's crucial to design each function (TR5 to TR22) that interfaces with '_TR56' to handle such edge cases, delving deeper into complex number handling.",
