The traceback provided leads directly to the comparison in the `_f` function within `fu.py`, specifically looking at the `rv.exp < 0` condition. The issue is triggered during the simplification process, particularly within trigonometric simplification functions. Reviewing the search results, the file `sympy/simplify/fu.py` contains several relevant code spans such as 'TR6', 'TR10i', and 'TR11', which are all involved in trigonometric simplification. However, the key span is '_TR56' which directly relates to the error (line broken down in '_f' function). Additionally, `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` contains functions ('exptrigsimp', '_trigpats') that might be related at a higher level to the simplification process where `fu.py` is called.
