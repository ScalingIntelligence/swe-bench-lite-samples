The traceback indicates that the error occurs within the 'simplify' function when attempting to use 'trigsimp' and more specifically when applying '_futrig' and 'TR6' in the 'fu.py' file. The key points in the reported issue are the invalid comparison of complex 'I' and the handling of trigonometric simplifications. In the provided search results, the relevant code spans are within the 'fu.py' file, specifically the '_TR56' function, which contains the comparison that leads to the error. This function is responsible for handling specific trigonometric simplification rules, and the comparison 'if (rv.exp < 0) == True:' is directly relevant to the reported issue as it involves the exponent of a trigonometric function which can be complex. Therefore, the identified relevant code spans are the '_TR56' function and its usage in the 'TR6' function, which is directly called in the 'simplify' function as per the traceback. These spans should be enough to address the reported issue by allowing for a review and potential modification of the comparison logic to handle complex numbers appropriately.",
