I then examined the current file context provided for 'fu.py' where the traceback shows '_TR56' to be the source of the error. In the new search results, the 'simplify' function in 'simplify.py' is relevant as it calls 'trigsimp', which triggers further simplification involving the trig simplification functions. Also relevant is 'trigsimp' in 'trigsimp.py', as it uses 'futrig' which activates lower-level trigonometric simplification functions potentially impacting the error. The 'Expr' class in 'expr.py' with its simplification methods like 'simplify' and 'trigsimp' also displayed relevance for context, albeit its method definitions suggestions without innovation that directly affect the issue.
