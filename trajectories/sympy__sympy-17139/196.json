This suggests that either the search parameters need refinement, or the relevant context for the error is not fully captured in the provided code spans. To find additional relevant code spans, it would be beneficial to broaden the search to include other parts of the codebase that could influence the handling of complex numbers in trigonometric simplification. This might involve manual code review of functions and modules related to complex arithmetic, trigonometric functions, and simplification strategies. Additionally, examining the broader context in which complex numbers are generated or manipulated could provide crucial insight into the source of the invalid comparison.",

The current search results provide more context around the functions and comparison methods in the Expr class from expr.py, which is crucial for understanding how the comparison is handled for complex numbers. The _TR56 function and its internal _f function are particularly relevant as they contain the code causing the error. Additionally, the Expr class methods for comparison (__lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__) are significant because they raise the TypeError when attempting to compare complex numbers. These methods are found in the search results under the expr.py file. The sympify function in sympify.py and the factor_terms function in exprtools.py might also be relevant for understanding the broader context of the simplify function, but they don't directly contribute to the issue at hand. Therefore, the identified spans in fu.py and expr.py should be sufficient to address the issue, confirming the completeness of the search.",
