The key part of the traceback is: `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:`, which raises the `TypeError: Invalid comparison of complex I`. The current file context already provides the relevant functions `_TR56`, `TR5`, and `TR6` from `sympy/simplify/fu.py`. The new search results include additional functions from `fu.py` such as `TR3`, `TR9`, `TR10i`, `TR11`, `TR12i`, `TR15`, and `TR22`, which might provide more context or be directly involved in the simplification process. However, none of these new functions directly address the comparison issue of complex I. Given the traceback, it is clear that the problematic line is within the `_TR56` function in `sympy/simplify/fu.py`. Therefore, the task here is to focus on this function and ensure any comparisons involving complex numbers are handled appropriately to avoid such errors.

The error occurs in the comparison of complex numbers during the simplification process in the simplify function within the fu.py module. From the file context and the search results, the key function triggering the error is _TR56 in the fu.py module. This function performs a transformation on trigonometric expressions, and it contains a comparison that fails due to the presence of the complex number I. The search results confirm the presence of the _TR56 function and its usage in simplifying trigonometric expressions, specifically in functions like TR5 and TR6. These functions are critical in the simplification process for trigonometric functions, as indicated by their presence in the fu.py module. The key code span that needs correction is identified as the comparison involving rv.exp in the _TR56 function. Additional sections within the fu.py module, such as the TR12i function, also involve trigonometric simplification and might offer insights or similar handling of complex expressions that could be relevant for resolving this issue.",
