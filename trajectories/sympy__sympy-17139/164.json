The code spans provided in the search results include the full implementation of the `simplify` function, which is closely related to the reported issue because it directly processes the expression that leads to the error. The `simplify` function calls various simplification methods, including `trigsimp`, which might be involved in the erroneous comparison. Given the context, the provided code spans are relevant because they show the chain of function calls and the overall structure of the `simplify` function that handles the input expression before the error occurs. The presence of `trigsimp` in the `simplify` function suggests it might be involved in the simplification chain leading to the error. Further investigation is needed into the specific conditions under which `trigsimp` or other functions called within `simplify` interact with complex exponents to determine if they handle such cases correctly.
