The error is triggered specifically in the line `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` within the `_f` function in `fu.py`. To resolve this, we need to investigate the `TR6` function and its related functions in `fu.py` and ensure proper handling of complex numbers.

The traceback reveals that the error occurs in the `_f` function within the `_TR56` function in the `fu.py` file, specifically when comparing `rv.exp < 0`. Given this, the most relevant part of the codebase seems to be the `_TR56` function and its helper function `_f`, which are located in the `fu.py` file. Additionally, the `trigsimp.py` file contains the `futrig` and `_futrig` functions which call upon the trigonometric simplification functions, making it also relevant for the context of the error.\n\nFrom the search results, it is clear that both `fu.py` and `trigsimp.py` contain the functions directly related to the error. The `fu.py` file includes `TR6` and `_TR56` functions which are involved in the trigonometric simplification and are directly linked to the error in the `_f` function. The `trigsimp.py` file includes `futrig` and `_futrig` which are higher-level functions that use the simplified trigonometric functions, making them contextually relevant to the error.\n\nTherefore, the identified spans are the `_TR56` and `TR6` functions from `fu.py`, and the `futrig` and `_futrig` functions from `trigsimp.py`, as they directly pertain to the functionality that triggers the error.",

This function calls the _TR56 function which contains the line that results in the comparison error when substituting rv.exp into (-inf, max]. Modifying the line (rv.exp < 0) == True within the function _f in _TR56 would probably fix the issue by allowing comparison to complex numbers if rv.exp is a complex number without facing any errors. TR6 specifically deals with problematic expressions related to exp, sin, and cos combinations, so the given error could be due to the expression cos(x)**I fitting within TR6's operand scope. Thus, the code context is relevant, and we can conclude that TR6 needs to consider type checks or special treatment for expressions involving complex numbers, including comparisons of their powers' exponents, prior to proceeding with any computational efforts. The existence of TR6 in conjunction with similarly named TR1-TR14 within fu.py (and wrapped inside the trigsimp() function in trigsimp.py) confirms the context as a concerted mission that directs consolidation. Specifically, fortifying type awareness among TR functions via 'check types / exceptions before comparing' enhancements, and examples from Internet code support adding filter variations into _TR56, effects resolution plausible in modular infrastructure.

This line is attempting to compare the exponent of a trigonometric expression, which is causing the TypeError due to the invalid comparison of a complex number.
