The traceback suggests that the error occurs in the file 'fu.py' specifically in the function _f within the _TR56 function.

Given this, the search results should focus on the relevant code spans in the 'fu.py' file that handle the comparison of complex numbers or deal with the trigonometric simplification functions.\n\nAnalyzing the search results in 'fu.py', the key spans are:\n- 'TR2i' which involves trigonometric simplification in a multiplication.\n- 'TR3' which is a bottom-up simplification of trigonometric functions.\n- 'TR8' which handles specific cases of trigonometric multiplications including powers of trigonometric functions.\n- 'TR10i' which involves more complex trigonometric splits and checks on the addition of trigonometric functions.\n- 'TR11' and 'TR12i' which handle specific scenarios involving power reductions and factorization respectively of trigonometric expressions.\n- 'TRmorrie' and 'TR14' which deal with multiplication and power reductions of cosines, sines, and their combinations.\n- 'TRpower' which directly deals with the power reduction of trigonometric functions.\n\nAmong these, the most relevant span to the reported issue is 'TRpower' as it directly addresses the power reduction of trigonometric functions, which is an immediate context to the error involving 'cos(x)**I'.

The specific error occurs at this line: 'if (rv.exp < 0) == True:', which is found in the '_TR56' function within the 'fu.py' file. This suggests that the '_TR56' function is directly involved in the operation that leads to the error. The traceback indicates that the error arises from an invalid comparison of a complex number, highlighting a potential issue in the way complex numbers are handled or compared within the '_TR56' function. Given this context, the relevant code spans include the '_TR56' function, as well as other related functions like 'TR6' which directly call '_TR56' and could potentially contend with similar issues. Since the error pertains to complex numbers, it would be prudent to review operations involving complex numbers within these code spans. Additionally, considering the broader context of the 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' file, exploring other functions that might interact with complex numbers or trigonometric simplifications could provide further insights or potential fixes to avoid invalid comparisons. Despite finding relevant code spans, further examination might still be warranted to ensure all possible interactions involving complex numbers and the specific trigonometric simplification process are addressed. This could entail a broader review of the 'fu.py' file or related modules that collaborate in this functionality.",
