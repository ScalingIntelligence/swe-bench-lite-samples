The stack trace indicates that the error is triggered in the `simplify` function, which calls `trigsimp`, which in turn uses functions from `fu.py` like `TR6`. It's likely that the issue lies in how complex numbers are handled or compared within these simplification functions.",

This comparison is problematic when `rv.exp` is complex, which aligns with the issue of comparing the imaginary unit I. In the provided search results, we can find the relevant code span in `_TR56` within the fu.py file.
