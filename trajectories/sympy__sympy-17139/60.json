The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the 'trysimple' function within the 'fu.py' module. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to identify the code responsible for the comparison and ensure that such comparisons are handled appropriately, especially when dealing with complex numbers.\n\nThe search results include several potential relevant files and code spans, specifically:\n1. 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' contains the 'simplify' function which is involved in the traceback.\n2. 'sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py' contains functions related to complex number operations.\n3. 'sympy/functions/special/error_functions.py' contains functions that might interact with complex numbers indirectly.\n\nGiven the traceback details, the focus should be on 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py' where the 'simplify' function operates and where the error could be originating from. The '_f' function within 'sympy/simplify/fu.py' appears to contain the problematic comparison, as indicated by the traceback. Therefore, examining the '_f' function in the search results for any comparison involving complex numbers is crucial. Additionally, considering the broader context within 'sympy/simplify/simplify.py', particularly the 'simplify' function's interaction with other simplification routines, such as 'trigsimp', 'futrig', and others mentioned in the traceback, might provide additional insights into where the issue might be occurring or being propagated.",
