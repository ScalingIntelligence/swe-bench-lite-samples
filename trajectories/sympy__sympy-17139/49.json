The stack trace points to a specific location in the `fu.py` file where the comparison is taking place.

Additionally, `trigsimp.py` is mentioned in the trace, indicating a connection to trigonometric simplification. The root cause might be the handling of complex numbers or trigonometric expressions in these files.

The traceback points to the specific line in the sympy/simplify/fu.py file where the comparison is made. Additionally, the traceback shows that the exception is raised in the `__lt__` method of sympy/core/expr.py. To resolve the issue, the following steps are needed: 1. Identify the code spans in sympy/simplify/fu.py that are responsible for the comparison and potential handling of complex numbers. 2. Consider relevant imports and initializations at the beginning of the file which might influence how complex numbers are processed. 3. Examine the function `_TR56` within sympy/simplify/fu.py since it is directly involved in the simplification process and uses the less-than comparison likely related to the issue. Given the detailed traceback, focusing on code spans related to comparisons and manipulations of complex numbers in the `_TR56` function and its dependencies is crucial. Furthermore, cross-referencing with additional imports and functions from other spans within the same file could provide a comprehensive context for a more effective resolution.",
