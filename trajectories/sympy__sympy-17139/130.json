The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the _f function within the TR6 transformation in the sympy/simplify/fu.py file. This function attempts to compare the exponent of a trigonometric expression with 0, which raises a TypeError due to invalid complex comparison. The search results include several code spans from fu.py that involve trigonometric simplification functions, including TR6 and _TR56, which are directly related to the error location. Additionally, spans from trigsimp.py are relevant as they show the integration and use of fu functions for trigonometric simplification.
