The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `_TR56` function within the `fu.py` file when checking the condition `if (rv.exp < 0) == True:` where `rv.exp` is a complex number. Given the context, it's clear that the problematic code span is within the `_TR56` function, specifically the line that performs the comparison. This section of the code is responsible for handling mathematical expressions involving trigonometric functions and performs checks on the exponent of a power expression. The comparison `rv.exp < 0` is not valid for complex numbers, which leads to the TypeError. The search results show the relevant code spans including the imports, and the definitions of `_TR56`, `TR5`, `TR6`, `TR15`, `TR16`, and `TR22`.

The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the TR6 function inside the fu.py file. Specifically, the error is triggered in the _TR56 function where there is a comparison (rv.exp < 0) which is invalid for complex I. The current file context has already identified relevant sections in fu.py including _TR56, TR5, and TR6. The search results expand on this context with additional functions in fu.py such as TR0, TR2i, TR10i, and others. None of these additional functions directly relate to the comparison issue in _TR56. Therefore, the identified spans in fu.py are still the most relevant to the issue.\n\nSince the error involves complex I and invalid comparisons, additional relevance can be attributed to the complexes.py file from the search results, particularly the sections related to complex functions handling, although they do not directly relate to the observed error point in fu.py. Additionally, the simplify function in the simplify.py file is indirectly relevant as it is the entry point for the issue, and it calls various simplification tools including those in trigsimp.py which may utilize functions from fu.py.
