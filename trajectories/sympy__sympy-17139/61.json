The traceback leads to the function _TR56 in the file 'sympy/simplify/fu.py'. The key part of the error occurs in the comparison 'rv.exp < 0', which raises a TypeError for complex comparisons. Given this context, the focus should be on the relevant section of the code that handles these types of comparisons and expressions. The search results provide several relevant functions from the 'fu.py' file, including '_TR56', 'TR5', 'TR6', 'TR15', 'TR16', and 'TR22'. These functions are involved in simplifying trigonometric expressions using various transformations. Given the nature of the issue, the critical span is '_TR56', which contains the expression 'rv.exp < 0' that triggers the error when 'rv.exp' is complex.\n\nMy analysis suggests that the relevant code spans are those that deal with the comparison of complex numbers or the handling of exponents in trigonometric simplification functions. The '_TR56' function is central as it directly involves the problematic comparison. Additionally, the other functions ('TR5', 'TR6', 'TR15', 'TR16', and 'TR22') may also be relevant as they make calls to '_TR56' and could potentially expose similar issues depending on the expression they are simplifying.",
