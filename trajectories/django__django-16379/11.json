This method is used to check if a cache key exists and is not expired. The problem arises because there is an interval between checking if the file exists and actually opening it, during which the file could be deleted. Additionally, the '_is_expired' method might itself delete the file if it finds it to be expired. Focusing the search on the `FileBasedCache` class and the `has_key` method will be crucial to address this issue.",

This race condition is especially problematic if multiple threads are attempting to read an expired cache file simultaneously, as the `_is_expired()` method could delete the file under these circumstances. Given the detailed description in the issue, the focus should be on identifying the exact span of code in the `FileBasedCache.has_key` method. Additionally, while not directly mentioned in the issue, it could be beneficial to look for any related methods like `_is_expired()` or other file management operations in the same file to understand the full extent of potential race conditions.
