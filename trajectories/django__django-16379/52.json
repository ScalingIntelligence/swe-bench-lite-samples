Given the context of the issue, the relevant code spans to focus on are those related to `has_key`, `_is_expired`, and the file manipulation methods such as `delete`. The search results do provide the `has_key` method, which is critical, but also related methods like `delete` and `_delete` should be examined as they could contribute to the race condition described. The `touch` method, while not directly mentioned, is also relevant because it involves file manipulation and could affect the issue being discussed.",
