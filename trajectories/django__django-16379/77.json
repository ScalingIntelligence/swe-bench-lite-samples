This is especially problematic since the `_is_expired` method, which is called after opening the file, may delete it if the cache entry is expired. From the search results, it's apparent that the relevant code spans are within the `FileBasedCache` class, specifically in the `has_key` method, the `_delete` method, and potentially the `_is_expired` method (not seen in the search results but inferred from the issue description). These methods are critical as they involve file operations that could lead to the described race condition. Given the current search results, identifying the specific code spans involved in these methods will help in addressing the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to be identified are those related to the `has_key` and `_delete` methods.",
