This is particularly problematic when multiple threads attempt to access an expired cache file, as the _is_expired() method can delete the file, leading to the FileNotFoundError. To address this, we need to focus on the implementation of `has_key` in the FileBasedCache class and any related methods that might be involved in file deletion upon expiration. These methods include `_is_expired`, `add`, and potentially the base class methods in `BaseCache`.",

Furthermore, the `_is_expired` method, which reads the expiration timestamp from the file, can itself delete the file if it finds that the cache entry is expired. Both methods thus bear the risk of file operations that could lead to race conditions.

There's a critical window between the `os.path.exists` check and the `open` call where the file can be deleted, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. The context provided already highlights the relevant parts of the `FileBasedCache` class, particularly the `has_key` method and the `_is_expired` method which can delete the file if it's expired. Further analysis of the new search results reveals additional methods (`add`, `set`, and `delete`) in the `FileBasedCache` class that might interact with the `has_key` method. This confirms that the identified spans are indeed related to the issue at hand, particularly the part where `add` method uses `has_key` before setting the cache, and `_is_expired` could delete the file, making it susceptible to race conditions. This analysis confirms that the provided spans are relevant and sufficient to address the reported issue.",
