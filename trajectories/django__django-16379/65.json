To address this, we need to locate the `has_key` method and the associated `_is_expired` method in the `FileBasedCache` class.

The analysis of the search results shows that the has_key method checks if a file exists using os.path.exists(fname) and then attempts to open it. However, between these two operations, the file might be deleted, particularly if another thread or process determines it is expired and deletes it. This scenario is evident in the code provided for the has_key method and the _delete method, which confirms the possibility of such race conditions. To address this issue, looking at the has_key method in detail and understanding how it interacts with other methods like _delete is crucial. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue include the has_key method, the _delete method, and potentially the touch and delete methods which also interact with file handling.",

In fact, the _is_expired() method itself deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. So if many threads race to read an expired cache at once, it's not that unlikely to hit this window.\n"
