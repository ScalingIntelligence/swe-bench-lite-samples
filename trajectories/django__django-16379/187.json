The search results reveal the entire implementation of the FileBasedCache class, including the problematic has_key method, as well as related methods like touch, delete, and _delete. These methods are relevant because they deal with file operations and could contribute to or be affected by the race condition. By understanding the entire context of these methods, we can better assess the overall role they play in the cache system, which is crucial for fixing the issue.",
