The specific concern is that between checking if a file exists and trying to open it, it's possible for the file to be deleted, which would raise a FileNotFoundError. This can occur if multiple threads attempt to access an expired cache simultaneously. The provided search results contain four relevant spans within the 'django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py' file. The spans include the entire FileBasedCache class, the has_key method, and the _is_expired method. The has_key method directly relates to the reported issue as it checks for the existence of a cache file and attempts to open it. The _is_expired method is also relevant because it handles the expiration of cache files, potentially deleting them under race conditions, which aligns with the issue description. Therefore, these three spans are identified as relevant to the issue.",
