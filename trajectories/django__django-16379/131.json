The issue arises from the window of time between checking if a file exists and attempting to open it, during which the file could be deleted. This can occur when multiple threads are trying to access an expired cache item. The provided search results contain the relevant 'has_key' method and also introduce new methods like 'touch', 'delete', and '_delete' that manage file operations. These methods are likely relevant because they show how file operations are handled in the cache system, potentially addressing or interacting with the race condition mentioned in the issue. Specifically, the '_is_expired' method within 'has_key' could be responsible for deleting expired files, which directly relates to the race condition. By identifying these methods, we can understand the flow better and see where modifications might need to be made to prevent the race condition.",
