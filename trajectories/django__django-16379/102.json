This method checks if a file exists and subsequently attempts to open it, but there's a window where the file could be deleted between these two actions. The problem is exacerbated by the `_is_expired` method, which can delete the file if it finds it to be expired, potentially leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. The `has_key` method, `_is_expired`, and related methods in the `FileBasedCache` class should be examined to address this race condition. The relevant code spans include the definition of `FileBasedCache` and its methods such as `has_key`, `touch`, `delete`, and `_delete` since these directly deal with file operations that could be affected by the race condition.",

In fact, the _is_expired() method itself deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. So if many threads race to read an expired cache at once, it's not that unlikely to hit this window.\n"
