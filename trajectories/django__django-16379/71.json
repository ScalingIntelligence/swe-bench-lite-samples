The relevant files to investigate are those that contain the `FileBasedCache` class and any related methods that might handle file existence checks and deletions. The `django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py` file is already identified, which contains the `FileBasedCache` class and the problematic `has_key` method.

The issue describes a scenario where a FileNotFoundError occurs because the file can be deleted between the 'exists()' check and the 'open()' operation. This vulnerability is explicitly described in the 'has_key' method provided in the search results. Therefore, the relevant code spans should also include any related methods or variables that could contribute to this race condition or could be modified to prevent it. \n\nThe 'has_key' method definition in the search results directly corresponds to the vulnerability described in the issue. It checks if a file exists and then attempts to open it, which is exactly where the race condition can occur. It is evident from the code that the method '_is_expired()' could potentially delete the file if it finds it to be expired. This method, although not provided in the search results, is indirectly referenced as the cause of the file deletion, thus reinforcing the relevance of the 'has_key' method in addressing the issue.",
