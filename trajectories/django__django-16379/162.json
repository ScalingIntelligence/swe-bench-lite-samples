The specific method causing the problem is `has_key`, which checks for the existence of a cache file and then attempts to open it. Between these two operations, the file can be deleted, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. This is exacerbated by the fact that the `_is_expired` method can delete the file if it finds it to be expired. To diagnose and fix this, we need to focus on the `FileBasedCache` class and the `has_key` method, potentially including other related methods like `_is_expired` and `_key_to_file`. Additionally, it's worth looking into any other methods that interact with these files to ensure they handle such race conditions.",

This method checks if a cache file exists before trying to open it. The problem arises because between the `os.path.exists(fname)` check and the `with open(fname, \"rb\") as f:` statement, the file might be deleted, especially since the `_is_expired` method itself deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. This could lead to a `FileNotFoundError` if multiple threads are racing to read an expired cache at the same time.\n\nThe `search_results` section contains the relevant code span for the `has_key` method, as well as the `_key_to_file` and `_is_expired` methods, which are directly related to the issue. The `_key_to_file` method is responsible for translating cache keys into file paths, and the `_is_expired` method checks if a cache file is expired and deletes it if it is. These three methods together provide the complete context for understanding and addressing the race condition issue.",
