Additionally, the file context provides the _is_expired method, which is crucial for understanding how file checks for expiration and deletions are managed. With this information, it is evident that the method _is_expired does indeed delete the file if it finds it to be expired, which can lead to the race condition described. The complete context needed to understand and address the race condition in the has_key method is present in the provided file context.",
