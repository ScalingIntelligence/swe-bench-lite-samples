The key point is that between the 'os.path.exists(fname)' check and the 'open(fname, \"rb\")' call, the file might be deleted, leading to a 'FileNotFoundError'. This is especially critical if multiple threads race to read an expired cache simultaneously, as the '_is_expired()' method could delete the file if it finds it expired. The search results include the entire FileBasedCache class with several methods, including '__init__', 'touch', 'delete', '_delete', and 'has_key'. The 'has_key' method exactly matches the description in the issue, and understanding the whole context of the class is crucial to accurately address the race condition. No other parts of the codebase are referenced directly in this section. Given the context, the relevant code spans are those directly involved in the 'has_key' method and its related operations to ensure a comprehensive understanding and potential fixes.",
