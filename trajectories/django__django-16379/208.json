This is exacerbated by the _is_expired method, which deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. I identified several key spans of code: the FileBasedCache class definition and its methods __init__, has_key, and _is_expired. All these are relevant because the has_key method is where the vulnerability lies, and _is_expired is directly involved in triggering the race condition by deleting the file. The __init__ method is relevant as it sets up the cache directory.",
