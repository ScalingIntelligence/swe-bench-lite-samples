The specific concern is that between checking if a file exists and opening it, the file could be deleted, leading to a FileNotFoundError. This can happen particularly when multiple threads race to read an expired cache file, as the _is_expired() method itself deletes the file if it finds it to be expired.\n\nReviewing the search results, I focus on the 'FileBasedCache' class and its methods. The 'has_key' method is directly related to the issue, as it performs the file existence check and the file open operation that are susceptible to the described race condition. The '_delete' method, responsible for deleting cache files, could also be a part of the solution or related to the issue, as it deals with file deletion.\n\nGiven these details, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue would include the 'has_key' method and possibly the '_delete' method, as understanding file deletion behavior may aid in resolving the race condition.",
