This method checks if a cache file exists and then attempts to open it. However, between the 'exists' check and the 'open' operation, the file could be deleted, leading to a FileNotFoundError. Additionally, the '_is_expired' method can delete files, exacerbating this race condition. The provided search results include the relevant code for the FileBasedCache class, specifically the 'has_key' method, as well as related methods like 'touch', 'delete', and '_delete'. These methods are all part of the cache management process and are thus relevant to the issue. The 'touch' method demonstrates an approach to handle file access with a lock to prevent race conditions, which could be considered as a potential solution for the 'has_key' method. Therefore, the identified code spans are crucial to addressing the reported issue.",
