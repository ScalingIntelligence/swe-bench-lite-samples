The problem occurs between the `os.path.exists()` check and the `open()` call, where the file could be deleted by another thread after the check but before the file is opened. This can result in a `FileNotFoundError`. To address this, we need to investigate the `FileBasedCache` class and the `has_key` method in the `django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py` file. Additionally, we should look into the `_is_expired` method, which could potentially delete the file, exacerbating the race condition.",

The specific concern is that if multiple threads attempt to read an expired cache file simultaneously, it is possible for a thread to encounter a `FileNotFoundError` between the `os.path.exists` check and the `open` call. This race condition can occur because the `_is_expired` method deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. Upon reviewing the search results, the code spans identified as relevant include the `FileBasedCache` class definition, the `has_key` method, and the `_is_expired` method. These code spans directly correspond to the issue described, especially focusing on the critical section where the race condition can occur. Therefore, these spans should be further investigated and potentially modified to handle the race condition.",

In fact, the _is_expired() method itself deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. So if many threads race to read an expired cache at once, it's not that unlikely to hit this window.\n"
