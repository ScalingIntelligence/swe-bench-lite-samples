The problem occurs when multiple threads attempt to access or delete the same cache file simultaneously, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. Specifically, the race condition window is between the `os.path.exists(fname)` check and the `with open(fname, 'rb') as f:` operation. The provided search results offer key insights into the relevant portions of the codebase. The `FileBasedCache.has_key` method directly relates to the issue and demonstrates the specific code block where the race condition arises. Additionally, the `FileBasedCache._is_expired` method is implicated since it deletes the file when determining if it has expired, potentially causing the conflict if multiple threads concurrently check the same file. Therefore, it is crucial to identify all these spans as the first set of relevant code blocks to resolve the issue.",
