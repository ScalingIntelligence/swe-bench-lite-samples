The problem occurs specifically when checking if a cache key exists using os.path.exists() and then attempting to open the file. The window between these two operations can lead to a FileNotFoundError if the file is deleted concurrently. Considering the provided context, it's clear that the problematic code resides within the FileBasedCache class in django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py. This class contains the has_key method that performs the aforementioned unsafe operations. A detailed search focusing on this class and method should uncover the exact lines of code responsible for the race condition.",
