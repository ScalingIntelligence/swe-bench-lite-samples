The specific problem occurs when multiple threads or processes check if a cache file exists and then try to open it. If the file is deleted during this process, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised. To address this, we need to focus on the `FileBasedCache` class and its `has_key` method. We should also look into the `_is_expired` method as it may also be involved in the deletion of the file, contributing to the race condition. Our search should target these specific parts of the Django cache backends to find the relevant code.",

This is evident in the has_key method where the file is checked for existence before being opened. Additionally, there's a risk since the _is_expired method might delete the file if it's found to be expired. Given these observations, the relevant code spans include the has_key method which contains the problematic file check and open sequence, and the _is_expired method which manages the file deletion that could lead to the race condition. The __init__ method might also be relevant contextually as it initializes the cache directory. The FileBasedCache class itself provides the context and setup for these methods.",
