This race condition is exacerbated by the fact that the `_is_expired()` method itself deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. Given this context, I reviewed the provided search results focusing on the `FileBasedCache` class and its methods. The methods `has_key`, `touch`, `delete`, and `_delete` are directly relevant to handling file operations and cache management, which are central to the issue. The `has_key` method code span matches the description in the issue with the problematic exists-open sequence. The other methods (`touch`, `delete`, and `_delete`) are relevant because they involve file operations and cache expiration, which are intricately linked to the race condition. By examining all these methods, I ensured a comprehensive understanding of how file operations are handled in the cache, which is crucial for addressing the race condition effectively.",
