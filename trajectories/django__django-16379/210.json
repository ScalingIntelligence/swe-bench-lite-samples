The problem occurs due to a window where the file can be deleted between the `os.path.exists(fname)` check and the `open(fname, \"rb\")` operation. This can happen if multiple threads are attempting to access an expired cache file simultaneously. To address this, we need to focus on the `FileBasedCache` class and the `has_key` method, potentially looking for improvements or checks that can mitigate the race condition. Given the context provided, we should also consider the `_is_expired` method within the `FileBasedCache` class, as it is mentioned to delete files if they are found expired.",

Additional spans like `FileBasedCache.__init__` and static attributes (like `cache_suffix` and `pickle_protocol`) are part of the class definition but are currently not directly relevant to the specific issue of race conditions in `has_key`.",
