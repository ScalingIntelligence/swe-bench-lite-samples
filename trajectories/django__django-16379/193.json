Specifically, between the `os.path.exists(fname)` check and the `open(fname, \"rb\")` call, the file might be deleted, particularly by the `_is_expired()` method that deletes the file if it's expired. To address this, we should focus our search on the `FileBasedCache` class and specifically the `has_key` method, and also look into the `_is_expired` method since it triggers the file deletion. Additionally, we should ensure that all relevant files containing these methods are identified. File patterns should be set to restrict the search to Python files within the Django cache backends directory.",

The specific concern is that between the `os.path.exists(fname)` check and the `open(fname, \"rb\")` call, the file could be deleted, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. This is exacerbated by the `_is_expired` method which deletes the file if it is found to be expired. The search results provided contain the relevant code spans, including the `FileBasedCache` class definition, the __init__ method for context on how the class is initialized, the `has_key` method which is the focus of the issue, and the `_is_expired` method which contributes to the potential race condition. These code spans are directly relevant to understanding and addressing the reported issue. The analysis confirms that examining these spans is sufficient to comprehend the race condition context and identify where the fix needs to be applied.",
