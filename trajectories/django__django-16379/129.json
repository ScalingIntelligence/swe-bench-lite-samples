Given the context, it's clear that the problem is specific to the file-based cache implementation in Django. To resolve this, a search for the `FileBasedCache` class and its `has_key` method within the `django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py` file is necessary to identify the exact location of the code causing the issue.",

The provided search results include the exact implementation of 'has_key' method in the 'django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py' file.
