The relevant code spans identified in the search results are primarily within the `FileBasedCache` class, specifically the `has_key`, `_delete`, and `touch` methods. The `has_key` method is directly linked to the issue as it checks for file existence and attempts to open the file, vulnerable to the race condition described. The `_delete` method is crucial as it is responsible for file deletion, which can occur in the interim period. The `touch` method, although not directly causing the issue, is still relevant as it manipulates cache files and could potentially introduce similar race conditions in other scenarios. Together, these methods provide a comprehensive view of the file-based cache operations, allowing for a more informed analysis and potential fix for the race condition.",
