The specific method `has_key` in the `FileBasedCache` class checks if a cache file exists and then attempts to open it. However, between the `exists()` check and the `open()` call, the file can be deleted, leading to the error. The method `_is_expired` can also delete the file if it finds it to be expired. This race condition can be exacerbated by multiple threads trying to access an expired cache file simultaneously. To address this, the search should focus on the `FileBasedCache` class within the `django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py` file, particularly the `has_key` method and any related methods, such as `_is_expired` and `_key_to_file`.",
