The current context shows no previously identified relevant code, so all focus is on the new search results. The search results include various methods of the FileBasedCache class, but the most relevant sections are the has_key method, the _delete method which directly handles file deletion, and the touch method which interacts with the cache file.

This window of time could lead to a `FileNotFoundError` if the file is deleted by another thread or process. The existing code spans in the file context already touch on key methods related to file operations (`_delete`, `touch`, `_is_expired`), but none directly address the issue of synchronizing access to prevent the race condition. Reviewing the new search results, the relevant spans of code are those that deal with file operations and cache key checking, specifically the `has_key` method itself, which needs synchronization to avoid race conditions. Additionally, other relevant sections include `add`, `get`, `set`, and `delete` methods, as they also involve file operations. The `_is_expired` method is also relevant because it is responsible for file deletion, which exacerbates the race condition issue. Overall, the identified spans suggest that a synchronization mechanism is needed around file operations in the cache to prevent race conditions.",
