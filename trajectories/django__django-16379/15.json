The `FileBasedCache` class definition includes the `has_key`, `_key_to_file`, and `_is_expired` methods. The `has_key` method is directly involved in the race condition as described in the issue, performing a file check and an open operation. The `_key_to_file` method is used to generate the file name for the cache key, which is pivotal for the `has_key` method to function. The `_is_expired` method checks if the file is expired and deletes it if it is, which can lead to the file not being found during the open attempt in `has_key`, thus creating a race condition. All these spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
