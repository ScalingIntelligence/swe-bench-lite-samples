To address this, we need to focus our search on the FileBasedCache class within the filebased.py file, especially around the has_key method and its related functions.",

Specifically, the problem arises between the `os.path.exists(fname)` check and the `open(fname, \"rb\")` call, where the file might be deleted by another thread. Additionally, the `_is_expired` method can delete the file if it finds it to be expired. This situation can lead to a `FileNotFoundError`. \n\nLooking at the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant parts of the code are:\n1. The `has_key` method where the race condition occurs.\n2. The `_key_to_file` method which generates the file path.\n3. The `_is_expired` method which can delete the file if it's expired.\n\nThese methods are interconnected in a way that could potentially cause the issue described. Therefore, it's important to further investigate and possibly refactor these methods to avoid such race conditions.",
