This is particularly relevant in a multi-threaded environment where multiple threads might be handling the cache simultaneously. To address this, we need to locate the `has_key` method and possibly the `_is_expired` method in the `FileBasedCache` class to examine how the file operations are managed and to see if there are opportunities to introduce synchronization mechanisms or re-architect the method to avoid these race conditions.",

This means that multiple threads reading an expired cache simultaneously can lead to simultaneous deletion and subsequent `FileNotFoundError`.
