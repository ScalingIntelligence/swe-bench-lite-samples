Analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that all relevant methods involved are in the 'filebased.py' file. The 'has_key' method is the main focus, but also relevant are the 'touch', 'delete', and '_delete' methods, as they deal with file operations that could contribute to the race condition. Thus, all these spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

In fact, the _is_expired() method itself deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. So if many threads race to read an expired cache at once, it's not that unlikely to hit this window.\n"
