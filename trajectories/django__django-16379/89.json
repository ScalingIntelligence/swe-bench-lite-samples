This is particularly relevant given the _is_expired() method, which deletes the file if it's found to be expired. To address this, the search focused on the FileBasedCache class in the Django cache framework, specifically on methods related to file handling and key checking. The identified spans include the has_key method, as it directly relates to the issue, and other relevant methods like _delete and touch, as they handle file operations that could potentially interact with has_key during concurrent operations. Reviewing these methods helps ensure a fuller understanding of the potential race conditions and aids in formulating a comprehensive solution.",
