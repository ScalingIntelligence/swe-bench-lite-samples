This can happen because the `_is_expired` method deletes the file if it's found to be expired. The search results contain the relevant portions of the `FileBasedCache` class that need to be addressed to fix this race condition. Specifically, the `has_key` method and the `_is_expired` method are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue. Both methods are present in the search results, making them relevant to the reported issue.\n\nBy focusing on these methods, we can start identifying the specific parts of the code that need to be modified to avoid the race condition.
