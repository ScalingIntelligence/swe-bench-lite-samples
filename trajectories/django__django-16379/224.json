The issue specifically mentions the `FileNotFoundError` exception and the line numbers in the `filebased.py` file where the error occurs. The search results contain the relevant code spans: the `FileBasedCache` class definition, the `__init__` method, the `has_key` method, and the `_is_expired` method. The `has_key` method is the main focus as it contains the potential race condition. Additionally, the `_is_expired` method, which deletes the file if it is found to be expired, is also relevant as it contributes to the race condition scenario. Based on the reported issue and the search results, these code spans are identified as relevant to address the race condition issue in the `FileBasedCache` class.",
