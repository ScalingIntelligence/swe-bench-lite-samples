This deletion can happen due to the `_is_expired` method, which deletes the file if it is found to be expired. The current file context is empty, indicating that no relevant code has been identified yet. The search results include the `FileBasedCache` class with its methods `__init__`, `has_key`, and `_is_expired`. These methods are directly related to the issue reported, particularly the `has_key` and `_is_expired` methods, which demonstrate the race condition scenario. Therefore, all these code spans are relevant to the reported issue, and the search task can be considered complete with the identification of these code spans.",
