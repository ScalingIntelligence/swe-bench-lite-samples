The method performs an `os.path.exists` check to see if the cache file exists, and if it does, it attempts to open the file for reading. However, between these two operations, there's a window where the file could be deleted by another thread, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`. The issue is exacerbated by the `_is_expired` method, which itself can delete the file if it finds the cache to be expired. This race condition can be triggered more frequently when multiple threads race to read an expired cache. The search results provided include the relevant `FileBasedCache` class and its methods, specifically the `has_key` method as mentioned in the issue description. The identified spans include the `has_key`, `_delete`, and `touch` methods, which are directly or indirectly involved in handling cache file operations and thus susceptible to the race condition. Therefore, the identified spans are directly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
