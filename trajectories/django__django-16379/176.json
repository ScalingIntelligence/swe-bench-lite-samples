This method checks if a cached file exists and then attempts to open it. However, between the `os.path.exists(fname)` check and the `with open(fname, \"rb\") as f:` line, the file can be deleted, causing a `FileNotFoundError`. Specifically, the `_is_expired` method might delete the file if it finds it to be expired, leading to this condition. This suggests that the `has_key` method and possibly the `_is_expired` method, both in the `FileBasedCache` class, need to be examined for possible improvements to handle concurrent access and file deletion.",

The issue occurs due to a file being deleted between the 'os.path.exists(fname)' check and the 'with open(fname, \"rb\") as f:' statement in the 'has_key' method. This race condition can lead to a 'FileNotFoundError'. The provided search results contain the 'FileBasedCache' class with several methods including '__init__', 'touch', 'delete', '_delete', and 'has_key'. The 'has_key' method matches the exact code mentioned in the issue report, making it the most relevant part to address the problem of race conditions. Additionally, the '_delete' method, which is used for deleting cache files, also has a potential role in the race condition issue as it can delete files that are being checked in 'has_key'. Therefore, both 'has_key' and '_delete' methods are identified as relevant code spans.",
