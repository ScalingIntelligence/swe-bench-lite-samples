The issue occurs due to a window of time between checking for the file's existence with os.path.exists(fname) and opening the file with open(fname, \"rb\"). The _is_expired method can delete the file if it finds it to be expired, leading to a possible FileNotFoundError exception if multiple threads access an expired cache simultaneously.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans in the search results that should be examined further are those that directly relate to the has_key method and its interaction with method such as _delete or _is_expired that might modify the file. Specifically, the code spans around has_key implementation within FileBasedCache class are of interest and within _delete method that could be directly causing the races. These are the main areas in the provided search results where analysis should be concentrated to find resolution for the reported issue.\n\nFurthermore, regarding the search task completion, these relevant code spans should assist in building potential fixes or enhancements to eliminate the identified race condition in the cache implementation.",
