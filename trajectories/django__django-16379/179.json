The search results provide a detailed context of the FileBasedCache class, including other related methods like 'touch', 'delete', and '_delete'. However, the key method under scrutiny is 'has_key', which matches the description in the reported issue. Other methods like 'touch' and 'delete' might contribute to the race condition context, but the primary concern is the 'has_key' method. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those related to the 'has_key' method and any other methods that interact with it, such as '_is_expired' (if available in the full context).",
