The has_key method is susceptible to a situation where the file might be deleted between the os.path.exists(fname) check and the subsequent with open(fname, 'rb') as f: block. This race condition is exacerbated by the _is_expired method, which deletes the file if it is found to be expired. Given this understanding, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those defining the has_key and _is_expired methods in the FileBasedCache class. These methods need to be reviewed and possibly modified to handle the race condition more gracefully, potentially through the use of atomic operations or other concurrency control mechanisms.",
