The race condition arises due to the window between checking if a file exists and attempting to open it, during which the file could be deleted. This is particularly problematic in a multi-threaded environment where multiple threads might attempt to access or delete the cache file simultaneously. Given the context, it's crucial to focus on the `FileBasedCache` class and its methods, particularly `has_key`, and the `_is_expired` method which, if it finds a file to be expired, deletes it. Therefore, I will search specifically within the file `django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py` for the `FileBasedCache` class and the `has_key` method to identify the relevant code block.",
