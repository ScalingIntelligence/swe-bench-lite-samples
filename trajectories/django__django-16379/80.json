The race condition occurs due to the time window between checking if the file exists (using os.path.exists) and trying to open it. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the _is_expired method can delete the file if it finds the cache expired. Given this context, focusing on the FileBasedCache class and its has_key method, as well as any related methods like _is_expired, appears to be the most effective way to address the problem. There's no need for a file pattern or additional queries, as the exact location and method causing the issue are already known.",
