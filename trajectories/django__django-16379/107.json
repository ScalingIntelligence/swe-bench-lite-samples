This can happen when multiple threads attempt to access an expired cache file, which is then deleted by the `_is_expired` method. To resolve this, we need to focus on the `FileBasedCache` class and the `has_key` method, ensuring proper synchronization mechanisms are in place to avoid this race condition. Additionally, examining the `_is_expired` method to understand how it handles file deletions would be valuable.",
