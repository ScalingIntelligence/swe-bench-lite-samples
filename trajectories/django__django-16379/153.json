This race condition can occur particularly when multiple threads are attempting to access or delete an expired cache file simultaneously. The provided search results contain the relevant sections of the `FileBasedCache` class, specifically the `has_key`, `touch`, `delete`, and `_delete` methods. These methods are directly related to handling cache files and are likely where the race condition can occur. The `has_key` method is of particular importance as it contains the vulnerable code segment. Other methods like `touch` and `delete` are also relevant as they interact with the cache files and could contribute to the race condition issue. Identifying and addressing the race condition in the `has_key` method will involve adding some form of locking to ensure that the file existence check and file access operations are thread-safe. The `has_key` method should be the primary focus for addressing the race condition as it is explicitly mentioned in the reported issue and contains the code where the race condition occurs. The other methods (`touch` and `delete`) are relevant secondary context, especially `_delete` which is responsible for actually removing the cache file.",

In fact, the _is_expired() method itself deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. So if many threads race to read an expired cache at once, it's not that unlikely to hit this window.\n"
