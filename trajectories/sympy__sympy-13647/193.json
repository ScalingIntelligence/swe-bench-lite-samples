This suggests a potential problem in the implementation of the `col_insert()` method or the internal methods it relies on, such as `_eval_col_insert()`. Given the provided context, the focus is on the `MatrixShaping` class and its `col_insert()` method in the `sympy/matrices/common.py` file. The new search results include the `SparseMatrix` class and its `_eval_col_insert()` method in the `sympy/matrices/sparse.py` file. This additional context is crucial because it provides the implementation of `_eval_col_insert()` specific to the `SparseMatrix` class, which could be where the issue lies. The presence of similar methods across different matrix types (dense vs. sparse) suggests that the error might be specific to how sparse matrices handle insertion, or it could be a broader issue affecting all matrix types.
