The documentation states that if the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample. However, the example provided shows that the clustering returns [2] as cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as cluster labels, indicating that the user is not getting the expected results. The relevant code spans to look at would be the logic that handles the convergence or non-convergence condition within the `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class. In the provided code, the `fit` method calls the `affinity_propagation` function and then sets `self.cluster_centers_indices_` and `self.labels_` based on the result of this function call. Therefore, the `affinity_propagation` function, which is called within the `fit` method, is critical for determining how the non-convergence case is handled. Additionally, the `predict` method checks if `cluster_centers_` exists and if not, it labels every sample as '-1', which is in line with the expected behavior in case of non-convergence. The current code does not directly address the issue of checking for convergence before assigning the cluster center and labels. Therefore, the provided code spans are relevant to understand the current handling of non-convergence, but the issue might require modifications to the code to align with the documentation's description of non-convergence behavior.",

The user expects certain return values in such cases, which are not being met. This issue involves two main aspects: the handling of non-convergence cases and the correct behavior as per the documentation. From the search results, we have relevant code spans that define the AffinityPropagation class and its methods, as well as the affinity_propagation function which performs the actual clustering. This includes the fit and predict methods which are critical here: fit initializes and performs the clustering, and predict is used to determine cluster labels. The relevant sections for addressing the issue are those that handle non-convergence (such as where labels are set to -1 and cluster centers are empty) and those that interact with the verbose option for convergence checking. The user is seeking a more direct and automated way to detect non-convergence without relying on the verbose option or manual checks. The search results show that the non-convergence case sets labels to [-1] and cluster centers to [], which is partially in line with user expectations. However, additional code or a property to directly check convergence status might still be useful, as the existing method using self.n_iter_ and max_iter is considered a hack by the user.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
