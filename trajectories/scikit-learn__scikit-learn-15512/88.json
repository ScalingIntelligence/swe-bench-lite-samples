The user expects that when convergence does not occur, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the actual behavior observed is different. The user suggests that a property could be used to check if the clustering has converged, or to return -1 values directly to indicate non-convergence.\n\nThe provided code spans include the AffinityPropagation class definition and its methods, which are directly related to the reported issue. The fit method is particularly relevant as it handles the main logic of the AffinityPropagation algorithm, including the conditions for convergence. The predict method is also relevant as it deals with labeling samples based on the outcome of the clustering process.\n\nGiven the issue and the context provided, the focus should be on the fit and predict methods within the AffinityPropagation class. The fit method is responsible for performing the clustering and determining the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels. The predict method is responsible for labeling new data points based on the cluster centers found during fitting.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, we can see that the fit method sets up the parameters and calls the affinity_propagation function to perform the actual clustering. The predict method checks if the clustering resulted in any cluster centers and, if not, labels all samples as -1. This behavior aligns with the user's expectation regarding the handling of non-convergent cases.\n\nTherefore, the identified relevant code spans are those within the AffinityPropagation class, specifically the fit and predict methods.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
