However, the observed behavior is different. The user provided a code example illustrating this discrepancy and is looking for a reliable method to check if the clustering has converged without relying on the verbose option or checking if max_iter equals n_iter_. The provided search results contain the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class in the sklearn.cluster module, including its constructor, fit method, and predict method. These methods are crucial in determining how the clustering process is handled and how the results are returned. The relevant code spans include the fit method where the clustering logic is executed, and the predict method where the labels are assigned. It is essential to check these methods to ensure they handle the non-converged state as described in the documentation.
