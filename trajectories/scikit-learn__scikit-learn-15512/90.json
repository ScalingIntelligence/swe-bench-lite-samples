The user expects that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for labels for each sample. However, they observe different behavior where the algorithm still returns some cluster centers and labels, misleading the user into believing the clustering was successful. The user would prefer a property to check for convergence or to return -1 for labels when convergence does not occur. To address this, I need to identify any code that handles the non-convergence scenario and the properties involved in determining the state of convergence.\n\nI reviewed the current file context and the new search results, focusing on methods and functions that might address the non-convergence issue. The `AffinityPropagation` class in the file context has a `predict` method that returns -1 for labels if there are no cluster centers, indicating a non-converged state. The `fit` method also calls `affinity_propagation` which handles the core logic including the convergence check.\n\nIn the search results, the `affinity_propagation` function contains detailed logic for converging the algorithm, including checks for convergence and setting labels to -1 when convergence fails. This function is crucial as it aligns directly with the reported issue. The identified spans help in understanding how the algorithm behaves during and after non-convergence.\n\nThe identified spans in the `affinity_propagation` function are relevant as they show the handling of non-converged cases, including the assignment of labels and warning messages. This provides a comprehensive view of the convergence handling, which is crucial for understanding the issue.",
