The initial analysis suggests that the class has methods to handle the affinity matrix, fit the data, and predict clusters. Particularly relevant are the fit and predict methods, which manage the actual clustering process and labeling of data points. The fit method updates the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ attributes, which should ideally reflect non-convergence by returning empty arrays and assigning -1 labels. However, the actual behavior observed by the user differs from this expectation. Given this discrepancy, the relevant sections to investigate further are the fit and predict methods within the AffinityPropagation class to determine how non-convergence is detected and handled in the scikit-learn implementation. Additionally, it is worth examining if any warning or special handling is provided when the algorithm does not converge as expected. The predict method includes a warning about non-convergence and assigns -1 labels, which could be a point of interest to verify against the user's findings.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
