Specifically, the user expects the algorithm to return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for labels when it does not converge, but in practice, it does not always do so. The user is looking for a more reliable way to check if the algorithm has converged without relying on the verbose option or checking the number of iterations. \n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans include the `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class in `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py`. This method is responsible for performing the clustering and setting the `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` attributes. The user's concern is about how these attributes are set when the algorithm does not converge. \n\nAnalyzing the `fit` method, it appears that the implementation does not explicitly handle the case where the algorithm does not converge by setting `cluster_centers_indices_` to an empty array and `labels_` to -1. Instead, it seems to rely on the internal logic of the `affinity_propagation` function to handle this case, which might not be consistent with the documentation. This could be the source of the discrepancy described in the issue.\n\nThe `predict` method also contains logic that assumes `cluster_centers_` exists, which might not be the case if the algorithm does not converge. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the user's script.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans are those related to the `fit` and `predict` methods of the `AffinityPropagation` class, as they pertain directly to the functionality of the clustering algorithm and its behavior when converging or not converging.",

The user expects to receive an empty list for cluster centers and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, as stated in the documentation. However, the user is experiencing different results and is seeking a more reliable way to detect non-convergence without relying on the verbose option or checking if the number of iterations reached the maximum. \n\nIn the provided file context, we see the `AffinityPropagation` class definition, which includes the `fit` and `predict` methods. The `fit` method calls the `affinity_propagation` function to perform the clustering and handle the convergence logic. The `predict` method handles the prediction for new data points and includes a warning for non-convergence, labeling all samples as -1.\n\nIn the new search results, we find the `affinity_propagation` function, which contains the core logic for the Affinity Propagation algorithm. It includes the logic for handling convergence and non-convergence cases. The function sets the labels to -1 and the cluster centers to an empty list if the algorithm does not converge. This aligns with the user's expectations.\n\nBased on the search results, the relevant code spans to address the issue are found in the `affinity_propagation` function, specifically the handling of the non-convergence case. The identified code spans are:\n\n- 'affinity_propagation' for the overall function implementing the Affinity Propagation algorithm.\n- 'AffinityPropagation.fit' for the method that calls the `affinity_propagation` function and handles the results.\n\nThese code spans should be sufficient to understand and address the reported issue regarding the return values of non-converged affinity propagation clustering.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
