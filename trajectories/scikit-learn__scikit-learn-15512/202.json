According to the documentation, upon non-convergence, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the example provided shows different results, suggesting a discrepancy. The relevant code spans to address this issue would include the initialization of the AffinityPropagation class, the fit method where the clustering happens, and the predict method which handles the labeling post-clustering. These methods are essential to understand how the algorithm handles non-convergence and how it assigns labels. The fit method is particularly important as it contains the logic for determining cluster centers and labels based on the affinity matrix and other parameters. The predict method also checks for the presence of cluster centers before assigning labels, which is relevant for managing non-convergence scenarios.",

However, they observe different results. The current context shows relevant code spans related to the AffinityPropagation class and its methods that deal with fitting and predicting clustering results. The new search results include additional code spans related to the affinity_propagation function which is called within the fit method of the AffinityPropagation class. This function contains logic for clustering, including handling of convergence and non-convergence scenarios. The code spans from the new search results that are relevant to the reported issue are the blocks handling non-convergence within the affinity_propagation function, specifically where it sets labels to -1 and warns about the non-convergence. Additionally, the predict method in the AffinityPropagation class also handles the assignment of -1 labels when the model has no cluster centers. These code spans are relevant as they directly deal with the non-convergence scenario and the handling of labels and cluster centers according to the observed behavior and user expectations.",
