The user expects an empty array for cluster centers and -1 as labels for each sample, but sometimes gets different results (like [2] as cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as labels). The issue also mentions the preference for a property to check convergence instead of relying on verbose output or checking max_iter against n_iter_. The search results contain the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function. The function's behavior when the algorithm does not converge aligns with the documentation: it returns an empty array for cluster centers and -1 labels for each sample. However, the user's issue suggests that this isn't always happening, and there might be a bug or misunderstanding in the conditions under which the algorithm doesn't converge. The AffinityPropagation class uses this function and its fit method, which is where the user's clustering is performed. This context and the function's behavior match the user's concerns, especially around the handling of non-convergence. There's also a mention of a ConvergenceWarning, which could be relevant for the user's request to have a clear indication of non-convergence.",

However, the user's experience indicates that they are not getting these expected outputs, and instead, they are receiving different results. This discrepancy could be due to an issue in the implementation or a misunderstanding of the documentation.\n\nI will analyze the provided code spans to identify where the handling of non-convergence might be implemented incorrectly or where additional checks might be needed. The file_context provided includes several key methods such as AffinityPropagation.fit, AffinityPropagation.predict, and the function affinity_propagation. In these sections, there are checks for convergence and handling of non-convergence scenarios.\n\nThe search_results contain additional sections from sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py, where I find similar sections. Specifically, the affinity_propagation function handles non-convergence by setting labels to -1 and cluster centers to an empty list. I will focus on the areas where these actions are taken to ensure they are correctly implemented and not overridden elsewhere in the code. Additionally, potential issues related to the assignment of labels and cluster centers in non-convergence scenarios will be inspected.\n\nSince the search_results also include other clustering methods like KMeans and OPTICS, I will ensure that the analysis remains focused on Affinity Propagation, as these other methods are not directly related to the reported issue.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
