The user expects specific return values in such cases: an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, they observe different behavior in practice, which contradicts the documentation. The task is to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the convergence and return values of the algorithm. By analyzing the provided search results, it is clear that the class `AffinityPropagation` is responsible for the implementation of the algorithm. The `fit` method is particularly relevant as it handles the training of the model and computation of cluster centers and labels. Given the context of the issue, the relevant code spans would be the ones that initialize the algorithm parameters (`__init__`), train the model (`fit`), and predict labels (`predict`). These methods should be examined to determine if they correctly handle the non-convergence scenario and align with the documented behavior. The `predict` method already contains some handling for non-convergence, but it might not be sufficient based on the user's observations. Further analysis of these methods will provide insights into whether the implementation matches the expected behavior described in the documentation.",

The user expects specific return values when the clustering does not converge, as stated in the Documentation, but observes different behavior in their example. They seek a more direct way to determine if the clustering has converged without relying heavily on the 'verbose' option. Analyzing the provided code spans, the relevant sections include the initialization of the AffinityPropagation class, the fit method where the affinity matrix and cluster centers are determined, and the predict method where labels are assigned. The `predict` method includes handling for the case where no cluster centers are identified, suggesting that the algorithm did not converge. However, the user's issue relates to detecting non-convergence at a more fundamental level during the fit method itself. The `affinity_propagation` function definition is relevant as it contains the core logic for the Affinity Propagation algorithm, including parameters for convergence control. No additional code spans outside of these identified sections appear to be directly relevant to the issue of detecting non-convergence during the clustering process. It is suggested that the existing mechanisms, such as comparing `max_iter` with `n_iter_`, could be enhanced or supplemented to provide more explicit feedback on the convergence state of the Affinity Propagation algorithm.",
