The current file context provides an overview of the AffinityPropagation class and its methods. The 'fit' method is where the main clustering process happens.\n2. In the new search results, the 'affinity_propagation' function is where the actual clustering algorithm implementation resides. This function returns the cluster center indices and labels, as well as the number of iterations if requested.\n3. The 'affinity_propagation' function has a section that handles the scenario where the algorithm does not converge (indicated by the loop conditional: 'if (not unconverged and (K > 0)) or (it == max_iter):'). If the algorithm doesn't converge, it sets the labels to -1 and the cluster centers indices to an empty list. This behavior is expected based on the documentation.\n4. This code span appears to confirm and align with what the documentation states, providing context on how the algorithm handles non-convergence scenarios by setting labels to -1 and returning empty center indices.\nBased on the analysis, the search results are relevant, providing insight into how the algorithm implements the behavior described in the documentation for non-converging cases.",
