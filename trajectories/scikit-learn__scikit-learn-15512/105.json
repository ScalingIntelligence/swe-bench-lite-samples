            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, the key point is to determine the behavior of the AffinityPropagation algorithm when it does not converge. The user's expectation is to receive -1 values for labels when convergence does not occur. However, the provided example demonstrates a case where the algorithm returns [2] as the cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels when it is expected to return an empty list and [-1, -1, -1]. The user is seeking a way to programmatically determine whether the algorithm has converged without relying on the verbose option or checking iterations directly.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, the 'affinity_propagation' function and the 'AffinityPropagation' class in the sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py file are identified as highly relevant. The 'affinity_propagation' function directly handles the convergence logic and label assignments, specifically defining what happens if the algorithm does not converge. The 'AffinityPropagation' class integrates this function and provides the interface for fitting and predicting with the Affinity Propagation algorithm. The 'fit' method in the 'AffinityPropagation' class would be of particular interest as it encapsulates the logic for clustering. Additionally, the 'predict' method provides a way to predict labels and handles scenarios where there are no cluster centers.\n\nGiven this context, the relevant code spans are those that specifically handle the non-convergence scenario within the 'affinity_propagation' function and the methods that use the results of this function in the 'AffinityPropagation' class. These include the part where it assigns the labels as [-1]*n_samples when convergence does not occur, the _init_, _pairwise, fit, predict, and fit_predict methods in the 'AffinityPropagation' class.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
