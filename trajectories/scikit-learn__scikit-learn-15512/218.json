According to the documentation, the expected return values in case of non-convergence are an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the example provided shows different results, indicating a potential discrepancy between the documentation and the actual implementation. The search results provide the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class in the sklearn library. Specifically, the fit method is of interest as it handles the clustering process and sets the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ attributes. The current implementation does not explicitly handle the non-convergence scenario in a way that aligns with the documented behavior. It appears that additional logic may be required to check for convergence and appropriately set these attributes to indicate non-convergence.",
