However, the observed behavior in the provided example does not match these expectations. The user is seeking a reliable way to detect non-convergence without relying on verbose output or checking the iteration count against the maximum iteration limit.\n\nThe search results provide the relevant code spans within the `AffinityPropagation` class in the `sklearn.cluster._affinity_propagation` module. This class includes the `fit` method where the clustering process is initiated. The method calls the `affinity_propagation` function, which is crucial for understanding how non-convergence is handled. Specifically, the `fit` method assigns values to `self.cluster_centers_indices_`, `self.labels_`, and `self.n_iter_`, which are key to the user's issue. These spans are relevant as they directly pertain to the clustering process and the handling of non-convergence.\n\nAnalyzing these spans, it appears that the current implementation lacks explicit handling for the non-convergence scenario as described in the documentation. This discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual behavior in the code is what the user is encountering. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to investigate and potentially correct the issue regarding the return values for non-converged clustering.",

However, the user experiences different behavior where they receive incorrect cluster centers and labels instead. The relevant code spans in the provided search results are crucial for understanding the logic applied when determining convergence or not. The 'affinity_propagation' function is evaluated to see if it properly handles the non-convergence scenario. The function uses a convergence check based on 'convergence_iter' and 'max_iter' to decide whether to break the loop, indicating convergence, or if it runs the full 'max_iter' without converging, it should return an empty cluster center array and -1 labels. The sections where these checks and return values occur are significant for aligning with the documented behavior. By examining the function, I can conclude that it correctly returns empty cluster_center_indices and -1 labels if it doesn't converge. However, outside this function, in the 'AffinityPropagation.fit' method, the code does not explicitly handle or report back non-convergence status in a way that supports the observed behavior of returning incorrect labels when the algorithm does not converge.
