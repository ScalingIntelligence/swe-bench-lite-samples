However, the observed behavior is different, with non-empty cluster center indices and non-negative labels being returned. The solution suggested is to have a property that checks if the clustering has converged instead of relying on verbose output or checking if the number of iterations equals max_iter.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans, the most relevant sections are those that handle the fitting of the data and the prediction after fitting. The `fit` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class processes the input data, calculates the affinity matrix, and determines the cluster centers and labels. The `predict` method handles the prediction of labels for new data, including handling cases where no cluster centers are present due to non-convergence. These sections are directly related to the steps that would need to be modified to address the reported issue.\n\nTherefore, the identified code spans are the `fit` and `predict` methods of the `AffinityPropagation` class, as they include the logic pertinent to clustering and labeling, and would likely be where any modifications or additional checks for convergence would be implemented.",

From the provided context and search results, it's clear that the relevant files and code spans revolve around the `AffinityPropagation` class and the `affinity_propagation` function. The `AffinityPropagation.fit` method is particularly relevant as it handles the main logic of fitting the data and setting the cluster center indices and labels. The `affinity_propagation` function is responsible for the actual computation and checks for convergence. It updates the responsibilities (R) and availabilities (A) matrices and checks for convergence based on the number of iterations without change in the cluster assignments. If the algorithm does not converge, it sets labels to -1 and returns an empty list for cluster centers, which matches the documentation. However, the user's observation about the behavior does not align with this documented behavior, suggesting a potential discrepancy. Further investigation might be needed to determine if this is an issue with the implementation or the user's understanding.

It calls the 'affinity_propagation' function which manages the actual affinity propagation algorithm. If the affinity is not 'precomputed', it calculates the affinity matrix using negative squared Euclidean distances. The results of the 'affinity_propagation' function are assigned to 'self.cluster_centers_indices_', 'self.labels_', and 'self.n_iter_'. The 'predict' method checks if there are any cluster centers and, if not, it warns about non-convergence and labels every sample as '-1'. This suggests that the 'affinity_propagation' function itself might handle non-convergence, but the current implementation in the 'predict' method does not reflect what the documentation claims. We need to further investigate the 'affinity_propagation' function to understand its behavior when the algorithm does not converge.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
