According to the documentation, the expected behavior upon non-convergence is to return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the user experiences different results, which may indicate a potential discrepancy between the documentation and the actual implementation.\n\nTo identify relevant code spans that address this issue, I reviewed the provided code snippets from the AffinityPropagation class. The fit method is central to the issue as it performs the clustering and sets the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ attributes. The predict method also handles predictions and includes a safeguard for non-convergence by returning -1 labels if there are no cluster centers. This suggests that the functionality to handle non-convergence might be partially implemented, possibly implying that the problem lies in how the convergence is checked or reported during the fitting process.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans that seem connected to the reported issue are the fit and predict methods. The fit method initializes and runs the clustering algorithm, which determines the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. The predict method, on the other hand, handles post-clustering predictions and includes specific handling for the case where no cluster centers exist, likely due to non-convergence. These spans are crucial to understanding how the algorithm behaves when it fails to converge and align with the user's concern about detecting non-convergence accurately.",

According to the documentation, the expected behavior in such cases is to return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 as the label for each training sample. However, the example provided shows that the algorithm returns [2] as the cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as cluster labels, which contradicts the documentation. Given this context, the task is to identify the relevant code spans that handle the convergence and non-convergence scenarios in the Affinity Propagation algorithm in the scikit-learn codebase.\n\nThe file_context already provides significant insight into the AffinityPropagation class, particularly the fit method where the convergence is assessed and the cluster_centers_indices and labels are determined. The new search results present the affinity_propagation function, which is crucial as it contains the core logic for determining convergence and setting the cluster_centers_indices and labels. It is evident that this function includes the logic for handling non-convergence by setting labels to [-1] and cluster_centers_indices to an empty array. This directly addresses the issue reported, suggesting that the code is, in fact, implemented to handle non-convergence as described in the documentation, although something in the execution seems to deviate from this expectation. Given the provided code spans, they are all relevant to the issue, particularly those in the affinity_propagation function which is the core of the Affinity Propagation algorithm's operation.\n\nBased on this analysis, all identified code spans in both the file_context and the new search results are relevant to the reported issue.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
