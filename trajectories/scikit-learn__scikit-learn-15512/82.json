Specifically, the user expects that when the algorithm does not converge, the returned cluster centers and labels would reflect this non-convergence, which is not happening based on the user's example. The search results provide a detailed look into the AffinityPropagation class from the scikit-learn library, which includes the initialization parameters, the fit method where clustering is executed, and the predict method. Based on the reported issue and the search results, the most relevant code spans are those within the fit method, where the actual clustering process takes place. Additionally, the predict method might also be relevant if it involves handling non-converged clustering outcomes, although it appears to address non-convergence primarily through a warning and labeling samples as '-1' when there are no cluster centers. Since there's a discrepancy in non-convergence behavior, it's crucial to focus on the parts of the code that handle or represent the results of non-convergence.",

The key elements to focus on are how the algorithm handles non-convergence and how it updates the cluster_centers_indices and labels attributes in such scenarios. The provided search results include the definition of the affinity_propagation function, which is crucial for understanding the algorithm's behavior during convergence or non-convergence. It is observed in the affinity_propagation function that when the algorithm does not converge (K == 0), it sets the labels to -1 and cluster_centers_indices to an empty list, which aligns with the documentation's description. However, the user's example suggests that they are not receiving these expected results. Therefore, the relevance of the provided code spans is evaluated based on whether they affect the output in case of non-convergence. Given the evidence, the identified code spans do not directly contradict the documentation, but they highlight the need to ensure that the conditions set within the affinity_propagation function are properly executed in real-world scenarios.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
