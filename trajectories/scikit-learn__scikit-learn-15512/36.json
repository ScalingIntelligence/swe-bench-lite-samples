The expected behavior based on the documentation is that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the example provided shows different outputs, which suggests a potential bug or an issue with the documentation.\n\nAnalyzing the code spans from the search results, the relevant sections are in the AffinityPropagation class within the 'sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py' file. Specifically, the __init__ method sets up the parameters for the AffinityPropagation instance, and the fit method is where the actual clustering happens. The fit method calls the affinity_propagation function, which handles the iteration process and determines the cluster centers and labels. However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where the algorithm does not converge to adjust the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels accordingly to match the documented behavior of returning empty lists and -1 values.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that the search results do identify relevant code spans. The code spans related to the AffinityPropagation class and its methods are the ones where modifications would need to be made to address the issue with non-converging cases. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue, and further work would be needed to adjust the behavior for non-convergence scenarios.",

According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices and a label of -1 for each training sample. However, in the provided example, the clustering does not converge but returns [2] as the cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as cluster labels instead of the expected empty list and [-1, -1, -1] respectively. This discrepancy suggests a potential bug or an inconsistency between the documentation and the actual implementation.\n\nThe identified code spans from the `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py` file include both the `AffinityPropagation` class and the `affinity_propagation` function. The `AffinityPropagation` class includes the `fit` method where the clustering process is initiated, and this method calls the `affinity_propagation` function. The `affinity_propagation` function is responsible for executing the Affinity Propagation algorithm, including the checks for convergence and the assignment of cluster labels.\n\nBased on the issue, it is crucial to investigate the handling of the non-convergence scenario in the `affinity_propagation` function, specifically where labels and cluster center indices are determined. The code provided contains the logic where labels are set to `-1` for each sample if no clusters are found (K == 0). This matches the documented behavior. However, the error in the provided example indicates that this condition might not be correctly applied, possibly due to a mistake in the underlying logic or a misinterpretation of the algorithm's state.\n\nFor developers looking to address this issue, they should focus on the `affinity_propagation` function, ensuring that the labels are correctly set to `-1` when no clusters are identified and that the function adheres to the documented behavior. Reviewing the logic just before the assignment of `labels` and `cluster_centers_indices` when K == 0 could be particularly relevant in identifying the source of the discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, the `AffinityPropagation` class needs to be examined to ensure that it appropriately handles and propagates the results of the `affinity_propagation` function, maintaining the documented pattern of behavior in scenarios where the algorithm does not converge.",
