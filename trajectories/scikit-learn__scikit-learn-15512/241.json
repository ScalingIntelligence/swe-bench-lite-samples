This discrepancy needs to be addressed.\n\nThe search results provide the relevant class `AffinityPropagation` and its methods. The `fit` method is particularly important as it processes the data and assigns cluster centers and labels. The method calls `affinity_propagation`, which handles the actual clustering logic and returns `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`.\n\nThe `predict` method also checks if the model has any cluster centers to predict from, indicating that it considers an empty set of cluster centers a sign of non-convergence. The issue suggests that the code could benefit from an explicit check or property indicating whether the algorithm has converged, which could be integrated within the `fit` method or as a separate property.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified within the `AffinityPropagation` class, specifically the `fit` and `predict` methods.",
