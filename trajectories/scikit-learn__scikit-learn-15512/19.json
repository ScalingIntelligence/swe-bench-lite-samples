The documentation suggests that in case of non-convergence, the cluster_center_indices_ should be an empty array and labels_ should be -1 for each sample. However, the provided example shows different behavior. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. From the search results, we can see the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class which includes methods related to fitting the model and making predictions. The fit method sets up the clustering process and assigns the values to cluster_centers_indices_, labels_, and n_iter_. The predict method handles the prediction based on the computed cluster centers. A deeper inspection of the fit method is necessary to understand how it handles non-convergence. Also, the predict method includes a warning for non-convergence, but lacks a direct check for convergence status in the returned values from the fit method. These pieces of code are directly relevant to understanding and addressing the issue reported.",

The parts of the code relevant to the issue at hand include the handling of the affinity matrix, the logic for determining cluster centers, and the return values in the case of non-convergence. Specifically, the predict method contains logic to return -1 labels if no cluster centers are found, aligning with the expected behavior when convergence fails.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
