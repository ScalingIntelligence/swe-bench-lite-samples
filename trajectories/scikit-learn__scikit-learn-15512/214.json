The documentation suggests that an empty array should be returned for cluster_center_indices and -1 for labels in case of non-convergence. However, the provided example shows that it returns [2] and [0,0,0] instead. To address this, it's important to investigate the AffinityPropagation class and its methods, especially `fit`, which handles the main clustering logic. Additionally, the documentation in the `_affinity_propagation.py` file should be checked for any discrepancies. We should also look into the ConvergenceWarning to ensure it is being raised appropriately when the algorithm does not converge. Lastly, we should check if there's an existing property or method that could indicate non-convergence, or if improvements are needed to deduce non-convergence programmatically without relying solely on the verbose option.",

The user expects specific outputs in case of non-convergence, as stated in the documentation, but observes different results in practice. The key relevant code spans are found within the `AffinityPropagation` class in `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py`, specifically in the `__init__` and `fit` methods. These methods define the parameters for the AffinityPropagation algorithm and the logic that handles the fitting process, including the management of the affinity matrix, the iteration process, and the results of the clustering. The `fit` method is particularly important as it contains the logic for checking and processing the affinity matrix, determining the cluster centers and labels, and handling the iterations. The issue suggests that there might be a discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual implementation in the `fit` method regarding how non-convergence is handled.

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
