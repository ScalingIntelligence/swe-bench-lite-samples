However, the example provided shows different results when the clustering does not converge, raising questions about whether the documented behavior is accurate and how to detect non-convergence effectively.\n\nIn examining the search results, the code spans for the AffinityPropagation class and its fit method are particularly relevant. These code spans reveal the internal workings of the clustering process and how the results are determined. Specifically, the fit method includes the logic for executing the affinity propagation and capturing results. The documentation assertion about returning an empty array and -1 labels upon non-convergence needs to be verified against the actual implementation logic found in these code spans. Additionally, the code allows for optional parameters like `verbose` and `max_iter` that could indirectly hint at convergence issues, but direct checks for convergence status are not explicitly coded in the provided spans.\n\nTo address the issue, it would be beneficial to check how the method handles cases where convergence does not occur and whether it aligns with the documented behavior. The current spans do not show an explicit check for non-convergence or the management of results in such scenarios. Further analysis or code spans showing the affinity_propagation function's implementation and its handling of non-convergence could help confirm or disprove the reported issue.",

The issue also suggests two potential solutions: to either return -1 values in labels_ or to provide a property that indicates whether the clustering has converged. The search results provide insights into the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function. The code in the search results does not explicitly handle the non-convergence scenario by setting all labels_ to -1 or providing a clear indication of convergence failure beyond the verbose option. The function `affinity_propagation` does issue a ConvergenceWarning but does not update the labels_ with -1 values as the documentation suggests it should.

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
