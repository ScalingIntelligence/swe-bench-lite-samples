The user expects that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for each label. However, the user's experience suggests that this is not always the case. The code analysis focuses on the AffinityPropagation class within the sklearn.cluster._affinity_propagation module. The relevant parts include the fit method, which calculates the cluster centers and labels, and the predict method, which handles the prediction for new data. Specifically, the predict method includes a condition to handle the situation where the algorithm has not converged, by returning -1 for each sample. This suggests that the issue might be with the fit method not correctly reflecting non-convergence through the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ attributes.

The user is not getting the expected output (-1 labels and empty cluster centers) when the algorithm does not converge, but instead receives cluster labels and centers as if the algorithm had converged. This discrepancy is problematic because it might lead users to incorrectly assume that clustering has successfully occurred. \n\nExamining the provided code spans, we see that the AffinityPropagation class in the sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py file has methods for initialization, fitting, and prediction. The fit method calls the affinity_propagation function, which handles the actual clustering logic. The affinity_propagation function includes detailed checks for convergence and sets labels to -1 if there are no clusters found. However, the current implementation in the fit method does not explicitly check for convergence status except through verbose output or by comparing max_iter and n_iter_. \n\nThe search results include the full implementation of the affinity_propagation function, which holds the logic for checking cluster convergence and correctly assigning -1 labels when no clusters are found. This implementation is crucial for addressing the issue as it demonstrates how to properly handle non-convergence scenarios by setting appropriate labels and issues warnings. \n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue as they pertain to the core logic of the AffinityPropagation algorithm, its convergence checking, and label assignment.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
