The search results provide valuable insights into the `AffinityPropagation` class and its methods, particularly the `__init__` and `fit` methods. The `fit` method is crucial as it initializes and executes the clustering process. It can be seen that the `fit` method calls `affinity_propagation` with parameters like `max_iter`, `convergence_iter`, `damping`, etc., and it assigns values to `self.cluster_centers_indices_` and `self.labels_`. The code spans provided do not directly address the issue of non-convergence behavior, such as when the clustering does not converge, and how it should handle returning -1 labels or an indication of convergence.

The user is seeking a way to determine if the algorithm has converged without relying on the verbose option or checking max_iter against n_iter_. From the provided code, the key function to investigate is affinity_propagation, which is responsible for the actual clustering process. The main points to analyze are how the function handles non-convergence and whether it correctly follows the documented behavior. The code for affinity_propagation includes conditions that set labels to -1 and cluster_centers_indices to an empty list if the algorithm does not converge within the specified number of iterations. This matches the documented behavior, but the discrepancy suggests there might be a case where this condition is not properly triggered or there is misleading information in the documentation.
