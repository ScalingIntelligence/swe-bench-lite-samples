To address this, we need to investigate the code in the AffinityPropagation class and its methods, particularly focusing on the fit method, which is where the clustering is performed.

The task is to find the relevant code spans in the provided search results that address this issue.\n\nUpon examining the search results, the class AffinityPropagation is of particular interest. Within this class, the fit, predict, and __init__ methods are relevant. The fit method processes the input data and determines the cluster centers and labels. The method checks if the affinity is 'precomputed' or 'euclidean' and calculates the affinity matrix accordingly. It then passes this matrix to the affinity_propagation function. The predict method is also significant as it handles the prediction of labels based on the cluster centers. The __init__ method initializes the parameters including max_iter, which is relevant to the non-convergence issue. The code spans related to these methods should be identified as relevant to the reported issue.\n\nThe identified spans are from the __init__, fit, and predict methods.
