The user expects certain return values when the algorithm does not converge, but the observed behavior differs. To address this, I will focus on the `AffinityPropagation` class and its methods, particularly `fit` and `predict`, to identify where the algorithm's failure to converge is handled. This will help determine if the current implementation aligns with the documentation's description of the expected behavior or if there are discrepancies that need to be addressed.\n\nThe provided code spans show the implementation of the `AffinityPropagation` class, including its constructor, properties, and methods. The `fit` method is particularly relevant as it performs the clustering and captures the results in `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`. The `predict` method is also important as it handles the case where there are no cluster centers due to non-convergence.\n\nExamining these methods, especially where the convergence status is checked and the results are set, will help pinpoint the logic that controls the return values in the case of non-convergence. Based on the analysis in the next step, I will make a decision on the relevance and completion of the task.",
