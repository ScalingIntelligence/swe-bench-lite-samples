The user expects specific return values in such cases but observes different results. The relevant code spans in the search results are primarily centered around the initialization and the fit method of the AffinityPropagation class. These spans include the constructor where parameters like max_iter and verbose are set, and the fit method where the clustering logic is executed. However, the code currently does not handle the non-convergence scenario as expected by the user, which involves returning empty arrays and -1 labels. This is evident from the provided example and the user's description of the current behavior. It is crucial to identify not just the instantiation and fitting of the model but also to review how the convergence status is handled within the fit method to propose any adjustments needed. This review is essential because the user's core issue revolves around the clarity and accuracy of convergence indication, which are crucial for their use case within a larger script.",
