However, the user experiences different outputs, which suggests a possible discrepancy with the documentation or implementation.\n\nThe search results provide a detailed look at the AffinityPropagation class implementation in the sklearn.cluster package. The class initialization and fit method are particularly relevant for understanding how the algorithm processes data and handles convergence. Notably, the fit method contains the core logic for determining the cluster centers and labels, which aligns with the user's concern about the expected outputs for non-converged clustering.\n\nGiven the issue's focus on convergence handling, the identified code spans include all sections that initialize and modify the class attributes, particularly those related to cluster centers and labels, during the fit method implementation.

The new search results provide the implementation of the affinity_propagation function, which is called by the fit method. This function handles the actual clustering process and checks for convergence.\n\nUpon analyzing the affinity_propagation function, I can see that the function does indeed handle the convergence scenario and updates the labels and cluster_centers_indices accordingly.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
