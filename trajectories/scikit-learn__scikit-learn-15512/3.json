However, in the provided example, the clustering process does not converge yet returns non-empty cluster centers and labels. The user is seeking a more reliable way to detect non-convergence without relying solely on the verbose option or checking the iteration count. The search results provided include the AffinityPropagation class definition with its __init__ method and the fit method. The fit method appears to be the crucial part as it contains the logic for performing the affinity propagation clustering and assigning cluster centers and labels. This method should be examined closely to understand how non-convergence is currently handled and whether it aligns with the documented behavior. The identified code span from the fit method is relevant as it directly relates to the processing of the clustering and the assignment of cluster centers and labels. This span should be further analyzed to see if any adjustments are needed to ensure conformity with the documented non-convergence behavior.",
