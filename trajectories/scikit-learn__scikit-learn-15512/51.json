The user expects the algorithm to return empty cluster center indices and labels of -1 for each sample when convergence fails, as stated in the documentation. However, in the provided example, different results are observed, and there seems to be a discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual implementation. To address this, it's necessary to identify the parts of the code responsible for handling non-convergence scenarios and to ensure these parts align with the documented functionality.\n\nGiven the <file_context> and <search_results>, the relevant code spans are found within the `AffinityPropagation` class and the `affinity_propagation` function. The `fit` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class calls the `affinity_propagation` function, which is central to the computation of cluster centers and labels. Within the `affinity_propagation` function, the handling of convergence and non-convergence scenarios is critical.\n\nFrom the provided code, it's evident that if convergence is not achieved within the maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`), the code handles this by setting labels to -1 and cluster centers to an empty list. This behavior aligns with the documented expectation. The code also issues a `ConvergenceWarning` to alert about the non-convergence. The initial report indicated confusion about observed outputs ([2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels) when non-convergence was expected. This suggests that either the initial data setup or the actual execution might have caused the algorithm to falsely indicate convergence.\n\nThe identified code spans adequately address the handling of non-convergence and align with the documented behavior, thus providing a correct implementation of the expected functionality. The function `affinity_propagation` contains the logic for returning the correct labels and cluster centers accordingly based on whether the algorithm converged. The `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class integrates this functionality into the broader clustering process.",
