The user expects that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for each label. However, in the user's example, this is not the case, and they seek a reliable method to detect non-convergence without relying solely on the verbose output. The search results include the AffinityPropagation class definition from sklearn's cluster module, revealing the implementation of the fit method where the clustering logic is executed. This method sets up the affinity matrix based on the specified affinity type, then runs the affinity_propagation function. The results are stored in self.cluster_centers_indices_, self.labels_, and self.n_iter_. Based on the issue's context and the provided code, it seems the fit method could potentially handle the non-convergence situation differently. Therefore, this method and its handling of the affinity_propagation function call are likely relevant to the issue, even though the exact behavior described (returning empty array and -1 labels) is not explicitly implemented.",

The current implementation does not consistently meet this expectation. I analyzed the context provided in the file_context and the search_results to identify the relevant code spans. The main function where the clustering logic resides is in the `affinity_propagation` function within the `_affinity_propagation.py` file. This function defines how the cluster centers and labels are determined and returned. The key parts of the code where the behavior differs are where the algorithm checks for convergence and assigns cluster centers and labels. Based on the analysis, it seems the current behavior might need adjustments to align with the documented expectations. The relevant spans of code are those that initialize and update the cluster centers (indices) and labels, and the logic that determines whether the algorithm has converged. The identified spans are: 1. Initialization and update of the cluster centers and labels. 2. The condition checks and logical operations that determine convergence.
