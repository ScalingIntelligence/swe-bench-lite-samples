However, in the example provided, different results are observed. The next step is to examine the relevant code spans in the search results to understand how the AffinityPropagation class is implemented and how it handles convergence. The 'fit' method in the AffinityPropagation class is particularly relevant, as it contains the logic for performing the clustering and determining cluster centers and labels. This method calls 'affinity_propagation', which is responsible for the actual clustering process. Based on the issue, it is clear that the method does not follow the documented behavior when a lack of convergence occurs, which is a critical point for further exploration and potential correction. The provided exceptions file might not be directly relevant to the current issue but could be valuable for identifying or raising specific warnings related to convergence.

The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label in labels_. However, the user's experience shows different results, leading to confusion and the need for a more reliable way to detect non-convergence. From the provided search results, the analysis focuses on the relevant code spans in the sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py file, specifically the blocks related to the AffinityPropagation class, its fit method, and the underlying affinity_propagation function. These code spans provide insights into how the algorithm handles non-convergence and how it sets the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. By examining these sections, we can determine if the current behavior aligns with the documentation and identify potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the search results also include the sklearn/exceptions.py file, especially the ConvergenceWarning, which is likely used to handle non-convergence scenarios but might not be sufficient based on the user's experience.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
