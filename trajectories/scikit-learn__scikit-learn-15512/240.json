To investigate this, we should focus on the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and its associated methods to understand how non-convergence is handled and why the returned values differ from the documented behavior.",

Crucial sections include the __init__ method for defining the parameters, the fit method where the clustering is performed, and the predict method for labeling new data points. Notably, the fit method calls an underlying affinity_propagation function. The predict method includes a check for the presence of cluster centers and returns -1 if none are found, as a response to non-convergence.\n\nGiven the issue, the relevant code spans are:\n1. The __init__ method where parameters like max_iter are defined.\n2. The fit method where the clustering is carried out and results are assigned.\n3. The predict method where the behavior related to non-convergence is handled.\n\nThese sections are crucial for understanding how the algorithm behaves during and after clustering, especially in cases of non-convergence.

The documentation states that upon non-convergence, an empty array should be returned for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label. However, the user observes different behavior in their example. They seek a more robust way to check for convergence without relying solely on the verbose option or manually comparing max_iter and n_iter_. \n\nReviewing the provided code spans, the class AffinityPropagation and the function affinity_propagation are central to the issue. The fit method in the AffinityPropagation class calls the affinity_propagation function, which handles the clustering logic. In the non-convergence scenario, the affinity_propagation function sets the labels to -1 and the cluster_centers_indices to an empty list. \n\nThe user's concern is valid, as there appears to be a mismatch between the documentation and the observed behavior. The relevant code spans show that the expected behavior for non-convergence is correctly implemented in the affinity_propagation function. Therefore, the issue might be related to how the results are handled or interpreted in the user's example script. Further investigation into how the user's script processes these results would be beneficial. \n\nGiven the provided code spans, the identified relevant sections are the initialization, fit, and predict methods of the AffinityPropagation class, as well as the affinity_propagation function itself. These sections directly relate to the execution of the clustering algorithm and handling of its results, including the non-convergence case. Thus, these code spans should be sufficient for addressing the user's issue concerning non-converged clustering returns.",

This behavior matches the documentation's description. The fit method itself captures these results in the self.cluster_centers_indices_, self.labels_, and self.n_iter_ attributes.
