According to the documentation, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label when it does not converge. However, the provided example demonstrates different behavior, suggesting a possible discrepancy or bug in the implementation. To address this, we need to locate the relevant part of the code where the convergence status is checked and the return values are set. This could include examining the AffinityPropagation class methods and the underlying affinity propagation algorithm function. We should also check the documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the intended behavior.",

The user expects certain return values when the algorithm does not converge, as stated in the documentation, but experiences different behavior in practice. The search results include the complete `AffinityPropagation` class from the `sklearn.cluster` module, revealing the implementation of the `fit` method and the `predict` method. The `fit` method initializes the clustering process and the `predict` method handles prediction based on the computed cluster centers. The `fit` method directly invokes the `affinity_propagation` function to compute the cluster centers and labels. By examining these methods, it appears that the user's expectations might not align with the actual implementation in `fit` and `predict`. The class does not explicitly check for convergence status beyond the internal `affinity_propagation` function call. This discrepancy suggests that the actual behavior might not be as described in the documentation regarding non-convergence returns. To address the user's concern, one could consider whether adding a convergence check before returning the labels in the `predict` method or enhancing the `fit` method to store a convergence status might be a potential solution.",

The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and a label of -1 for each training sample. However, the user encounters a different behavior where cluster_centers_indices_ contains [2] and labels_ contains [0,0,0]. The user is seeking a way to determine if the clustering has failed without relying on the verbose option. Scanning through the code spans provided in the file context and search results, we observe that the AffinityPropagation class and its methods are central to this discussion. Specifically, the fit method is where the clustering process is executed. The affinity_propagation function within the fit method is responsible for the actual clustering, and it handles the non-convergence scenario by returning an empty list for cluster_centers_indices_ and labels with -1 for each sample. The predict method also addresses the non-convergence case by labeling every sample as '-1'. Thus, the relevant code spans are the ones that deal with the fit and predict methods of the AffinityPropagation class, as well as the affinity_propagation function responsible for the clustering logic. These code spans include checks and behaviors related to non-convergence, which are directly related to the issues raised by the user.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
