The search results provide the relevant code spans from the 'sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py' file where the AffinityPropagation class and its methods are defined. It includes the initialization (__init__), the fit method, and the predict method of the AffinityPropagation class. The fit method is where the actual affinity propagation is executed and where the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ are determined, making it the most relevant part for addressing the issue of handling non-convergence. Additionally, the predict method might need to consider non-convergence scenarios if not already handled.

The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array as cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 as labels for each training sample. However, the user's example indicates that this is not the observed behavior, leading to confusion. The user suggests an improvement by introducing a property to check if the clustering has converged or returning -1 values. The provided context and search results include the relevant code spans where the AffinityPropagation class is defined and implemented, notably the __init__, _pairwise, fit, and predict methods. These sections define how the AffinityPropagation instance is initialized, how the affinity matrix is processed, how the model is fitted to the data, and how predictions are made. The predict method includes a warning for cases where the model does not have any cluster centers, likely due to non-convergence, and assigns -1 to all samples. The code sections and comments within these methods align well with the issue reported, offering clear insight into the current handling of non-convergence scenarios. However, they do not directly address the user's query about whether the documentation is incorrect or how one might implement checks for convergence more conveniently. Therefore, while the provided code spans touch on relevant functionalities (initialization, fitting, and prediction), they do not fully resolve the user's query. Further investigation or modifications to the code may be needed to address the convergence checks more explicitly.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
