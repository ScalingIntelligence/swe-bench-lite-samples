The user expects an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, as stated in the documentation. However, they observe different behavior in their example. The user suggests adding a property to check if the algorithm has converged for better handling in a larger script. The relevant code spans are identified by focusing on the `AffinityPropagation` class and its methods, particularly `fit` and `predict`, where the logic for convergence and label assignments likely resides. Other classes and methods are not relevant to this specific issue.\n\n1. Analysis of the reported issue reveals the need to check the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class, specifically focusing on how convergence is handled and how labels are assigned.\n2. Reviewing the `AffinityPropagation.fit` method, it calls the `affinity_propagation` function and assigns `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_` and `n_iter_`. This method is crucial for understanding convergence.\n3. The `AffinityPropagation.predict` method is also important as it generates predictions and handles cases where no cluster centers are found, likely due to non-convergence.\n4. Other classes and methods, such as `RANSACRegressor`, `KMeans`, `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis`, etc., are not directly relevant to the issue of Affinity Propagation non-convergence.\n\nAfter analyzing the relevant code spans, it is clear that the AffinityPropagation class and its methods `fit` and `predict` are the key areas to investigate for addressing the reported issue. Other sections of the codebase, while valuable for other functionalities, are not pertinent to this specific problem.",
