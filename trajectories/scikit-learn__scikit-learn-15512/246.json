The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and `-1` for each training sample in `labels_`. However, the user reports that instead of receiving these expected values, they receive inconsistent results. This discrepancy needs to be investigated in the code. The provided code spans contain the implementation of the Affinity Propagation algorithm, including the function `affinity_propagation` and the class `AffinityPropagation`. The code shows how the algorithm handles convergence and what it returns in different scenarios. Specifically, the code checks for convergence using the number of iterations and sets the labels to `-1` or calculates the cluster centers based on the results of the algorithm. This directly relates to the issue reported as it discusses the handling of non-convergence and the values returned. Thus, these code spans are highly relevant to resolving the issue.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
