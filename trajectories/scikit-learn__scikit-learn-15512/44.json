The user expects to get an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, but the current implementation does not seem to handle this case correctly. The search results provide the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and its methods. The fit method is of particular interest as it handles the clustering process and sets the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. There is no explicit check for convergence within the fit method, which might explain the unexpected behavior. Additionally, the predict method handles the case where there are no cluster centers by labeling every sample as '-1', which indicates a potential place to implement a more robust check for convergence. The current implementation lacks a direct way to determine if the clustering has converged without using the verbose option or checking the number of iterations. This needs to be addressed to properly handle non-convergent cases.",
