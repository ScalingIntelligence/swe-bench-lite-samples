The user expects to receive an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, as per the documentation. However, in the provided example, when the algorithm does not converge, it returns [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. The user is seeking a way to determine if the clustering has failed without relying on the verbose option or checking if max_iter == n_iter_.\n\nReviewing the 'AffinityPropagation' class code in the search results, we can observe the implementation of the 'fit' and 'predict' methods. In the 'fit' method, the affinity propagation is called, and it returns cluster_centers_indices_, labels_, and n_iter_. In the 'predict' method, if there are no cluster centers (indicating non-convergence), a warning is issued, and an array of -1 is returned for the labels. This behavior seems to align with the user's expectation of handling non-convergence cases.\n\nTo address the user's concern, it appears that the 'predict' method already handles the non-convergence scenario by returning -1 for labels if the algorithm did not converge. However, the user might not be aware of the state of convergence during the 'fit' method without explicitly checking the labels or using verbose. To make this process more transparent and align with the user's desire for better handling of non-convergence scenarios, checking and handling of non-convergence could be improved within the 'fit' method to set a property indicating convergence status, which can then be checked easily by the user.",

The documentation states that in the event of non-convergence, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 labels for each sample. However, the user's experience shows that this is not consistently happening. They also suggest a more robust way to check for convergence apart from using the verbose option.\n\nReviewing the current file context and new search results, I found several relevant code spans. The `AffinityPropagation` class's `fit` method is crucial, as it handles the core logic of the Affinity Propagation algorithm. The `affinity_propagation` function, which is called within `fit`, also contains significant logic regarding the convergence criteria and what to return in case of non-convergence. Specifically, the code checks for convergence and sets the labels and cluster_centers_indices accordingly. There is a condition handling non-convergence, which sets labels to [-1] and returns an empty list for cluster_centers_indices, but this logic might not always be triggered as expected.\n\nFor the user's concern about detecting non-convergence without relying on the verbose option, we need to ensure that the convergence check is robust and that the returned values correctly reflect the algorithm's state. The `predict` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class also deals with handling predictions when no clusters are formed, which could be another area to review for consistency with reported behavior.\n\nGiven these insights, the identified spans from both the file context and new search results are relevant for addressing the issue. They cover the initialization, fitting, and prediction processes of the Affinity Propagation algorithm, including how the algorithm handles convergence and what it returns in cases of non-convergence.",
