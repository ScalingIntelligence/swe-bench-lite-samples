The user expects certain outputs when the algorithm does not converge, as described in the documentation, but is observing different behavior in practice. To address this, it's necessary to examine the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and its fit method in the sklearn codebase. Based on the provided search results, the code spans for AffinityPropagation.__init__ and AffinityPropagation.fit are highly relevant. These spans reveal the parameters and logic used during the fitting process, which could be where the divergence from expected behavior occurs. Specifically, the fit method is responsible for running the affinity propagation algorithm and setting the attributes like cluster_centers_indices_, labels_, and n_iter_. It's essential to ensure that these attributes are correctly set based on whether the algorithm converges or not. The code suggests that the current implementation might not be properly reflecting non-convergence status, which aligns with the user's issue. Thus, identifying these spans is crucial for understanding the problem and potentially fixing it.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
