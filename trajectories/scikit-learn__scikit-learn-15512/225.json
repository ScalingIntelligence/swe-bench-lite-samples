The documentation suggests that an empty array should be returned for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label when convergence does not occur. However, in the provided example, [2] is returned as the cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as cluster labels, which deviates from the expected behavior described in the documentation. This raises questions about the handling of non-convergence and the correctness of the documentation.\n\nRegarding the code context, the `AffinityPropagation` class in `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py` contains the `fit` method, which calls `affinity_propagation` with parameters including `max_iter` and `convergence_iter`. These are critical for understanding the convergence behavior but do not directly address the return values on non-convergence.\n\nIn reviewing the new search results, the `affinity_propagation` function handles the logic for the Affinity Propagation algorithm. It includes checks for mutual equality among samples, running the algorithm in cases where all samples have equal similarities, and the loop that executes the iterations for convergence. The return values include `cluster_centers_indices` and `labels`, which are influenced by the behavior of the loop and specific conditions for convergence. Specifically, the function returns labels with -1 values if no convergence occurs. This appears to be in line with the documentation but might need further validation to ensure actual implementation matches expected behavior.\n\nGiven the analysis, the identified spans appear relevant to the reported issue, as they cover the core logic handling the Affinity Propagation algorithm's behavior on convergence, including the return values for non-convergence.",
