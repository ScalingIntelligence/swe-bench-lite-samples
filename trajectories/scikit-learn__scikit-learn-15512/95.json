According to the documentation, it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each sample in labels when the algorithm does not converge. However, the example provided shows different behavior. To address this, it's important to investigate the source code of the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function to understand how non-convergence is handled and ensure the documentation matches the actual behavior.",

The relevant spans of code to look at are those that handle the convergence, return values, and the fit method of AffinityPropagation. The fit method should be of particular interest as it orchestrates the computation of clustering results based on the affinity matrix and other parameters, where it should ideally detect non-convergence and handle it by assigning -1 to labels. Here, the span ids 'AffinityPropagation', 'AffinityPropagation.__init__', 'AffinityPropagation.fit', and 'AffinityPropagation.predict' are the most relevant as they contain the initialization, fitting, and prediction methods which might handle or propagate non-convergence cases.
