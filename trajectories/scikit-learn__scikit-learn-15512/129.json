The provided search results contain the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function, which are central to addressing the issue. The affinity_propagation function computes the clustering and handles the conditions for convergence and non-convergence, which is key to understanding and potentially resolving the issue. The class AffinityPropagation is responsible for fitting and predicting the clusters, utilizing the affinity_propagation function. Examining these parts of the code will provide insights into how convergence is managed and how the results are returned when the algorithm does not converge, which is crucial for addressing the user's concern.",

The code spans identified as relevant are:\n\n1. `affinity_propagation` function: This function contains the main logic for the affinity propagation algorithm, including the convergence check.\n2. `AffinityPropagation` class: This class integrates the `affinity_propagation` function into the sklearn estimator interface.\n3. `AffinityPropagation.fit` method: This method calls the `affinity_propagation` function and handles the results.\n\nThe code spans `affinity_propagation`, `AffinityPropagation`, and `AffinityPropagation.fit` are relevant because they directly involve the logic for checking convergence and handling the results, which are central to the reported issue.\n\nThe other files and spans in the search results, such as those related to other clustering algorithms (SpectralClustering, AgglomerativeClustering) or unrelated functionality (Silhouette scores, OPTICS), are not relevant to the specific issue of non-converged affinity propagation return values.",
