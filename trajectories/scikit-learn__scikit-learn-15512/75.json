The search results include the relevant code spans for the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function, which are key to understanding how the algorithm handles non-convergence. Notably, the code in the affinity_propagation function checks for convergence and sets labels to -1 when the algorithm fails to converge as expected. The user's concern about detecting non-convergence without relying on verbose output or checking iterations is also relevant for a broader solution. The provided code spans fully cover the handling of convergence and non-convergence in the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function, providing a clear understanding of the current behavior and potential areas for improvement or documentation clarification.",

A convergence status indirectly can be determined by comparing `self.max_iter_` and `self.n_iter_` because, under normal circumstances, if the algorithm converged before reaching `self.max_iter_`, less iterations would have taken place.
