The user expects an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for labels in case of non-convergence, as stated in the documentation. However, the user observes different behavior and seeks clarification or a way to detect non-convergence without relying on verbose output. The current code snippet in the search results shows the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function. Specifically, the affinity_propagation function handles the case of non-convergence by setting labels to -1 and cluster centers to an empty array. This matches the documented behavior. The identified code spans are relevant as they directly address the computation of cluster centers and labels during and after the Affinity Propagation process, including handling the case of non-convergence.",
