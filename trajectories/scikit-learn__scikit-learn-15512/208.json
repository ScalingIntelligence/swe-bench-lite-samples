The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the user has encountered a situation where it returns [2] as the cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as labels, which suggests a discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual implementation.\n\nTo address this issue, it is necessary to find the relevant code spans that handle the convergence check and the setting of the return values for cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. The code spans identified in the search results include the class definition of AffinityPropagation and its methods such as __init__, fit, and predict. These methods are likely to contain the logic that determines the return values based on the convergence status.\n\nThe fit method is particularly important because it calls the affinity_propagation function, which likely handles the convergence check. This method sets the cluster_centers_indices_, labels_, and n_iter_ attributes. Examining this method will help understand how the convergence is determined and how the return values are set in case of non-convergence.\n\nThe predict method is also important as it handles the prediction of labels and includes a warning for the case where no cluster centers exist due to non-convergence. This method indicates how the algorithm behaves when trying to predict labels for new data after a non-convergent fit.\n\nBased on these observations, the following code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue: the __init__ method for parameter settings, the fit method for the convergence check and return value setting, and the predict method for handling predictions in case of non-convergence.",
