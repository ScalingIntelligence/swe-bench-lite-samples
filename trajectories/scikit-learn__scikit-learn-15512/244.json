The fit method processes the input data and calls the affinity_propagation function with the provided parameters. In the current implementation, there is no explicit check for convergence failure within the fit method. If the algorithm does not converge, it is not clearly documented how the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ are determined and whether they reflect non-convergence status in the expected way. The predict method handles the case of no cluster centers by returning -1 labels, but this only happens after the model has been fit. There is no clear indication within the fit method itself that it handles non-convergence explicitly by setting labels to -1 or returning an empty array for cluster centers.

The user is expecting to receive an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, but is experiencing different results. This discrepancy needs to be addressed within the codebase. \n\n1. Analyzing the <issue> tag: The user is concerned about the behavior of the `AffinityPropagation` clustering algorithm under non-convergence conditions. Specifically, the user expects to receive an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, based on the documentation. However, the user is observing different results and is seeking a more reliable way to detect non-convergence. \n\n2. Reviewing the current context in the <file_context> tag, we see the implementation of the `AffinityPropagation` class and its `fit` method, which includes the core logic for clustering. The `fit` method is responsible for determining `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`. \n\n3. Examining the new search results in the <search_results> tag, we come across the `affinity_propagation` function, which performs the actual affinity propagation algorithm. The function checks for convergence and determines the labels and cluster centers based on similar logic as the `fit` method. It sets `labels` to -1 for all samples and `cluster_centers_indices` to an empty list when no convergence is detected (K <= 0). \n\n4. Based on the analysis, both `span_ids` ('AffinityPropagation.fit' and 'affinity_propagation') are relevant to the reported issue. The 'AffinityPropagation.fit' span initializes and calls the affinity propagation algorithm, setting `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and other attributes. The 'affinity_propagation' span defines the logic for partitioning the data into clusters and includes decision points for handling non-convergence, where it sets the labels to -1 and cluster centers indices to an empty list if convergence hasn't occurred. \n\nTherefore, the two identified spans are critical for addressing the user's concerns and should be considered relevant to the reported issue.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
