The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for each training sample's label. However, the user observed different behavior in their specific example. The user is looking for a solution to determine if the clustering failed to converge without relying on the verbose option or checking if the maximum number of iterations was reached.\n\nThe most relevant code spans seem to be those that handle the convergence check and the assignment of labels and cluster centers. Here's a detailed analysis:\n\n1. '_equal_similarities_and_preferences': This function checks if all similarities and preferences are equal, which can be a condition that makes it impossible to converge.\n\n2. 'affinity_propagation': This function contains the main logic for the affinity propagation algorithm. It handles the iterations and checks for convergence.\n\n3. 'AffinityPropagation.__init__': This is the constructor for the AffinityPropagation class, which initializes the parameters like damping, max_iter, etc.\n\n4. 'AffinityPropagation.fit': This method implements the fitting process, including the creation of the affinity matrix and the call to the affinity_propagation function.\n\n5. 'AffinityPropagation.predict': This method predicts the cluster label for new data points. It deals with the case where there are no cluster centers due to non-convergence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those that involve the main logic of the algorithm, the handling of convergence, and the assignment of labels and cluster centers.

The function contains logic to handle the convergence and non-convergence scenarios.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
