The user expects specific return values for cluster centers and labels when the algorithm does not converge, according to the documentation. However, the observed behavior does not match these expectations. The search results focus on the `AffinityPropagation` class implementation in `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py`. We need to identify code spans relevant to the fit method which handles clustering and checks for convergence. The `fit` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class includes the call to `affinity_propagation`, which is crucial as it determines the cluster centers and labels. This method also handles the setting of `self.n_iter_`, which could be used to infer if the algorithm converged or not. We should examine how `affinity_propagation` processes and returns these values compared to what the documentation states. This method is relevant to addressing the issue as it directly involves the core logic of affinity propagation clustering and its convergence state.",
