The documentation suggests that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label. However, the example provided shows different behavior. To investigate this, we need to examine the AffinityPropagation class and its methods; specifically, the fit method which is responsible for training the model and determining cluster centers, and possibly the properties/methods associated with retrieving cluster center indices and labels. Additionally, checking for convergence status or the handling of non-convergence inside the AffinityPropagation class would be crucial. It's also worth looking at any warnings or exceptions related to convergence raised in the fitting process.",

According to the documentation, upon non-convergence, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the example provided shows different behavior, returning a cluster center and labels that suggest a converged state. The task is to identify the relevant parts of the code responsible for handling the convergence status and assigning values to cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. To address this, I inspected the AffinityPropagation class and its methods. The __init__ method sets up the parameters including max_iter and verbose. The fit method is crucial as it handles the main logic of the clustering process. Here, it calls the affinity_propagation function, passing important parameters like max_iter, convergence_iter, damping, and verbose. The results of this function are assigned to self.cluster_centers_indices_, self.labels_, and self.n_iter_. Analyzing this logic with the reported issue in mind, it appears that the fit method is central to understanding how convergence is checked and how the labels are assigned. Therefore, the spans AffinityPropagation.fit and its call to affinity_propagation within the fit method are identified as relevant.",

The fit method includes calls to check_array for input validation, and computes the affinity matrix based on the provided affinity type (either 'precomputed' or 'euclidean'). It then proceeds to call the affinity_propagation function to perform the actual clustering, capturing cluster center indices, labels, and the number of iterations. This clearly shows how the clustering operation is carried out and how important attributes like cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ are set. While the file context does not explicitly show the implementation of the affinity_propagation function or what happens on non-convergence, it highlights enough about the process to infer that the function would handle non-convergence and its implications on the output variables (cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_).

This function should handle the convergence check and set the `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` accordingly. \n\nIn the <search_results>, we find the `affinity_propagation` function which contains the logic for the algorithm. It sets the labels to [-1] * n_samples and cluster_centers_indices to an empty list if it determines that the algorithm did not converge. This seems to contradict the user's observation about receiving [2] as a cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as labels when the algorithm does not converge. \n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are the `AffinityPropagation.fit` method and the `affinity_propagation` function, particularly where the labels and cluster_centers_indices are set based on the convergence status.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
