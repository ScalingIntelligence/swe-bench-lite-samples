The documentation states that the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each training sample in labels_ when it does not converge. However, the user's experience shows that the algorithm returns incorrect cluster centers and labels.\n\nIn analyzing the provided code, I focused on identifying code spans relevant to the conditions under which the algorithm converges or does not converge. The constructor, __init__, sets up the parameters for the algorithm, but the main logic for the convergence is in the fit method. The fit method sets up the affinity matrix and calls the affinity_propagation function, which calculates the cluster centers and labels.\n\nI also noted that the predict method handles the case where the model does not have any cluster centers by returning -1 for each sample. However, the logic to set cluster_centers_ to an empty array when the algorithm does not converge is not explicitly found in the provided code spans. This implies that the expected behavior as documented is not being implemented correctly in the current code.\n\nBased on this analysis, the main code spans of interest are those dealing with the fit method, which constructs the affinity matrix and calculates the clusters, and the predict method, which manages predictions when there are no cluster centers.\n\nThis analysis leads me to select the relevant code spans to be those in the fit and predict methods of the AffinityPropagation class.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
