The user expects that in the case of non-convergence, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for each sample label, as stated in the documentation. However, the observed behavior is different, which may indicate a discrepancy between the documentation and the implementation.\n\nUpon examining the provided code spans, it appears that the `AffinityPropagation` class from the `sklearn.cluster._affinity_propagation` module is indeed responsible for implementing the Affinity Propagation algorithm. Key components that are relevant to the reported issue include:\n\n1. The `fit` method, which is responsible for training the model. This method includes the logic to compute the affinity matrix and the call to the `affinity_propagation` function to determine the cluster centers and labels. It also records the number of iterations run.\n\n2. The `predict` method, which is used to assign labels to new data points based on the trained model. This method includes a check for the presence of cluster centers and returns -1 for all samples if no cluster centers are found, which is in line with the expected behavior in case of non-convergence.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the code analysis, the most relevant code spans are those related to the `fit` method and the `predict` method, as they are directly involved in handling the clustering process and the output in case of non-convergence. These spans provide the necessary context to understand how the algorithm behaves when it does not converge and how labels are assigned.\n\nHowever, there does not seem to be an explicit check within the `fit` method to verify if the algorithm has converged, and whether it should return an empty array for the cluster centers and -1 for labels. Instead, the algorithm appears to handle non-convergence indirectly, relying on the presence or absence of cluster centers to determine the appropriate return values.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
