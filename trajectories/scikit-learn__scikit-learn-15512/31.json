According to the documentation, when the algorithm doesn't converge, it should return an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as the label for each training sample. However, the user encounters different behavior where the clustering returns cluster center indices and labels indicating convergence despite not actually converging.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are the initialization of the AffinityPropagation class, the fit method that performs the clustering, and the predict method that returns labels for new data. These methods appear to handle the behavior when the algorithm doesn't converge by updating cluster_centers_indices_, labels_, and n_iter_. The predict method also includes a warning and returns -1 if no cluster centers are found, which suggests handling for non-convergence. It's crucial to ensure that the actual behavior aligns with the documented behavior in all methods.\n\nGiven these code spans, they are likely relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the issue around handling non-convergence. The identified code spans suggest that the behavior might be correctly handled in the predict method but might not be fully addressed in the fit method's handling of the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. Further investigation into the affinity_propagation function that is called in the fit method would also likely provide insights into how non-convergence is managed there.",

The issue highlights that the expected behavior upon non-convergence is not met, specifically with the return values for cluster centers and labels. Next, I reviewed the current file context for any already identified relevant files and code spans. I then analyzed the new search results, focusing on sections that deal with the Affinity Propagation algorithm. I looked for code spans that handle the non-convergence scenario, including the handling of cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. The 'affinity_propagation' function was of particular interest as it processes the data and checks for convergence. Additionally, the 'AffinityPropagation' class and its methods, such as 'fit' and 'predict', were relevant as they use the results of the affinity_propagation function and handle the clustering outcome. The search results from 'sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py' and 'sklearn/utils/_testing.py' were also examined, but they mainly contain testing and utility functions that, while important, are not directly related to the non-convergence handling in the Affinity Propagation algorithm. Based on this analysis, the most relevant code spans are those from 'sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py' that deal with the Affinity Propagation class and its methods.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
