Specifically, the user expects to receive -1 labels for each sample when the algorithm does not converge, as per the documentation. However, in the provided example, the algorithm returns a cluster center and labels that do not indicate non-convergence. The issue suggests that there may be a discrepancy between the expected behavior described in the documentation and the actual implementation.\n\nAfter analyzing the current file context and the new search results, I've identified several key sections of code that are relevant to the reported issue. These sections include the `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class, which processes the input data and initializes the clustering process. It calls the `affinity_propagation` function, which handles the actual clustering algorithm and checks for convergence. Additionally, the `predict` method is relevant because it deals with assigning labels to new data points based on the trained model, and it includes a case for handling non-convergence by returning -1 labels.\n\nThe `affinity_propagation` function is critical as it contains the logic for determining if the algorithm has converged within the specified number of iterations. If it hasn't, the function sets the labels to -1 and logs a warning. This function aligns well with the reported issue as it directly checks for convergence and handles the case where the algorithm does not converge.\n\nBased on this analysis, I've identified the spans of code that are directly relevant to the issue, which include the `fit` and `predict` methods of the `AffinityPropagation` class and the `affinity_propagation` function, along with the paths to these code spans.",
