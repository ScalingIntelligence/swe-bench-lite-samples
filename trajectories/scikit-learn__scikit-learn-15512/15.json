Despite the documentation stating that it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, the provided example shows different output. To address this, we need to investigate the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function to understand how non-convergence is handled and why it deviates from the documented behavior. Additionally, we should look into the verbose behavior and convergence checks to see if there are any overlooked flags or properties that could indicate non-convergence more clearly.",

The expected behavior, as per the documentation, is to return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label when convergence does not occur. The user's observation, however, shows that this is not the case. The user is also requesting a way to reliably check for convergence without relying on the verbose option. The search results provided include the implementation of the `affinity_propagation` function and the `AffinityPropagation` class, from which we can analyze how the convergence is determined and how the results are returned. Specifically, the `affinity_propagation` function includes logic to handle non-convergence by setting `labels` to -1 and `cluster_centers_indices` to an empty array, which matches the documented behavior. The `AffinityPropagation` class integrates this function in its `fit` method to determine cluster centers and labels. From the provided code, it is evident that the `affinity_propagation` function and the `AffinityPropagation` class handle non-convergence as expected, raising a warning and setting labels to -1 and cluster centers to an empty array. Therefore, the relevant code spans for addressing the issue are those that handle the return values upon convergence failure.",

This behavior is consistent with the reported issue. However, the AffinityPropagation class does not explicitly check for non-convergence outside of the verbose flag. It might be beneficial to add a property or a more explicit check in the class to determine if the algorithm has converged for better user awareness.

The `affinity_propagation` function checks for convergence, and when it does not converge, it sets labels to [-1] * n_samples and cluster_centers_indices to an empty list. However, the `AffinityPropagation` class in the `fit` method does not explicitly handle or check for non-convergence other than through the `n_iter_` attribute.\n\nGiven the provided search results, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the implementation of the affinity propagation algorithm and how it handles the convergence criteria.

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
