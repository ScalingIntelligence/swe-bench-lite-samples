Specifically, the user is concerned about the lack of a clear indication in the returned values (cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_) that the algorithm did not converge, as stated in the documentation. The user provides an example where, despite non-convergence, the algorithm does not return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label. The user also mentions a workaround involving checking if max_iter == n_iter_ but expresses dissatisfaction with this approach.\n\nTo address this issue, I analyzed the provided search results, focusing on the AffinityPropagation class and its fit method. The fit method is responsible for executing the clustering algorithm and assigning values to cluster_centers_indices_, labels_, and n_iter_. I identified the relevant code spans for the fit method, as this is where the main logic resides for determining and returning the clustering results. In particular, the code span for AffinityPropagation.fit includes the call to the affinity_propagation function, where the cluster_centers_indices_, labels_, and n_iter_ are set based on the outcome of the clustering process.\n\nGiven this context, the relevant code spans to address the issue of non-convergence behavior are those within the fit method, as they directly handle the return values of the clustering algorithm. To ensure completeness, it is crucial to examine the entire fit method, including the handling of the affinity matrix and the conditions under which the affinity_propagation function is invoked.",

According to the documentation, the expected behavior is to return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices and -1 for each label when the algorithm doesn't converge. However, the user's experience shows that this is not the case, instead, it seems that the algorithm is returning cluster centers and labels that would indicate convergence, despite not having actually converged.\n\nThe relevant part of the code where the behavior around convergence is handled can be found in the 'affinity_propagation' function. This function is used within the 'fit' method of the AffinityPropagation class. Here, it can be observed that if the algorithm fails to converge within the given number of iterations (max_iter), it will still return some cluster centers and labels based on the current state of the algorithm, which might not be reflective of a true convergence.\n\nThis discrepancy between the expected and observed behavior aligns with the issue raised. The core processing logic that determines when the algorithm has not converged is not clearly resulting in the documented return output. It seems to be promoting non-converged states as converged, potentially misleading users about the true state of the clustering.\n\nTo address this, an enhancement could be made to the condition checking of convergence within the 'affinity_propagation' function or perhaps an additional property or method within the AffinityPropagation class to explicitly check and report the convergence state more clearly.\n\nThus, the identified relevant code spans are within both the 'AffinityPropagation' class methods and the 'affinity_propagation' function.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
