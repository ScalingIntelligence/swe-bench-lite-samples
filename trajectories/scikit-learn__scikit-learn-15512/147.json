The expected behavior, as described in the documentation, is to return an empty array for cluster center indices and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge. However, based on the user's example, this is not always the case. There is a need to accurately detect when the algorithm has not converged without relying on the verbose option. \n\nThe search results provide the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class in the sklearn library. It includes the initialization, fitting, and prediction methods. The fit method processes the data and computes the cluster centers and labels. The predict method labels new data based on the clustering results. \n\nThe relevant code spans for this issue are those that handle the convergence check and the assignment of labels in the case of non-convergence. The fit method and the predict method are particularly relevant. In the fit method, the affinity_propagation function is called, which should return the cluster centers and labels. If the algorithm does not converge, it should ideally return the expected values as per the documentation. The predict method also handles the labeling of new data, which should reflect the non-convergence status correctly. \n\nIt seems that the provided code spans are relevant as they directly deal with the fitting and prediction processes of the AffinityPropagation class, which are central to the reported issue. However, there is no explicit logic observed in the provided spans that directly checks for convergence or assigns -1 labels in case of non-convergence, suggesting that the codebase might not fully align with the documented behavior. This discrepancy warrants further investigation into the actual convergence checks and label assignment logic within the library. For now, focusing on the fit and predict methods aligns with the reported issue.",

This includes the fit method, which is responsible for performing affinity propagation clustering and setting the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ attributes. The context also includes the predict method, which handles labeling of new data points. The issue is related to behavior when the algorithm does not converge. The fit method calls the affinity_propagation function to perform the actual clustering, but it lacks specific handling for non-convergent situations as described in the issue. Additionally, the predict method handles the non-convergent scenario by returning -1 labels, which matches the user's expectation from the documentation but it seems the handling might be incomplete in the fit method. Therefore, more specific handling in the fit method for non-convergent scenarios, or more generally, better integration of non-convergence signal across fit and predict methods, might be needed to address the issue as reported.

The documentation states that upon non-convergence, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for each label. However, the example provided shows different output. To address this, I analyzed the relevant code spans in the 'AffinityPropagation' class and the 'affinity_propagation' function. The 'fit' method in the 'AffinityPropagation' class calls the 'affinity_propagation' function, which handles the core logic of the algorithm. Inside the 'affinity_propagation' function, there is a loop that iterates up to 'max_iter' iterations. If convergence is not achieved within this limit, the function issues a warning and sets labels to -1. This behavior aligns with the reported issue. Therefore, the existing code appears to handle non-convergence as documented, suggesting that the discrepancy might lie elsewhere or be due to a misunderstanding in the documentation. Reviewing the 'fit' method, 'predict' method, and the 'affinity_propagation' function thoroughly provides the necessary context to understand how the algorithm behaves upon non-convergence.",
