The user expects that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and `-1` for each label. However, the observed behavior is different. The user also mentions a workaround using the `verbose` option but finds it inconvenient. The search results provide the relevant code spans for the `AffinityPropagation` class in the `_affinity_propagation.py` file, including the `__init__` and `fit` methods. The `fit` method includes the call to the `affinity_propagation` function, which is crucial for understanding the logic behind the clustering process and its output. Given the user's concern, it would be beneficial to identify the code spans that handle the convergence check and the assignment of the `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` attributes. This can help in understanding if there's a bug or if the documentation needs updating. The analysis of the spans 'AffinityPropagation', 'AffinityPropagation.__init__', and 'AffinityPropagation.fit' is necessary to determine if these handle the non-convergence scenario correctly.",

The documentation states that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, in the provided example, the clustering returns [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels, which contradicts the documentation. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the AffinityPropagation class that handle the convergence behavior and the assignment of cluster_center_indices_ and labels_. From the search results, the 'fit' method of the AffinityPropagation class is the key place to look at because it calls the affinity_propagation function and assigns values to cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. This method should contain the logic for handling non-convergence and assigning the correct values as per the documentation. The relevant code spans are therefore the ones that involve the assignment of cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ during the fit method. Also, it's important to note that the initial impression of the documentation's correctness can be inaccurate as actual behavior might differ, so it's crucial to examine the code implementation to understand whether the documentation is correct or needs an update.",
