The main focus is on the `AffinityPropagation` class and its methods, particularly the `fit` method where the actual clustering is performed. The issue specifies that when the algorithm does not converge, the expected output is an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and a label of -1 for each training sample, which is not currently happening. I identified several relevant code spans in the `AffinityPropagation` class.\n\n1. **Initialization (`AffinityPropagation.__init__`)**: This method initializes the parameters such as `damping`, `max_iter`, `convergence_iter`, `copy`, `preference`, `affinity`, and `verbose`. These parameters are key to understanding the clustering configuration.\n\n2. **Fitting Data (`AffinityPropagation.fit`)**: This method takes the input data `X` and performs the clustering. The method constructs the `affinity_matrix_` and calls the `affinity_propagation` function to obtain the `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`. This is the core method where the issue of non-convergence should be handled.\n\n3. **Prediction (`AffinityPropagation.predict`)**: This method predicts the cluster label for new data points. It checks if the clustering converged by checking if there are any cluster centers. If not, it returns labels of -1, which could help in identifying non-convergence.\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant code spans are the ones that deal directly with the clustering process and handling of the cluster labels in the case of non-convergence.\n\nWhat's missing: The current implementation does not explicitly check for convergence and does not set the expected output for non-convergence as described in the issue. This involves modifying or adding checks in the `fit` method to adjust the outputs based on whether the algorithm converged or not.",

The user expects an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and '-1' labels for each sample, but their observed behavior does not match this expectation. The current implementation does not explicitly handle the non-convergence case as per the documentation, which might lead to confusion for users.\n\nFrom the existing code context and search results, we see that the `affinity_propagation` function and the `AffinityPropagation` class methods (``fit`` and `predict`) are key parts related to the issue. The `affinity_propagation` function is responsible for the actual clustering and handles the non-convergence scenario by setting labels to '-1' and returning an empty list for cluster centers if no convergence is detected. The `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class calls this function and assigns the results to `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_`. However, the observed behavior suggests that the non-convergence handling might not be functioning as expected.\n\nThe relevant code spans include all parts of the `affinity_propagation` function because it directly relates to the core functionality of the clustering process and its handling of convergence. Additionally, the `predict` and `fit` methods from the `AffinityPropagation` class are relevant because they interact with the results of the clustering process and need to reflect accurate information about convergence or lack thereof.\n\nThese code spans should provide a clear understanding of the current behavior and help identify if modifications are needed to align with the documented behavior or user expectations.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
