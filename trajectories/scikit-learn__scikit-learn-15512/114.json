From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are those that define the initialization, fit, and predict methods of the AffinityPropagation class. These methods contain the logic for clustering and handling the results, including the conditions under which the clustering does not converge. The fit method, in particular, processes the input data and assigns values to cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ based on the clustering results. The predict method handles the case where no cluster centers are available due to non-convergence and returns -1 labels accordingly.

The user observed that the expected output does not match the actual output in the case of non-convergence. According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 labels for all samples. However, the user's experience shows otherwise. The provided context and search results reveal parts of the code responsible for handling the convergence and non-convergence states of the Affinity Propagation algorithm. Specifically, the `fit` method sets up the algorithm and calls `affinity_propagation`, which is the core function handling the iteration process. The `predict` method also deals with the non-convergence state by issuing a warning and returning -1 labels. The search results include the `affinity_propagation` function, which contains the logic for convergence checks and handling the non-convergence scenario. When the algorithm does not converge, it issues a warning and sets labels to -1, which aligns with the documentation. However, the issue arises because the current implementation does not accurately capture the non-convergence state for the cluster centers when it fails to converge before reaching max_iter. It is essential to ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the behavior of the code and that the code correctly handles non-convergence for both cluster centers and labels. Therefore, the relevant code spans should include sections from both the `fit` method and the `affinity_propagation` function.",
