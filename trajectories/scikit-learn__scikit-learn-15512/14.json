Key sections to analyze include the __init__ method, which initializes the class parameters, the fit method, which is responsible for training the model, and the predict method, which handles prediction. Notably, the fit method includes the handling of convergence and computation of cluster centers and labels. The predict method includes logic to handle the case where no cluster centers are available due to non-convergence by returning -1 for each sample.

According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample. However, the user experiences different behavior in their use-case, where the algorithm returns [2] as cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as cluster labels for a non-converging case.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code, we can see that there is a specific handling for non-convergence in the 'affinity_propagation' function. When the algorithm does not converge, it sets 'labels' to np.array([-1] * n_samples) and 'cluster_centers_indices' to an empty list. This behavior aligns with the documentation.\n\nThe discrepancy might arise from how the 'fit' method of the AffinityPropagation class handles the results from the 'affinity_propagation' function. By examining the 'fit' method, we can see that it directly assigns the results from 'affinity_propagation' to self.cluster_centers_indices_, self.labels_, and self.n_iter_. If the 'affinity_propagation' function correctly handles non-convergence, then the issue might be in the interpretation or further handling of these results in the 'fit' method or other parts of the code.\n\nGiven the context and the provided code, the relevant spans to address the reported issue are those that deal with the handling of non-convergence in the 'affinity_propagation' function and the 'fit' method of the AffinityPropagation class.

According to the code, in cases of non-convergence, the function sets 'cluster_centers_indices_' to an empty list and assigns '-1' to all labels in 'labels_', which matches the expectation described in the reported issue.
