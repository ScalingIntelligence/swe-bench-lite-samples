However, the provided example shows that the algorithm returns [2] as cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as labels instead. This suggests a potential discrepancy between the implementation and the documented behavior.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans are located within the `AffinityPropagation` class, specifically within the `__init__` and `fit` methods. These methods define the parameters for the affinity propagation and the logic for fitting the model to the data. The `fit` method is of particular interest as it handles the actual clustering process and the conditions under which the algorithm might not converge.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to inspect the logic within the `fit` method related to handling non-convergence. The `fit` method calls the `affinity_propagation` function and assigns the results to `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`. The user's concern implies that there might be a need to explicitly check for non-convergence in a more user-friendly manner, possibly through a new property or by modifying the return values in case of non-convergence.",

The code does not explicitly handle the non-convergence scenario in a way that would yield the documented results. Specifically, the `affinity_propagation` function returns empty cluster_centers_indices and -1 labels only when no clusters are identified, which is different from the non-convergence case as presented in the issue.\n\nFrom the provided code spans, the critical part for understanding the return values is in the `affinity_propagation` function where, if no clusters are found (i.e., `K > 0` is false), it sets `labels` to an array of -1 and `cluster_centers_indices` to an empty list. This code logic explains the user's actual observations and suggests that the documentation might need an update to reflect the actual behavior of the algorithm when it doesn't converge.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to understanding the behavior of the `AffinityPropagation` class in the non-convergence scenario, but further investigation might be needed to determine if the documentation needs updating or if additional functionality should be added to distinguish non-convergence from cases where no clusters are identified.",
