The user is expecting specific return values when the clustering does not converge, as documented, but is observing different behavior in practice. We need to find the relevant code spans that handle the convergence check and the return values in such cases.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, we find a relevant code span in the 'affinity_propagation' function where the convergence is checked and the labels and cluster centers are determined. Specifically, there is a check for unconverged status and the assignment of labels as [-1] * n_samples and an empty list for cluster_centers_indices when the algorithm does not converge. This seems to align with the documented behavior but may not be correctly implemented or checked in the user's observed case.\n\nAdditionally, we have identified the 'AffinityPropagation' class and its methods, including 'fit' and 'predict', which are crucial for understanding how the affinity propagation clustering is executed and how the results are returned or predicted. These methods might need further inspection to ensure they correctly handle the convergence status and return the appropriate values when not converged.\n\nThus, the identified code spans seem relevant to investigate further to either confirm the implementation or find potential areas for improvement that could address the user's issue.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
