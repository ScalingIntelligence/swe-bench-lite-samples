According to the documentation, upon non-convergence, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label.

The `fit` method calculates the affinity matrix and then calls the `affinity_propagation` function, which is not shown in the provided code spans but would presumably handle the convergence logic and set `cluster_center_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_` accordingly.\n\nGiven the user's observation, there seems to be a discrepancy between the expected behavior based on the documentation and the actual implementation. The `convergence_iter` parameter in the `__init__` method suggests that there might be a mechanism for determining convergence, but it is unclear from the provided code how non-convergence is specifically handled and how the results are returned.\n\nThe search results also include exception classes in `sklearn/exceptions.py`, potentially relevant for raising a warning or error in case of non-convergence. However, no specific handling of non-convergence is explicitly shown in these code spans.\n\nTo address the issue, it would be beneficial to inspect the `affinity_propagation` function implementation, which was not included in the search results.

According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster center indices and labels of -1 for each training sample. However, the user's experience shows a different outcome. They are suggesting adding a property to check if the algorithm has converged or returning -1 values for labels when it does not converge. The user has provided a detailed setup and versions of libraries used.\n\nIn the file context, the AffinityPropagation class is defined with its fit method. This method is responsible for running the affinity propagation algorithm and setting the cluster center indices, labels, and the number of iterations. The user has suggested checking the number of iterations against the max iterations as a potential solution if the algorithm does not converge.\n\nThe search results include the ConvergenceWarning class, which is used to warn about issues during convergence. This might be relevant as it could be used to alert users if the algorithm has not converged.\n\nI will analyze the provided code spans from the file context to identify relevant spans for the reported issue. I will look for the logic that initializes, runs, and checks for convergence within the AffinityPropagation class. I will also evaluate how ConvergenceWarning might be integrated into the solution to provide feedback indicating non-convergence.",
