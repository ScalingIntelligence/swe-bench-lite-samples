The documentation suggests that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the example provided shows that the algorithm returns [2] as cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as cluster labels when the clustering does not converge. This discrepancy needs to be addressed.\n\nFrom the provided code context and search results, the relevant code spans are located in the `AffinityPropagation` class and the `affinity_propagation` function. Specifically, the `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class calls the `affinity_propagation` function and assigns its results to `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`. The `affinity_propagation` function is responsible for the actual clustering process and determines the cluster centers and labels. The logic for handling non-convergence is present in the `affinity_propagation` function, where it sets `labels` to `[-1]*n_samples` and `cluster_centers_indices` to an empty list if convergence does not occur. This logic aligns with the expected behavior as per the documentation.\n\nGiven the provided code context and search results, it seems that the current implementation of `affinity_propagation` does handle non-convergence correctly by setting `labels` to `[-1]*n_samples` and `cluster_centers_indices` to an empty list. The discrepancy in the example provided in the issue might be due to incorrect data or configuration that does not trigger the non-convergence handling code.

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
