According to the documentation, it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label when it doesn't converge. However, the example provided shows different results, indicating a mismatch between the documented behavior and the observed behavior. To address this, we need to search for the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function to understand how non-convergence is handled. We can also look at any related checks or warnings in the codebase regarding convergence.",

The user expects an empty array for cluster_centers_indices and -1 for labels in case of non-convergence. However, the observed behavior does not match this expectation, leading to potential misinterpretations of the clustering results. From the provided search results, it appears that the affinity propagation function and the AffinityPropagation class handle the non-convergence scenario by assigning -1 to labels and an empty list to cluster_centers_indices. Additionally, the ConvergenceWarning is used to warn about non-convergence, which is in line with enabling verbose for user awareness.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the code correctly implements the documented behavior for non-converged scenarios. However, the user's expectation from the example in the issue does not align with the documented return values, indicating a potential discrepancy. Need to further examine the function and class to confirm the handling of non-convergence and possibly adjust the documentation or implementation to better match user expectations without breaking existing functionality.",
