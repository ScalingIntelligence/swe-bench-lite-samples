This method is responsible for executing the clustering algorithm and setting the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ attributes. It uses the affinity_propagation function to perform the actual clustering. \n\nThe AffinityPropagation class's fit method does not directly address the non-convergence scenario by setting cluster_centers_indices_ to an empty array and labels_ to -1 for each sample.

The analysis of the provided search results and file context reveals multiple relevant spans, but it is crucial to verify the logic that determines the convergence state and the values returned when the algorithm does not converge. The relevant code spans in the provided file context include 'AffinityPropagation.fit', which calls the 'affinity_propagation' function, and the 'affinity_propagation' function itself, which contains the logic for the main loop and the convergence check. We see that the 'affinity_propagation' function updates the e array within the main loop and checks for convergence based on the values stored in this array. If the algorithm does not converge, it raises a ConvergenceWarning and sets the labels to [-1] * n_samples, which aligns with the desired behavior as described in the reported issue. However, upon reviewing the provided search results and the file context, there is no specific check or handling for cases where the algorithm has not converged but still provides cluster center indices and labels, which does not align with the documented behavior. Therefore, without additional code providing the mentioned check, we can conclude that the current implementation might not fully match the documented behavior where an empty array is returned for cluster centers and -1 for labels in case of non-convergence.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
