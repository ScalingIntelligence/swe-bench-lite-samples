The task is to identify relevant code spans that are crucial for handling the non-convergence scenario. The focus is on the `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class and how it determines and returns cluster centers and labels. We should also consider the `predict` method since it deals with the case where no cluster centers are found. The code provided shows the initialization and fitting process, including how the affinity matrix is computed and how the algorithm determines cluster centers and labels. The `predict` method handles the scenario where there are no cluster centers by returning -1 for labels.

Specifically, the issue describes the expected output versus the observed output and questions whether the documentation is incorrect. The current code provides a way to predict labels and handles the case when there are no cluster centers by issuing a ConvergenceWarning and returning -1 labels. The search results show the relevant parts of the AffinityPropagation class, including the initialization, fit method, and predict method. These methods are crucial for understanding how the algorithm handles convergence and what is returned in various scenarios. Based on the reported issue, the identified spans should focus on the parts of the code where the convergence is checked and the labels are assigned. The fit method includes the call to the affinity_propagation function, which is central to the issue as it calculates the cluster centers and labels. The predict method also handles the case when there are no cluster centers by returning -1 labels. Therefore, these sections of the code are relevant to the reported issue.",
