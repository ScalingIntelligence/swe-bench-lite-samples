The user expects an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, as stated in the documentation, but is observing different results in their specific scenario. The user also expresses a preference for a property or mechanism to easily check if the algorithm has converged without relying solely on verbose output. The existing code snippet within the <file_context> tag shows the initialization and fit method of the AffinityPropagation class in scikit-learn. This context helps in understanding where the clustering parameters are set and how the fit method is implemented. The <search_results> tag provides the full implementation of the affinity_propagation function, which is critical for understanding how convergence is handled and what values are returned in the case of non-convergence. Examining the `affinity_propagation` function reveals that when the algorithm doesn't converge and there are no clusters, it sets `labels` to an array of -1 the size of n_samples and returns an empty list for cluster_centers_indices, aligning with the documented behavior. The function also uses a condition involving 'convergence_iter' and 'max_iter' to check for convergence, which could be a useful property to expose for the user's request. Based on the alignment of the search results and the need to ensure the reported issue is addressed by checking for non-convergence without solely relying on verbose output, the identified spans from the search results should include the parts of the function that handle non-convergence and potentially the part where the check for convergence could be exposed more directly.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
