The search results provide the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class in scikit-learn's _affinity_propagation.py file. The relevant parts of the code include the fit method where the clustering is actually performed, and the predict method where predictions are made based on the clustering results. This provides a clear context for where the changes or checks should be made to handle non-convergence scenarios more effectively.

The documentation suggests that in case of non-convergence, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and a label of '-1' for each sample. However, the example shows that the algorithm returns unexpected cluster centers and labels even when it does not converge.\n\nTo address this issue, I have reviewed the code related to AffinityPropagation in the search results. I have identified the following key areas of interest:\n\n1. The `fit` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class initializes and executes the clustering process. It calls the `affinity_propagation` function to perform the clustering and assigns values to `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`.\n2. The `affinity_propagation` function handles the actual clustering logic, including checking for convergence. It updates the array `e` to track convergence status over iterations. If the algorithm does not converge within the allowed iterations, it sets the labels to '-1' and the cluster centers to an empty list.\n3. The `predict` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class handles the prediction of new data points. It includes logic to handle cases where the model has no cluster centers due to non-convergence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans seem relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the issue related to the return values of non-converged affinity propagation clustering.\n\nTo find a proper solution or uncover the root cause, one would have to dive deeper into how each function and parameter impacts the overall flow of the algorithm's execution and clustering decisions.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
