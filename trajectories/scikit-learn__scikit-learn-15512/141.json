The `affinity_propagation` function includes logic for identifying convergence and handling non-convergence cases, while the `AffinityPropagation` class uses this function in its `fit` method. Relevant spans include the `affinity_propagation` function and the `AffinityPropagation.fit` method, as they are directly responsible for processing the data and determining the outcome of the clustering.

Within these functions, there is a specific handling of non-convergence where it sets all labels to -1 and returns empty cluster centers when the algorithm does not converge. This behavior aligns with the expected outcome as described in the issue. Also, the fit method, which is used to train the model, includes the necessary logic to handle and report non-convergence cases.
