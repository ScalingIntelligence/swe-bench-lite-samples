The documentation mentions that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as the label for each training sample. However, the user experiences an outcome where the clustering does not converge but still returns cluster centers and labels, which contradicts the documented behavior. To address this, I analyzed the provided search results focusing on the AffinityPropagation class and its fit method. The fit method is the core function where clustering happens, and it calls the affinity_propagation function to perform the actual clustering. The parameters max_iter and verbose are relevant as they are mentioned in the user's issue. The control flow inside the fit method starts by checking the affinity type and then proceeds to compute the affinity matrix. It then calls the underlying affinity_propagation function with several parameters including max_iter, convergence_iter, and verbose. In this context, understanding how the affinity_propagation function handles non-convergence is crucial. If the function adheres to the documented behavior in the case of non-convergence, the issue might lie elsewhere, such as potential bugs or inconsistencies in handling the algorithmic results before they are returned to the user. Based on the analysis, I identified the fit method as likely relevant for further investigation to understand how the non-convergence situation is managed in code and whether it aligns with the documented behavior.",

Specifically, the issue is that the documentation suggests that when convergence does not occur, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label, but the observed behavior does not match this. The user provides an example where non-convergence results in [2] as cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as cluster labels instead of the expected empty list and [-1, -1, -1]. The user also suggests a potential solution to check if max_iter == n_iter_ to determine if the clustering failed. The provided context and search results include code spans from AffinityPropagation's fit and predict methods, as well as the affinity_propagation function. These are relevant because they directly address the behavior of the algorithm under non-convergence conditions. The identified code spans provide insights into how the algorithm processes input, computes cluster centers, and assigns labels. They also show how the algorithm handles the case of non-convergence, which aligns with the reported issue's concern. Therefore, based on the analysis of the reported issue and the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are in the fit and predict methods of the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
