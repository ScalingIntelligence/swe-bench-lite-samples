The documentation suggests that an empty array for cluster center indices and -1 labels should be returned when the algorithm does not converge. However, the observed behavior is different from documented expectations. The focus should be on the AffinityPropagation class in the _affinity_propagation.py file, where the fit method and properties related to cluster center indices and labels are defined. Additionally, the _equal_similarities_and_preferences function could be relevant if it affects the convergence checks. Investigating these components will help determine if the expected behavior is correctly implemented or if the documentation might need to be updated.",

The initialization of the 'AffinityPropagation' class (`__init__`) and the 'fit' method will particularly help in understanding the configuration and the execution of the clustering, including the handling of the affinity matrix and the prediction based on the clustering results.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
