The user is concerned about the discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual output when the algorithm fails to converge. The documentation suggests that in such cases, an empty array should be returned for cluster_center_indices_ and all labels should be -1. However, the user finds that the actual output includes cluster centers and labels indicating the clustering did not fail as expected.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, we see the `affinity_propagation` function and the `AffinityPropagation` class, which are directly related to the issue. The `affinity_propagation` function seems to be responsible for the clustering logic, including handling the convergence and non-convergence scenarios. Upon non-convergence, it sets `labels` to `[-1] * n_samples` and `cluster_centers_indices` to an empty list. This aligns with the documentation.\n\nHowever, the user's experience suggests that the expected behavior is not consistently observed. Reviewing the `AffinityPropagation` class methods, particularly `fit` and `predict`, helps understand how the results are handled after running the affinity propagation algorithm. In `predict`, when no cluster centers are found (indicating non-convergence), it sets all labels to -1, which agrees with the user's expectation if they detect non-convergence correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are those that deal with handling convergence and non-convergence, particularly in the `affinity_propagation` function and in the `predict` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class. These sections should be inspected to ensure the correct output behavior and possibly to introduce additional checks for convergence state.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
