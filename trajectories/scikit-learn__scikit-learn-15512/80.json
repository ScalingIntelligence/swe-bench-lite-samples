According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and -1 for each label. However, the user experiences different behavior, potentially indicating a discrepancy in the implementation. To address this, we need to focus on the relevant code sections that handle the convergence and non-convergence scenarios of the Affinity Propagation algorithm. From the provided file context and search results, the relevant code spans include the `affinity_propagation` function, the `AffinityPropagation` class, and its methods such as `__init__`, `fit`, and `predict`. These sections are crucial for understanding how the algorithm handles non-convergence and how the results are returned. The input includes specific versions of dependencies, suggesting that the issue might be version-specific or related to how the algorithm is implemented in the specified environment. The task is to identify the sections of code that are responsible for handling the non-convergence scenario and verify if they align with the documented behavior. Given the context, we should focus on the sections where the non-convergence is detected, the labels and cluster centers are assigned, and any potential discrepancies from the documented behavior are examined.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
