Specifically, it questions the return values when the algorithm does not converge, as per the documentation, it should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for all labels. However, the observed behavior is different. In the provided search results, I identified the relevant sections that handle the logic for convergence and the return values when the algorithm doesn't converge. At the end of the 'affinity_propagation' function, there is logic to check for convergence and handle the return values accordingly. If the algorithm does not converge, it sets labels to -1 and returns an empty list for cluster centers. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the documentation. Hence, it appears that the documentation is accurate, and the behavior is implemented correctly in the code. This suggests that the issue might be a misunderstanding or a specific case not accounted for in the initial investigation. To ensure completeness, I reviewed the entire section of code responsible for handling the convergence and return values and did not find any discrepancies. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete as the relevant code spans have been identified and they support the documented behavior.",

The user's expectation is to get an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample when the algorithm does not converge, as per the documentation. However, the observed behavior is different, with the algorithm returning cluster centers and labels even when it does not converge. The user suggests an improvement by adding a property to check if the algorithm has converged, or to return -1 values for labels when convergence fails. Additionally, the user is concerned about the conditionality of the convergence verification in the current implementation. To address this, I reviewed the provided file context and the new search results. From the file context, it seems that the `affinity_propagation` function and the `AffinityPropagation` class handle the logic related to setting cluster centers and labels. The search results confirm the presence of the `AffinityPropagation` class and its methods for fitting and predicting. Both contexts show that when the algorithm does not converge, it issues a ConvergenceWarning and sets the labels to -1 only if there are no cluster centers, which seems to contradict the documentation and user's expectations, as they expect -1 labels regardless of the presence of cluster centers. The part about checking the actual condition for convergence (max_iter == n_iter_) does not appear explicitly in the provided code but influences the logic around setting and checking the cluster label definitions.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
