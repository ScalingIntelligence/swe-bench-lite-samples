The 'fit' method initializes and runs the algorithm, storing the results in 'cluster_centers_indices_' and 'labels_'. The 'predict' method is used to predict the cluster centers for new data points and handles the case where no cluster centers are available due to non-convergence by returning an array of -1 labels with a warning.

The issue also mentions a preference for -1 values or a property to check convergence.\n\nReviewing the current file context, I see that the `AffinityPropagation` class has a `fit` method that calls `affinity_propagation` to compute cluster centers and labels. The `predict` method handles the scenario where there are no cluster centers by warning and returning -1 labels.\n\nIn the new search results, I found the `affinity_propagation` function that does the main computation. This function checks for convergence and handles cases where it does not converge by setting labels to -1 and cluster centers to an empty array. This behavior seems to align with the documented expected output in the reported issue. I also see handling for mutually equal similarities and initialization of matrices for computation.\n\nOverall, the relevant code spans can be identified as those handling the implementation and behavior of the affinity propagation algorithm, especially concerning convergence and what to return in case of non-convergence.",
