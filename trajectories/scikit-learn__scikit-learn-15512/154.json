According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each sample in labels_. However, the user's experience suggests a different outcome, where they observe [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels when the clustering does not converge. The user is seeking a more reliable way to determine convergence without relying on the verbose option. \n\nUpon analysis of the provided code spans, it becomes clear that the current implementation does handle the non-convergence scenario by setting cluster_centers_indices_ to an empty array and labels_ to all -1 values. This handling occurs in the `fit` method, where after calling the `affinity_propagation` function, the results are assigned to `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_`. This suggests that the documentation aligns with the code's intended behavior but there might be a bug in the actual execution that deviates from this behavior under certain conditions.\n\nGiven the current context and the search results, the relevant code spans that address the reported issue are those associated with the initialization, fitting, and prediction methods of the AffinityPropagation class. These spans involve the handling of the affinity matrix, the control of the iterative process, and the assignment of labels based on the clustering results. I will now extract these code spans to assist in further debugging and to ensure that the non-convergence scenario is correctly handled as per the documentation.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
