The documentation states that non-convergence should result in an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 labels for each sample. However, the observed behavior differs. To resolve this, we need to investigate the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function, focusing on how non-convergence is detected and handled. Furthermore, we should check if any related checks or properties can assist in determining convergence status.",

The user expects specific return values in such cases, but current behavior does not match the expectations. The issue is relevant to determining convergence, handling of non-convergence cases and the consistency with the documentation.\n\nI have analyzed several files and code spans and found some that are highly relevant to the issue. These include methods from the AffinityPropagation class such as `fit`, `predict` and the `affinity_propagation` function. These parts of the code handle the clustering process, determine the cluster centers and labels, and conditionally assign labels or raise warnings based on the convergence status.\n\nThe `affinity_propagation` function seems crucial as it directly implements the Affinity Propagation algorithm, which is likely where the behavior relevant to the user's concern is located. The `fit` method in the AffinityPropagation class is also important as it calls `affinity_propagation`, processes and stores the results including the `n_iter_` property that could be relevant in checking for convergence.\n\nThe issue could be addressed by modifications in these identified parts, adding or modulating the logic to handle instances of non-convergence as per the expected behavior or by introducing a property to easily check for convergence status independently of reaching the maximum number of iterations.\n\nThese considerations lead me to conclude that the search results are relevant to the reported issue because they cover core functionality related to AffinityPropagation's clustering and handling non-convergence scenarios.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
