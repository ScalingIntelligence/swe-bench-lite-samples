According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for `cluster_center_indices_` and `-1` for each label in `labels_`. However, in the provided example, the algorithm returns non-empty `cluster_center_indices_` and non-`-1` values for `labels_`. This discrepancy needs investigation within the codebase of `AffinityPropagation` specifically.

The user expected to receive specific return values in case of non-convergence which are documented but not observed in practice. The user is seeking a reliable way to determine if the clustering has converged without relying on verbose output or hacking into the iteration checks.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans, the 'fit' method of the AffinityPropagation class seems relevant. This method handles the core clustering process, including setting up the affinity matrix and calling the internal affinity_propagation function. There are also spans discussing the behavior of the 'predict' method in the context of providing labels and handling non-convergence scenarios.\n\nGiven the issue, the key areas to look at are how the algorithm checks for convergence and what it returns in case of non-convergence. The 'fit' method sets up and runs the affinity propagation and captures the results in 'cluster_centers_indices_', 'labels_', and 'n_iter_'. The 'predict' method handles the scenario where there are no cluster centers by returning -1 for labels, which could indicate non-convergence to a user. Based on this understanding, I will identify spans in the 'fit' and 'predict' methods as relevant to the reported issue.",

The new search results include the affinity_propagation function, which is crucial for understanding the logic behind the clustering process and how non-convergence is handled. The function details the steps involved in the affinity propagation algorithm, including the conditions under which convergence is checked and how labels are assigned when the algorithm does not converge. This information is vital for addressing the user's concern about detecting non-convergence accurately without relying solely on verbose output or checking the iteration count against max_iter. By analyzing these code spans, it becomes clear that the current implementation assigns clusters and indices based on the conditions met during iterations, and it provides a warning and labels of -1 when no convergence occurs.
