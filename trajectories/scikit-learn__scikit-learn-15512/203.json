The documentation indicates that in such cases, it should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label in labels_. However, the observed behavior seems to conflict with this documented behavior. To resolve this, we need to trace the implementation of AffinityPropagation to verify its behavior when convergence does not occur. This will involve checking the internals of the fit method and the attributes cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ to see how they are set in non-convergence scenarios.",

The user expects that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for each label. However, the observed behavior seems to contradict this expectation. The search results provided contain crucial spans that detail the implementation of the affinity propagation algorithm and the AffinityPropagation class. These spans include the logic for checking convergence, handling the case of no convergence, and the method of labeling in such cases. Notably, the 'affinity_propagation' function and the 'fit' method within the AffinityPropagation class are particularly relevant. These sections contain the logic for determining and handling non-convergence, and they align with the user's concern about the method used to indicate non-convergence. Based on the provided code spans, it appears that the current implementation does handle non-convergence but not necessarily in the way the user expects. The identified spans will be sufficient to address the issue reported by the user.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
