The documentation states that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the user's example demonstrates that the current implementation does not adhere to this expectation, returning [2] for cluster_centers_indices_ and [0,0,0] for labels despite non-convergence.\n\nTo address this issue, it is necessary to examine the implementation of the `fit` method in the AffinityPropagation class. This method is responsible for performing the clustering and setting the `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` attributes. It is within this method that the logic for determining convergence and setting the appropriate values in case of non-convergence should be found.\n\nFrom the search results, the `fit` method initializes and calculates `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_` using the `affinity_propagation` function. However, there is no explicit check within the provided code span to handle non-convergence specifically by setting `labels_` to [-1] or `cluster_centers_indices_` to an empty array. This omission may explain the discrepancy between the documented behavior and the observed behavior.\n\nTherefore, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue would be those related to the `fit` method, particularly where `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` are assigned, to ensure proper handling of non-convergence.",

The documentation suggests that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices and -1 for each label. However, the actual output provided does not match this expectation.\n\nUpon examining the current code context and the newly provided search results, it becomes clear that the core logic for Affinity Propagation is within the 'affinity_propagation' function. This function contains the main loop responsible for iterating and updating the responsibilities (R) and availabilities (A) until convergence or the maximum number of iterations is reached. The logic handling the case where the algorithm does not converge is found within this function, specifically in the else block after the loop.\n\nThe fault lies within this else block. When the algorithm does not converge, cluster_centers_indices should be empty and labels should be -1 for every point to indicate non-convergence, as stated in the documentation. This does not appear to be properly implemented in the code.\n\nFor the proposed fix, one would need to change the code within the else block to set cluster_centers_indices to an empty list and labels to -1 for every point. This change should align with the documented behavior and better communicate non-convergence to users.\n\nI would suggest implementing this fix in sklearn.cluster._affinity_propagation where the handling of non-convergence is located.",
