This matches the documented behavior for non-convergence. The issue might stem from a misunderstanding of how `affinity_propagation` handles non-convergence or an edge case not covered by the current implementation.

The user is looking for a way to detect non-convergence without relying on verbose output, and expects the algorithm to return specific values indicating failure. Upon examining the current file context and new search results, it is evident that the `AffinityPropagation` class and its methods, particularly `fit` and `predict`, are central to addressing this issue. The `fit` method shows how the algorithm processes the data, while the `predict` method handles predictions based on the results of the `fit` method. There are, however, no specific checks within these spans that directly address the non-convergence issue. To solve the user's problem, additional logic would need to be implemented to detect non-convergence and ensure the returned cluster centers and labels align with expected failure values, or a new property might be introduced to indicate convergence status. The provided code does not currently handle non-convergence as the user expects, but it does provide a direction for modifying or extending the current functionality to meet the user's requirements.",
