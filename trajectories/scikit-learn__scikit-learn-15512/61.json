This behavior is not observed in the provided example, leading to questions about the discrepancy between the documentation and actual implementation. The search results and the file context provided include the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and the underlying affinity_propagation function, which are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the issue. The analysis of these code spans reveals that the actual handling of non-convergence in the AffinityPropagation class is different from what the documentation states.
