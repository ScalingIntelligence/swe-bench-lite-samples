The issue specifically focuses on the expected behavior when the algorithm does not converge, which according to the documentation should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the provided example shows different results, indicating a potential discrepancy or bug in the implementation. I identified several relevant code spans in the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function that handle the clustering process, convergence checks, and return values. These spans are crucial for understanding how the algorithm behaves when it does not converge and how the returned values are determined. I also noticed the use of ConvergenceWarning and the verbose option, which are relevant to the issue. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the convergence check, the handling of non-converged states, and the assignment of labels and cluster centers.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
