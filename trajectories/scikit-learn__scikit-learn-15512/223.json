The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample. However, the user observed different behavior in their example. To address this, I examined the code spans related to the Affinity Propagation algorithm. The 'AffinityPropagation.fit' method sets up and runs the affinity propagation algorithm, while the 'affinity_propagation' function handles the core logic of the algorithm, including convergence checks and label assignment. In the 'affinity_propagation' function, there is a check for convergence using the 'convergence_iter' parameter and the 'e' array. If the algorithm does not converge, it assigns -1 to 'labels' and returns an empty list for 'cluster_centers_indices'. This behavior is consistent with the documentation, suggesting that the issue might be related to a specific implementation detail not covered here.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
