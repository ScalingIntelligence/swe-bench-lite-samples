The user is seeking a way to determine if the clustering has failed to converge without relying solely on the verbose option. The provided search results contain the `AffinityPropagation` class definition which includes the `fit` method where the clustering logic is implemented. The `fit` method sets the `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` attributes based on the result of the `affinity_propagation` function. However, there is no explicit handling for the case when the algorithm does not converge, which aligns with the user's concern. The `predict` method does handle the case where there are no cluster centers by returning -1 for each sample, but this handling is after the fact and not directly tied to convergence.

To address this, we need to examine the code related to the convergence check and the return values in the `AffinityPropagation` class and the `affinity_propagation` function.\n\n1. In the `AffinityPropagation` class, the `fit` method calls the `affinity_propagation` function and assigns the results to `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`. This suggests that the logic for handling non-convergence should be within the `affinity_propagation` function.\n\n2. In the `affinity_propagation` function, we see a loop that iterates up to `max_iter` times. The convergence is checked by verifying if the number of clusters (`K`) is greater than 0 or if the iteration count reaches `max_iter`. If there are no clusters, it sets the labels to -1 and the cluster centers to an empty list.\n\n3. The user's example indicates that the algorithm does not produce the expected result of an empty cluster center and -1 labels, suggesting a potential issue in the convergence logic or the handling of non-convergence states.\n\nGiven the current context and the provided code, I will identify the relevant spans that could help in understanding and potentially addressing the issue.",
