The relevant code spans to investigate are those related to the initialization, fitting, and prediction methods of the AffinityPropagation class. These methods determine how the status of the convergence is handled and how the results are returned. Specifically, the 'fit' method should be examined to see if it properly handles the non-convergence scenario, and whether the 'predict' method correctly returns -1 for labels when no cluster centers are identified. Furthermore, checking the 'fit_predict' method can provide additional context on how the clustering results are processed post-fitting.

The issue focuses on the expected behavior of the AffinityPropagation algorithm when it does not converge and how it currently handles such situations. The user expects an empty array for cluster_centers_indices and labels of -1 for each sample when the algorithm does not converge, but the current implementation does not behave this way, leading to confusion. \n\nNext, I reviewed the current context provided in the <file_context> tag. It includes a class definition for AffinityPropagation and its methods like __init__, fit, and predict. The fit method is particularly important as it's where the clustering happens and where the behavior should align with the documented expected outputs. However, the implemented behavior does not currently match the documentation or user expectations in case of non-convergence.\n\nI then analyzed the new search results provided in the <search_results> tag. This section includes the affinity_propagation function with its detailed implementation. Inside this function, the conditions for convergence are checked during iterations, and if they are not met beyond the maximum number of iterations, the function handles the non-convergence scenario by setting labels to -1 and notifying a warning. This part of the code directly relates to the issue raised, especially in how it deals with non-converged clustering instead of the expected behavior documented.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans that address the reported issue are those that handle the non-convergence conditions within the affinity_propagation function. I have identified the relevant span IDs within the function that specifically deal with this logic and will mark these as relevant to the issue.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
