To address this, the search should focus on the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function where the clustering logic resides. Specifically, we need to find the logic responsible for checking and setting labels and cluster center indices upon non-convergence.",

The user mentions that the documentation states that in case of non-convergence, the algorithm should return an empty array for `cluster_center_indices_` and -1 for each label. However, the user experiences different behavior in their script. They expect to see an empty list and [-1,-1,-1] as labels but get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels instead. The analysis of the search results shows that the `affinity_propagation` function and the `AffinityPropagation` class handle the non-convergence by setting labels to -1 and cluster_center_indices to an empty list, which aligns with the documentation. The discrepancy observed in the user's script might be due to some other factors not detailed in the provided search results. Additionally, the search results provide context for how convergence is checked (`unconverged` variable) and how verbose mode is implemented, which could be useful for the user's requested functionality to check convergence more directly.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
