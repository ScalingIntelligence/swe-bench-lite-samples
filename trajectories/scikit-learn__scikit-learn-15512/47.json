The relevant files to inspect are those related to the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function, as well as any utility functions or exception classes that might handle convergence warnings or errors.

The user expects that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for all labels, as stated in the documentation. However, they observe different behavior in their example, where the algorithm returns non-empty cluster centers and labels. The user also mentions a workaround involving the verbose option but seeks a more reliable method to check convergence.\n\nExamining the search results, we find relevant code spans in 'sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py'. This file contains the main implementation of the AffinityPropagation algorithm, including the 'affinity_propagation' function and the 'AffinityPropagation' class. The 'affinity_propagation' function handles the core clustering logic, including checking for convergence and assigning cluster centers and labels. When the algorithm does not converge, it sets labels to -1 and cluster centers to an empty array, which seems to align with the documented behavior the user expects. However, the observation of non-empty cluster centers and labels in the provided example suggests a potential discrepancy or a specific condition not met within the provided code. Further analysis would be necessary to determine why the expected behavior is not observed in the specific example given by the user.\n\nThe 'AffinityPropagation' class and its 'fit' method are also relevant, as they handle the input data and call the 'affinity_propagation' function. The 'fit' method sets up the affinity matrix and preference based on the input parameters and then proceeds with the clustering. Understanding how this method interacts with the 'affinity_propagation' function could provide insights into why the reported behavior discrepancy occurs.\n\nBased on the current search results, I will provide the identified relevant code spans.",
