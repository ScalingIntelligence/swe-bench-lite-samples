To address this issue, it's essential to examine the code related to the AffinityPropagation class and its fit method, particularly where the convergence and return values are handled. From the provided search results, it's clear that the AffinityPropagation class initializes various parameters including max_iter and convergence_iter. The fit method processes the input data, computes the affinity matrix, and then calls the affinity_propagation function to perform the actual clustering. It's here where the return values for cluster centers and labels are set, based on the outcome of the affinity_propagation function. A closer look at how convergence is checked and how these return values are determined would be crucial to understand and potentially correct the behavior observed by the user.

The concern is centered around the expected return values of the algorithm when it fails to converge, as per the documentation, and the actual observed behavior. My analysis revealed that the method `affinity_propagation` within the `_affinity_propagation.py` file contains the logic determining the return values when the algorithm does not converge. Specifically, it sets the `labels` to `[-1] * n_samples` and `cluster_centers_indices` to an empty list if it doesn't converge, which aligns with the documented behavior.
