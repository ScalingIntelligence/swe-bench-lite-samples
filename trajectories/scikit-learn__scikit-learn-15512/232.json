The user expects specific outputs when the clustering does not converge as per the documentation, but they see different results. Specifically, they expect an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and labels_ of -1 for each sample when the algorithm does not converge. However, they get different values which suggests a discrepancy or misunderstanding in the documentation.\n\nTo address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the non-convergence scenario in the Affinity Propagation implementation in scikit-learn. We should look for where the labels and cluster centers are set when the algorithm does not converge. Additionally, there might be a need to add a property or modify the behavior to more explicitly indicate non-convergence for the user.\n\nIn the provided search results, the function 'affinity_propagation' and the class 'AffinityPropagation' are relevant. Within 'affinity_propagation', the section where it handles non-convergence by setting labels to -1 and cluster_center_indices to an empty list is particularly important. Also, in the 'AffinityPropagation' class, the initialization, fitting, and prediction methods are central, especially the 'fit' method as it interacts directly with 'affinity_propagation' to determine the results based on convergence or not.\n\nThese sections are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior to better align with user expectations and the documentation when the algorithm fails to converge.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
