The detailed examination of the 'fit' and 'predict' methods reveals how the results are processed and returned, which is crucial for understanding the divergence from expected behaviors. Furthermore, the 'predict' method includes handling for cases where no cluster centers exist due to non-convergence, indicating where potential update points might be for achieving the documented behavior.

The expected behavior, according to the documentation, is to return an empty array for cluster center indices and -1 for each label when convergence fails. However, the user reports that this is not the case, and they suggest a preferable output or a property to indicate convergence status.\n\nFrom the current file context, we can see that the `AffinityPropagation` class in `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py` handles the fitting and prediction processes. The `fit` method calculates cluster centers and labels, and the `predict` method checks for convergence based on the presence of cluster centers. If there are no cluster centers, it returns -1 for all labels, which aligns with the user's expectation.\n\nIn the new search results, the `affinity_propagation` function is the main function that performs the affinity propagation algorithm. It handles the iterations and convergence checks. When the algorithm does not converge, it sets the labels to -1 and the cluster centers to an empty list, which also matches the user's expectation. However, the user notes that the actual behavior observed does not align with this.\n\nTo address the user's concern, it might be necessary to further investigate the conditions under which the algorithm reports non-convergence and ensure that it indeed sets the labels to -1 and the cluster centers to an empty list in such cases. It would also be beneficial to provide a more direct way to check for convergence status, possibly through a new property or a modification to the existing handling of convergence.\n\nBased on the current analysis, the relevant code spans are the ones related to the `fit`, `predict`, and `affinity_propagation` methods, as they deal directly with the behavior concerning convergence.",
