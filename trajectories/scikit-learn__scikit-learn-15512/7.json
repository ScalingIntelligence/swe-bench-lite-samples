The documentation states that an empty array should be returned for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each training sample as labels. However, in the example provided, the clustering results indicate a different behavior when convergence fails. Reviewing the search results, the relevant code spans appear to be within the AffinityPropagation class. The constructor (__init__), the fit method, and the predict method are particularly relevant. The fit method initializes and processes the affinity matrix, performing the clustering and setting the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. The predict method handles the prediction of new data points, including handling cases where there are no cluster centers due to non-convergence. This suggests that the core functionality which might need adjustment or inspection is located within these methods. No indication of additional properties to check convergence apart from the verbose option and comparison of max_iter with n_iter_ is found in the provided spans. The analysis concludes that the identified code spans within the AffinityPropagation class are relevant to the reported issue, especially for understanding and potentially modifying the handling of non-convergence situations.",
