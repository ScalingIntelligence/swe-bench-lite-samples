The user expects specific return values in such scenarios, as documented, but is observing different results in practice. This discrepancy suggests potential issues with the implementation or documentation of the algorithm's behavior upon non-convergence. The provided code spans for the AffinityPropagation class are comprehensive and cover the initialization, fitting, and prediction methods. Notably, the `fit` method sets the `self.cluster_centers_indices_` and `self.labels_` attributes based on the results of the `affinity_propagation` function, which is key to understanding how convergence is handled. Additionally, the `predict` method includes a check for the presence of cluster centers and returns a warning or -1 labels if no cluster centers are found, which aligns with the behavior described in the documentation as expected by the user after non-convergence. Based on the provided code, these sections seem relevant to addressing the issue. They clarify how the algorithm processes and returns results upon convergence, which directly relate to the user's reported concern. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to solving the issue.",

However, the specific handling of non-convergence (returning an empty array and -1 labels) as documented doesn't seem to be explicitly implemented in the code snippet provided. This might suggest a deeper look into how the convergence is determined and how labels are assigned in the case of non-convergence.
