The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each training sample in labels_. However, the user experiences an unexpected result where the cluster centers and labels are not being set as per the documentation described behavior. To address this, it's necessary to find out how the convergence of the algorithm is handled in the code and verify if there's an inconsistency between the documentation and the implementation. From the provided search results, the 'AffinityPropagation' class and its methods including 'fit' and 'predict' are relevant. The 'fit' method needs a detailed review to understand when and how convergence is checked, or if it's handled correctly for non-convergence scenarios. Additionally, the 'predict' method should handle non-convergence cases appropriately, which it seems to do by returning '-1' labels as mentioned in the warning message. This indicates that the methods currently understand what to do under non-convergence situations, but the behavior during fit might be at odds with expected documentation behavior.\n\n",

This can be done by modifying the part of the code that handles non-convergence to match the documented behavior.\n\nThe instructions require updating the handling of non-convergence in the affinity propagation function. The current handling of non-convergence is already partially implemented from line 225 to 226, but it does not fully comply with the documented behavior mentioned in the instructions. Specifically, the current code only sets labels to -1 and does not handle the cluster_centers_indices as an empty array. To correct this, the code from line 216 to 226 must be adjusted to return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices as well.",
