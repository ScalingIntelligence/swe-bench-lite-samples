The user expects specific return values in case of non-convergence, as indicated by the documentation, but is experiencing different results. This discrepancy could be due to a bug or an incorrect assumption about the expected behavior. To address this, we need to examine key methods within the AffinityPropagation class, particularly the fit and predict methods, to understand how they handle and report the convergence status. The fit method is where the main clustering algorithm is applied, and it returns cluster center indices and labels. The predict method is used for assigning new data points to existing clusters but also includes special handling for cases where no clusters were found due to non-convergence. Given the user's concern, we should look for any checks or conditions within these methods that handle the non-convergence scenario, especially how they set or update the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ attributes. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those that define the fit and predict methods within the AffinityPropagation class, as they directly affect the outputs mentioned in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
