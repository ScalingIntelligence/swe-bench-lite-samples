The issue suggests that the current behavior does not align with the documentation, which states that in case of non-convergence, an empty array should be returned for `cluster_centers_indices_` and `-1` for labels. However, the provided example indicates that the clustering results are not as expected. The relevant code spans to investigate include the `fit` method, which handles the clustering process, and the `predict` method, which assigns labels. Notably, the `fit` method does not explicitly handle the non-convergence scenario by setting labels to `-1`, which suggests an oversight in the current implementation. Additionally, the relationship between `max_iter` and `n_iter_` should be considered for detecting non-convergence accurately. Therefore, the identified spans focus on the `fit` and `predict` methods, which are central to the clustering process and label assignment.",

The user expects that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 labels for each sample, as documented. However, the observed behavior differs, with cluster centers and labels being returned despite non-convergence. The user seeks a way to detect non-convergence without relying on the verbose option or checking the number of iterations. After reviewing the existing code, it is evident that the fit method of the AffinityPropagation class calls the affinity_propagation function and assigns the results to cluster_centers_indices_, labels_, and n_iter_. The affinity_propagation function contains the logic for checking convergence and setting labels to -1 if convergence does not occur. Analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the issue lies in how the affinity_propagation function handles convergence. The function correctly assigns -1 labels when there are no cluster centers, but the fit method in the AffinityPropagation class should handle these cases in a way that mirrors the expected behavior from the documentation. The search results confirm the presence of relevant code in the sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py file, specifically focusing on the affinity_propagation function and the fit method within the AffinityPropagation class.
