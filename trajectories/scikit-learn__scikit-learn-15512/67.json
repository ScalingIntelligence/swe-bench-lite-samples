The user expects to receive an empty array for cluster_centers_indices and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, as stated in the documentation. However, the observed behavior does not match this expectation. \n\nFrom the provided context and search results, it is clear that the main logic for the Affinity Propagation algorithm is in the `affinity_propagation` function and the `fit` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class. The `affinity_propagation` function handles the core clustering logic and checks for convergence based on the number of iterations and the convergence criteria. When the algorithm does not converge, it alerts the user and sets the labels to -1. However, the `fit` method does not explicitly check for convergence status and hence doesn't set the return values as expected by the user.\n\nThe search results provide a detailed look at how the algorithm is implemented and how it handles non-convergence. In the case of non-convergence, the `affinity_propagation` function issues a warning and sets the labels to -1, but this behavior might not be fully propagated back to the user interface or reported correctly to the user. The `AffinityPropagation` class needs a way to expose this convergence status or modify its return values based on this status to address the user's concern.\n\nBased on the issue and the given context, the identified code spans involve the `affinity_propagation` function and the `fit` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class. These sections are critical for understanding and implementing a solution to accurately reflect the convergence status in the return values.",
