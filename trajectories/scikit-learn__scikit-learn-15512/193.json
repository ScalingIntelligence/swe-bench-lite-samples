There are checks for the affinity type to determine how the affinity matrix is computed, and then the clustering results are captured in `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`. Since `n_iter_` is part of the returned values, this attribute might be what we should focus on to ascertain the convergence status.

The issue states that the documentation suggests that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the user's example shows different results, indicating a possible discrepancy between the documentation and the actual implementation.\n\nTo address this, we need to examine the relevant parts of the code that handle the convergence checking and the assignment of cluster_centers_indices_ and labels. The current file context provides the AffinityPropagation class definition and its fit method. The new search results give us more context into the affinity_propagation function, which is called by the fit method.\n\nKey takeaways from the search results include:\n1. The affinity_propagation function handles the core logic of the algorithm, including the iterations, convergence checks, and the assignment of cluster centers and labels.\n2. The function uses a convergence_iter parameter to check for convergence and a max_iter parameter to limit the number of iterations.\n3. If the algorithm does not converge within the max_iter iterations, it sets labels to -1 for each sample and cluster_centers_indices to an empty list, which aligns with the documentation.\n4. However, the user's example shows different behavior, suggesting that there might be a bug or an undocumented edge case that needs investigation.\n\nGiven this information, I will extract relevant code spans from the search results to help identify where the convergence logic might be failing or where the return values are being set incorrectly.",
