The documentation suggests that in such cases, it should return an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as a label for each training sample. However, the observed behavior is different, leading to potential user confusion. To address this, we need to investigate the implementation of AffinityPropagation in the _affinity_propagation.py file to understand how it handles non-convergence and consider if the documentation needs updating. Additionally, looking into the verbose setting and other properties like n_iter_ might also provide insights into the convergence status.",

The user expects an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge, but they are seeing different results. This discrepancy could be due to incorrect handling of convergence status in the algorithm's implementation or return values. To address this, I need to identify the relevant parts of the code where the convergence status is checked and the results are returned. By examining the `affinity_propagation` function and the `AffinityPropagation` class, I can pinpoint where the convergence check and the return values are managed. I will search for the code sections that handle the logic for returning an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for labels when the algorithm fails to converge.

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
