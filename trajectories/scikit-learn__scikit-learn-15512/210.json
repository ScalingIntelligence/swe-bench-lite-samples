The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 as a label for each training sample. However, the user experiences different behavior where cluster centers and labels are assigned despite non-convergence. This discrepancy needs to be investigated.\n\nFrom the search results, it is evident that the current implementation of the AffinityPropagation algorithm checks for convergence through the iteration process and logs convergence status based on the number of iterations. If the algorithm does not converge within the specified number of iterations, it logs 'Did not converge' and proceeds to handle the non-convergence scenario. The handling for non-convergence sets the labels to -1 and cluster_centers_indices to an empty list, which aligns with the documentation. This indicates that the code section responsible for handling non-convergence is already present in the implementation. The issue reported by the user might be caused by a different section of the code that overrides or misinterprets this state, or perhaps the user's environment/setup is affecting the behavior.\n\nBased on the given file context and search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function. The identified spans include the initialization of the AffinityPropagation class, the fit method that triggers the clustering process, and the core logic of the affinity_propagation function, especially the part dealing with the non-convergence handling.",
