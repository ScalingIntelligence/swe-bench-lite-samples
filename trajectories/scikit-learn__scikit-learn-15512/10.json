The analysis of the provided code spans reveals that the algorithm does handle the non-convergence scenario but not in the way the user expects. Specifically, when the algorithm does not converge, it triggers a ConvergenceWarning and sets labels to -1 for each sample and cluster_centers_indices to an empty list.
