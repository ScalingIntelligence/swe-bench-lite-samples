The relevant code span to examine is the one defining the affinity_propagation function, where the logic for determining convergence and handling non-convergence cases resides. The function contains the logic for updating responsibilities and availabilities during iterations, checking for convergence, and setting cluster labels and centers based on the convergence status. By analyzing this code span, we can determine if the documentation is accurate or if the function behaves differently.

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
