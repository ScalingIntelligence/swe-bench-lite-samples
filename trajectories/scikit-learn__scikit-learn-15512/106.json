The provided search results contain the source code for the `AffinityPropagation` class in `_affinity_propagation.py`. This class includes methods such as `fit`, `predict`, and `fit_predict`, which are relevant to the issue. The `fit` method sets up and calls the `affinity_propagation` function, which handles the clustering algorithm. The `predict` method is used to get cluster predictions and handles the case where no cluster centers are found due to non-convergence. This part of the code appears to be the place where handling of non-converged results should occur, ensuring that the return values match the documented behavior.

The expected behavior, according to the documentation, is to return an empty array for cluster center indices and -1 for each label when the algorithm does not converge. However, the example provided shows that this is not the case: instead of returning -1 labels, it returns an incorrect clustering result. The issue seeks to address how to properly detect non-convergence within a larger script. Given the provided file context and search results, the most relevant code spans to address this issue are found within the `AffinityPropagation.fit` method, which handles the clustering results, and within the `affinity_propagation` function, which performs the actual clustering and checks for convergence. Specifically, it is important to identify where the convergence status is determined and how the results are handled in case of non-convergence. The `affinity_propagation` function uses an iteration limit and a convergence criterion to detect whether the algorithm has not converged, and this status should directly influence how the `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` attributes are set in the `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class. The `predict` method also checks if the model has any cluster centers before making predictions, which could be relevant for handling non-convergence scenarios. Overall, the relevant code spans focus on the logic within the `fit` method and the `affinity_propagation` function that deal with setting clustering results based on convergence status.",
