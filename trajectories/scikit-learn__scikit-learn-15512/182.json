The documentation suggests that in such cases, it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label. However, the user observed different behavior where the algorithm still assigns cluster centers and labels, which might be misleading for users. To address this, we need to search for the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function to understand how the algorithm handles non-convergence and whether the documentation aligns with the actual behavior. We should also look for any checks or properties that indicate convergence status explicitly.",

The key methods to investigate are `__init__` and `fit`. The `__init__` method initializes the parameters for affinity propagation, including `max_iter`, which determines the maximum number of iterations. The `fit` method is responsible for performing the clustering. In the `fit` method, the `affinity_propagation` function is called with the parameters set in the `__init__`, and it returns `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_`. The current implementation does not explicitly handle non-convergence by returning an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and -1 for each label as the documentation suggests. This discrepancy between the documentation and the actual behavior could be what the user is experiencing. Since no other code spans mention handling non-convergence explicitly, it appears that the handling of non-convergence might need to be addressed in this class.",

According to the documentation, when the algorithm doesn't converge, it should return an empty array for cluster center indices and -1 for each label. However, the user's test example with a non-converging scenario returns a cluster center and labels instead of the expected results. This discrepancy needs to be addressed.\n\nFrom the current context and the search results, the relevant code spans are located within the 'sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py' file. The code spans include the 'affinity_propagation' function and the 'fit' method of the 'AffinityPropagation' class. These are critical for understanding how the algorithm handles the convergence and what values it returns in different scenarios.\n\nThe 'affinity_propagation' function includes the logic for running the clustering algorithm, checking for convergence, and returning the cluster center indices and labels. The 'fit' method in the 'AffinityPropagation' class calls this function and processes the results. The 'predict' method is also relevant, as it handles the labeling of new samples based on the trained model, which can be affected by the convergence status.\n\nGiven the reported issue, these code spans are relevant for verifying the current behavior and potentially adjusting it to match the documented expectations.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
