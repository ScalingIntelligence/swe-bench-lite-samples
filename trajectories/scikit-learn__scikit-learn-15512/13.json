The provided code from the `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py` file includes the `AffinityPropagation` class definition and its `__init__` and `fit` methods among others.

The documentation states that in such cases, it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices and -1 for each label. However, the user observed different behavior. I analyzed the context and search results to understand where this discrepancy might occur.\n\n1. **Initial Analysis of Context**: The context provided includes the `AffinityPropagation` class and its `fit` method. This method is crucial as it conducts the clustering and sets the `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_`. The `fit` method calls the `affinity_propagation` function, which is a key part to check.\n\n2. **Analysis of New Search Results**: The new search results provided the `affinity_propagation` function. This function handles the clustering process and checks for convergence. Interestingly, in the else block where it determines what to do when the algorithm does not converge, the function correctly assigns -1 to labels and sets cluster_centers_indices to an empty list. This aligns with the documented behavior. The issue might be in how the calling function (`fit`) handles or reports these values when it doesn't converge.\n\n3. **Evaluation**: Based on the analysis, both the context and the new search results indeed indicate that the function should return -1 for labels and an empty list for cluster_centers_indices when not converging. The user's complaint about observing different values might be elsewhere in the code or might require deeper inspection of their execution context or specific data handling. Additionally, to help address the user's issue, it would be useful to add a property or method that explicitly checks if the clustering has converged and can be used to alert users.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Identifying the exact point of discrepancy will require possibly stepping through the user's execution to see why the documented response isn't what's observed in practice. Also, implementing a convergence check method based on the results of `affinity_propagation` inside the `AffinityPropagation` class could be a good enhancement.",
