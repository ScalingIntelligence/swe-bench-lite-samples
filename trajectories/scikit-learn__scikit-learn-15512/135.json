The user expects certain return values, but they observe different results. The user also notes the inconvenience of determining convergence using the verbose option and suggests a more straightforward method to check for convergence. The main concern is ensuring that users can detect when the clustering doesn't converge, possibly through additional properties or changes in return values. The search results include the AffinityPropagation class definition and its fit method implementation. It shows the logic for processing the input data and running the affinity_propagation function, which includes parameters for max_iter and convergence_iter. The fit method sets the cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ attributes based on the result of the affinity_propagation function. These parts of the code are relevant for understanding how convergence and return values are handled but do not show a direct check for non-convergence or the specific returning of -1 labels as mentioned in the documentation. Therefore, it is necessary to check if there's additional logic or documentation specifying returns in case of non-convergence.",

The function internally maintains a convergence status array `e` which tracks the convergence status of each sample over the last `convergence_iter` iterations. When `affinity_propagation` concludes that convergence was not achieved by checking `unconverged`, it will issue a warning about the lack of convergence and set `labels_` to an array of -1. Similarly, `cluster_centers_indices_` is set to an empty list if no clusters are found due to non-convergence. This behavior aligns with the documentation stating the return results upon non-convergence but confirms the implementation directly, addressing possible concerns about discrepancies. Given the extent and specificity of this investigation, I am confident that we've thoroughly inspected the pertinent parts of the code and understand the behavior under non-convergence conditions. Thus, our search can be considered complete.",
