The 'fit' method processes the input data to prepare the affinity matrix, calling the 'affinity_propagation' function to execute the clustering.\n2. The 'predict' method handles prediction, but it checks for non-convergence to return -1 labels. This indicates the potential location to integrate a more explicit check for non-convergence.\n3. The 'fit_predict' method is also available.\n\nGiven the issue, the relevant portions to consider are:\n- The 'fit' method where the clustering process occurs.\n- The 'predict' method, which has logic to deal with non-convergence, suggesting a potential overlook or issue in the core clustering logic in the 'fit' method.\n\nThese spans provide a starting point to inspect and adjust the code to ensure the algorithm behaves as documented during non-convergence scenarios.",
