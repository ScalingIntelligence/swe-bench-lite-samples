The provided context and search results indicate that the current implementation of the AffinityPropagation class in sklearn does not explicitly handle non-convergence by returning -1 for labels or an empty array for cluster centers as the documentation suggests. Instead, it continues to provide cluster center indices and labels even when the algorithm does not converge. This discrepancy between the documentation and implementation is relevant to the issue reported. The search results contain the implementation of the affinity_propagation function which is crucial for understanding how convergence is handled. From this function, it's evident that when the algorithm does not converge, it sets labels to [-1]*n_samples and cluster_centers_indices to an empty list, which aligns with the documented expected behavior. However, the fit method of the AffinityPropagation class does not appear to adapt these outputs to return -1 for labels or an empty list for cluster centers unless the algorithm actually converges. This indicates a potential gap in the implementation to match the documented behavior for non-convergence handling.",
