The reported issue specifically questions the behavior when the algorithm does not converge, as the documentation suggests returning an empty array for 'cluster_centers_indices_' and -1 for each label. The provided code snippet does not directly handle the non-convergence scenario and does not return -1 for labels or an empty array for cluster centers. Instead, it directly assigns the results of the 'affinity_propagation' function to 'self.cluster_centers_indices_' and 'self.labels_'. This suggests that the handling of non-convergence might be taking place within the 'affinity_propagation' function, which is not shown in the provided context. Thus, the 'fit' method in the 'AffinityPropagation' class does not include explicit handling or checks for non-convergence, which is likely to be the source of the issue. To resolve this, one might need to further investigate the 'affinity_propagation' function or consider adding additional checks within the 'fit' method to manage non-convergence appropriately.",

From the provided search results, we can see the main function `affinity_propagation` where the convergence logic is implemented. Notably, when the algorithm does not converge and `K > 0` condition fails, the warnings are triggered, and the labels are set to `-1` for each sample. However, this part of the code seems to conflict with the initial expectation that it might return empty cluster centers and `-1` for each label if the algorithm does not converge. It appears that the documentation could be inaccurate in this regard.\n\nFor a clearer understanding of the intended behavior and potential fixes, it's crucial to examine the function `affinity_propagation` in detail. This function includes the logic for updating responsibilities (`R`) and availabilities (`A`), checking convergence conditions, and setting final labels and cluster centers. The part of the code where it checks for convergence and sets the labels to `-1` when not converged is particularly relevant to the issue.\n\nGiven the request for a more straightforward way to check for convergence (beyond the verbose option), one option could be to use a property like `has_converged` directly in the AffinityPropagation class. To implement this, the fit method in `AffinityPropagation` should set a flag indicating the convergence status based on `n_iter_` and `max_iter` comparisons, which could then be returned or used to set labels accordingly. The relevant code spans to address this issue can be found in the `affinity_propagation` function, specifically where it sets `warnings.warn` and handles `labels` in case of non-convergence.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
