The user expects to receive an empty array for cluster centers and -1 as labels for each sample when the algorithm does not converge, as stated in the documentation, but instead receives [2] as cluster center and [0, 0, 0] as cluster labels. The investigation focuses on two main aspects: identifying the code that handles the convergence check and the code that assigns labels and cluster centers based on the convergence status.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are found primarily in the 'affinity_propagation' function and the 'AffinityPropagation' class. The 'affinity_propagation' function contains the core logic of the algorithm, including the conditions for convergence and the handling of cluster centers and labels upon convergence or lack thereof. The 'AffinityPropagation' class encapsulates the algorithm, initializing parameters and executing the fitting process. The specific methods 'fit' and 'predict' are particularly important as they deal directly with fitting the model to the data and predicting cluster labels.\n\nThe identified code spans provide a complete picture from the initialization of parameters to the execution of the algorithm and the handling of results. The interested spans include 'affinity_propagation' for the main logic, 'AffinityPropagation' for class definition, 'AffinityPropagation.__init__' for parameter initialization, 'AffinityPropagation.fit' for fitting the model, and 'AffinityPropagation.predict' for predicting cluster assignments. The 'affinity_propagation' span also covers the part where the algorithm checks for convergence and assigns labels and cluster centers accordingly. The 'AffinityPropagation.fit' span is particularly crucial as it executes the 'affinity_propagation' function and stores the results in the instance attributes 'cluster_centers_indices_', 'labels_', and 'n_iter_'.",
