The user also mentions the documentation stating that the algorithm returns an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for labels in case of non-convergence.\n\nTo address this issue, the relevant code spans should focus on where the algorithm checks for convergence, modifies the labels based on convergence status, and returns the results. From the search results, the most relevant code spans are located within the `affinity_propagation` function and the `AffinityPropagation` class methods.\n\nIn the `affinity_propagation` function, the part where the algorithm checks for unconverged status and sets the labels to -1 is crucial.

The `AffinityPropagation` class's `fit` method uses this function to determine the cluster centers and labels, which suggest that the issue could be in how non-convergence is communicated and handled in the return values of the `affinity_propagation` function.

Specifically, the issue notes that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for labels, but instead, it returns unexpected values. The current file context and search results show the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and its fit method. The relevant code spans include the affinity_propagation function, which handles the clustering logic, and the section where the algorithm determines whether it has converged. This section includes the handling of the 'verbose' parameter and the assignment of labels and cluster centers. Given the issue's focus on non-convergence behavior, the relevant spans are where the algorithm checks for convergence and assigns labels in the case of non-convergence.",

The `affinity_propagation` function sets up the algorithm parameters, computes the affinity matrix, and iteratively updates the responsibility and availability matrices until convergence or max iterations are reached. During non-convergence, the function triggers a ConvergenceWarning and sets the labels to -1 for each sample, but it doesn't explicitly mention or initialize `cluster_centers_indices_` to an empty array in the same case, which could explain the discrepancy observed. The `AffinityPropagation` class's `fit` method uses this function to determine the cluster centers and labels, which suggest that the issue could be in how non-convergence is communicated and handled in the return values of the `affinity_propagation` function. A detailed review of the non-convergence handling logic is necessary to align the documentation with the actual implemented behavior, focusing specifically on the assignment and initialization of `cluster_centers_indices_` when non-convergence occurs.",
