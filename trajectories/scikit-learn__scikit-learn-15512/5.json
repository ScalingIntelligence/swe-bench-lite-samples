The documentation states that in such cases, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for each sample label. However, the user experiences different behavior where they receive [2] as the cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. The analysis of the search results from 'sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py' provides valuable insights into how the Affinity Propagation algorithm is implemented and how it handles convergence and non-convergence. The 'affinity_propagation' function includes logic to determine convergence and set labels and cluster center indices accordingly. If the algorithm does not converge within the specified number of iterations, it sets 'labels' to [-1] * n_samples and 'cluster_center_indices' to an empty list, which aligns with the documented behavior. This suggests that the user's issue may stem from the implementation details of the fit method, possibly not correctly reflecting the convergence status. The identified code spans are relevant as they provide the core implementation of the Affinity Propagation and how it manages the non-convergence scenario.",
