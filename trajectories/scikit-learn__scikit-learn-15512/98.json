According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_centers_indices and -1 for each sample in labels. However, the user's experience shows a different outcome where the clustering results appear as if it has converged. The user is seeking a way to detect non-convergence more reliably without relying on the verbose option. Identifying the relevant parts of the code that deal with the convergence status and the return values of cluster_centers_indices and labels is crucial to understand if the documentation needs updating or if there's a bug.
