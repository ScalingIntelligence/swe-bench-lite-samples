The documentation states that an empty array should be returned for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label in such cases. However, the provided example does not show this behavior, leading to confusion about the correct handling of non-convergence.\n\nExamination of the search results reveals several important methods and properties in the AffinityPropagation class. Notably, the fit method is where the clustering operation is performed, and it sets the cluster_centers_indices_, labels_, and n_iter_ attributes. The predict method also handles the scenario where the model does not have any cluster centers, labeling every sample as '-1'. \n\nGiven the issue, focusing on the fit method and the predict method would be crucial to ensure proper handling of non-converging scenarios. The fit method's handling of the affinity matrix and the subsequent declaration of cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_ are particularly important for implementing correct behavior when convergence doesn't occur.",
