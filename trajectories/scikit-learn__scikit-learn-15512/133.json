The documentation suggests that non-convergence should result in an empty array for cluster_centers_indices_ and -1 for each label in labels_. However, the observed behavior is inconsistent with the documentation. This discrepancy needs to be investigated in the source code to understand how non-convergence is handled and how the returned values are determined. To address this, I will start by identifying the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and how it processes the convergence status and returns labels and cluster centers. To narrow down the search further, I will also look for checks related to convergence status within the AffinityPropagation class.",

According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each sample in labels_. However, the user observed different behavior in their example. The provided search results contain the source code for the AffinityPropagation class in scikit-learn, which includes the fit method and predict method. These methods handle the clustering process and the prediction, respectively. The fit method calls the affinity_propagation function, which is crucial for understanding how the algorithm processes and decides on the cluster centers and labels. The predict method checks if there are any cluster centers; if not, it returns -1 for each sample, which aligns with the documented behavior for non-convergence. However, the user's example indicates that this documented behavior might not always be followed. Reviewing the code, there doesn't appear to be an explicit check within the fit method to ensure that the labels are set to -1 in the event of non-convergence other than the warning in the predict method. This suggests that the fit method might indeed not be fully compliant with the documented behavior. Identifying and understanding this discrepancy is crucial for determining if the documentation is wrong, or if there is a need to correct the code to ensure the documented behavior.",

The primary concern is the handling of scenarios where the algorithm does not converge, specifically how it returns the cluster center indices and labels. The documentation states that the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster center indices and -1 for each label in case of non-convergence. However, the user observed different results and suspects a discrepancy or error in documentation or implementation.\n\nThe key code spans to focus on are those related to the `fit` method within the `AffinityPropagation` class and the `affinity_propagation` function. The `fit` method calls the `affinity_propagation` function, which is responsible for the actual clustering algorithm. Inside the `affinity_propagation` function, I identified the logic that determines whether the algorithm has converged or not. Specifically, the section where the iterations are performed and the checks for convergence or non-convergence are important. The non-convergence condition is recognized when the algorithm fails to converge within the specified number of iterations, and in such cases, it sets the labels to -1 and returns an empty array for cluster centers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans thoroughly handle the non-convergence scenario as described in the documentation. Thus, I conclude that the provided search results are relevant to the reported issue.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
