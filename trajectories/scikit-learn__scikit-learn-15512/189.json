However, the user is experiencing different behavior. The provided search results include the implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and its methods such as __init__, fit, and predict. These methods are relevant because they deal with the core functionality of the algorithm: initializing parameters, fitting the model to data, and predicting cluster labels. Notably, the fit method is crucial as it calculates the cluster centers and labels, which directly relate to the user's concern about the algorithm's convergence. Additionally, the predict method checks if the model has cluster centers and returns -1 labels if there are none, which aligns with the issue reported.

The user expects that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return empty cluster centers and -1 labels for all samples. However, in the provided example, non-convergence results in specific cluster centers and identical labels for all samples instead of -1. The user is seeking a way to reliably check convergence without relying on the verbose option or comparing max_iter with n_iter_.\n\nReviewing the provided file context and search results, we find relevant sections in the sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py file. Specifically, the AffinityPropagation class's fit method processes the input data and determines cluster centers and labels, utilizing the affinity_propagation function. The fit method does not explicitly check for convergence and handles affinity computation and clustering differently based on whether the affinity is precomputed or based on Euclidean distances.\n\nThe affinity_propagation function, as detailed in the search results, iteratively computes responsibilities and availabilities until convergence or the maximum number of iterations is reached. It handles non-convergence by issuing a ConvergenceWarning and setting labels to -1 for all samples if no clusters are formed. This behavior aligns with the user's expectation for handling non-convergence, but the example demonstrates a different outcome.\n\nGiven the structure and logic of the code, it appears that the handling of non-convergence could be problematic in specific scenarios, particularly the case mentioned where [0,0,0] labels are returned instead of [-1,-1,-1]. The relevant spans of code are those dealing with the computation of cluster centers, labels, and the handling of non-convergence conditions. Specifically, the spans include the fit method within the AffinityPropagation class and the affinity_propagation function which manages the iteration and convergence checks.\n\nOverall, the provided search results do not directly address the specific issue of why the clustering is returning [0,0,0] labels instead of [-1,-1,-1] on non-convergence. Additional investigation may be required to pinpoint the exact code block responsible for this behavior.",

When the algorithm does not converge, as indicated by not achieving convergence within the maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`), it sets all labels to -1 and the `cluster_centers_indices_` to an empty list, conforming to the documented behavior. This logic is present in the code, which also issues a `ConvergenceWarning` in such cases. Thus, the documentation correctly describes the behavior for non-convergence. However, the user's observed outcomes might be due to misunderstandings or specific edge cases not covered by this default response. The implementation seems robust for handling non-convergence situations.",
