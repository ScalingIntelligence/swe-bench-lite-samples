The key focus is on understanding how the algorithm handles non-convergence and the values it returns in such cases. The current implementation of `affinity_propagation` does not explicitly handle non-convergence by returning an empty array for cluster centers and -1 for labels, as described in the documentation. Instead, it raises a `ConvergenceWarning` and assigns labels as -1 for all samples if no clusters are found, which does not fully align with the documented behavior. Additionally, the `AffinityPropagation` class in the `fit` method assigns cluster centers and labels based on the results of the `affinity_propagation` function call, without additional checks for convergence status beyond the number of iterations. This indicates a potential discrepancy between the documented behavior and the actual implementation. To resolve this, one might consider adding a check within the `AffinityPropagation` class to verify convergence and adjust the returned values accordingly, ensuring they match the documented behavior for non-convergence.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
