According to the documentation, when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label in labels_. However, the user experiences different behavior: the clustering returns a cluster center and labels that suggest convergence despite not actually converging. The primary relevance of the search results lies in the actual implementation of the AffinityPropagation class and its methods related to fitting and predicting cluster data, particularly concerning the handling of non-convergence situations. The fit method is of particular interest as it sets up the algorithm's parameters, runs the clustering process, and assigns the results to cluster_centers_indices_ and labels_. The predict method is also relevant because it deals with how new data points are assigned a cluster in the context of existing cluster centers -- it suggests actions that handle cases where no clusters are identified, which may relate to non-convergence. There doesn't appear to be explicit handling of non-convergence within the fit method other than through assignment of results from affinity_propagation, and in the predict method, handling is done conditionally based on the presence of cluster centers. This analysis indicates that possibly the documentation is misaligned with the implementation or that the implementation may not be fully addressing the non-convergence scenario as described in the documentation. The identified code spans focus on the methods where this behavior might be either correctly implemented or where adjustments are necessary to meet the expected behavior documented for non-convergence.",

However, the user observed different behavior in their test case. To address this issue, we need to look at the code related to the convergence check and the return values in the case of non-convergence.\n\nIn the provided file context, the `AffinityPropagation` class has a `fit` method that calls the `affinity_propagation` function. The `predict` method also deals with the case where no cluster centers are present due to non-convergence.\n\nIn the search results, the `affinity_propagation` function handles the logic for checking convergence and determining the return values for cluster centers and labels. The function raises a `ConvergenceWarning` if the algorithm does not converge and sets labels to -1 for each sample. This behavior aligns with the documentation and should address the user's concern.

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
