The issue describes an expectation mismatch where the algorithm does not return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for labels when it fails to converge, which contradicts the documentation. The relevant code spans should include the initialization, fitting, and prediction methods of the AffinityPropagation class, especially where the convergence status is checked or handled. Additionally, any utility functions or internal methods that deal with clustering behavior upon non-convergence should be considered. The provided search results include several key spans - the initialization of AffinityPropagation, the fit method which performs the actual clustering, and the predict method which handles predictions based on the clustering outcome. The affinity_propagation function that performs the main clustering logic is particularly important, as it includes checks for equal similarities and preferences, which might affect convergence. The ConvergenceWarning handling in the predict method is also relevant, as it relates to the non-convergence scenario described in the issue.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
