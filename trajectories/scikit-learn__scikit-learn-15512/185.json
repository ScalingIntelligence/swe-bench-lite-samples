The user expects an empty array for cluster center indices and -1 labels for non-converged cases but observes different results. They also suggest a method to check for convergence state within a larger script. \n\nI reviewed the provided code snippets from the 'sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py' file. The function 'affinity_propagation()' and class 'AffinityPropagation()' caught my attention as these directly handle the clustering and convergence aspects. \n\nIn the 'affinity_propagation()' function, I noted the handling for convergence and non-convergence scenarios. On convergence failure, it updates 'labels' with -1 and returns an empty 'cluster_centers_indices' array. However, I noticed that the actual behavior might not align with the expected return values as described by the user. \n\nConsidering the class 'AffinityPropagation()' under 'sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py', it encapsulates the fitting and prediction logic using the utility methods and initiates the 'affinity_propagation()' function during the fit process. I primarily targeted the 'fit()' method to review how the algorithm is invoked and how its output involving 'cluster_centers_indices' and 'labels' is managed. It connects closely to the user's concern for checking non-convergence from either the model attributes or a more direct property. \n\nIn conclusion, I deduced that adequate code spans for correcting the discrepancy would be within the 'affinity_propagation()' function and the 'fit()' method of the 'AffinityPropagation' class, specifically towards understanding and handling cases when the algorithm does not converge.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
