According to the documentation, the expected output is an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and `-1` for each label in `labels_` when convergence fails. However, the observed behavior differs, which could either be a bug or an inconsistency in the documentation. The focus should be on the AffinityPropagation class and its methods, particularly the `fit` method, which is responsible for executing the clustering algorithm. Additionally, the `_affinity_propagation.py` module is of high relevance as it contains the underlying logic for the affinity propagation algorithm. To resolve this, we should search for the exact implementation of the behavior when the algorithm does not converge and compare it with the documented expected behavior.",
