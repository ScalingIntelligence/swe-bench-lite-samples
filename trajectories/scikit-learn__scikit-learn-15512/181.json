To investigate this, we need to focus on the AffinityPropagation class and its fit method, specifically looking for where the cluster_center_indices and labels are assigned when the algorithm does not converge.

According to the documentation, in case of non-convergence, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster_center_indices_ and -1 for each label. However, the user experiences different behavior, where the algorithm returns [2] as the cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels, indicating that the clustering has somehow been performed. The user is looking for a way to detect non-convergence without relying on verbose output, suggesting a potential property or check in the code. Reviewing the provided code spans, the relevant sections are those that handle the convergence logic and the return values of the clustering results. Specifically, the 'affinity_propagation' function in the search results contains the logic for determining convergence and assigning cluster labels. The function iterates up to 'max_iter' to determine if the algorithm converges. If it does not converge within this limit and 'convergence_iter' conditions are not met, it should ideally set the labels to -1 and return an empty list for cluster centers. The current implementation, however, seems to handle non-convergence by setting 'labels' to [\u22121] * n_samples and 'cluster_centers_indices' to an empty list. This aligns with the documentation's description of the expected behavior when non-convergence occurs. Therefore, the analysis confirms that the code does implement the documented return values for non-convergence, but it also highlights that users might need additional checks to distinguish different non-convergent scenarios better.",

  "initial_message": "Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering\nThe affinity propagation Documentation states: \r\n\"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample.\"\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])\r\naf = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)\r\n\r\nprint(af.cluster_centers_indices_)\r\nprint(af.labels_)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. \r\nThe only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
