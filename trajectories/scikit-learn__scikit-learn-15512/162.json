The key aspects to consider are how the algorithm handles convergence and what values it returns in case of non-convergence. \n\n1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**: This method initializes the parameters of the AffinityPropagation object, including `max_iter` and `convergence_iter`, which are crucial for understanding the convergence behavior. \n\n2. **Fitting (`fit` method)**: This method is where the main clustering process takes place. It uses the `affinity_propagation` function internally and sets the `cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`, and `n_iter_` attributes based on the outcome of the clustering process. This is where we should look to understand how the algorithm determines convergence and what it does when it does not converge. \n\n3. **Prediction (`predict` method)**: This method handles prediction for new data points. It also includes a check for the existence of cluster centers, which might not be present if the algorithm did not converge, leading to a warning and the return of -1 labels. This part of the code aligns with the user's expectation regarding the handling of non-convergent cases. \n\nBased on the analysis, the following spans of code are relevant: `AffinityPropagation.__init__`, `AffinityPropagation.fit`, and `AffinityPropagation.predict`.\n\nThese sections directly address the initialization of parameters, the core clustering process, and the subsequent handling of non-convergent cases. I did not include the `_pairwise` property or `fit_predict` method in the identified spans because they are less directly related to the issue of convergence handling.",

The issue pertains to the handling of non-converging cases, where the expectation is to receive an empty array for cluster centers and `-1` labels for all samples. However, the observed behavior is different, potentially indicating a bug or a need for documentation clarification. The analysis involves examining the `AffinityPropagation` class and the `affinity_propagation` function to understand how non-convergence is handled. Specifically, the `fit` method in `AffinityPropagation` calls the `affinity_propagation` function, which determines the cluster centers and labels and checks for convergence. The function sets labels to `-1` when no clusters are found, which aligns with the issue's expectation but seems to be missing in the actual implementation observed. Further, the `predict` method also checks for the presence of cluster centers and assigns `-1` labels if none are found, indicating the algorithm has not converged. This behavior supports the expectation but is not executed as expected in the observed case. Therefore, the relevant code spans identified relate to the handling of non-converging cases and the assignment of labels in the `affinity_propagation` function and the `predict` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class, potentially indicating a need for adjustments to ensure the documented behavior is upheld.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
