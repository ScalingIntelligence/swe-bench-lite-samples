The user expects the algorithm to return specific values when convergence fails, but the observed behavior does not match the expected results according to the documentation. The user is looking for a more reliable way to detect non-convergence without relying on verbose output or checking the iteration count. \n\nIn the `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py` file, I found the definition of the `AffinityPropagation` class along with its methods. The `fit` method is responsible for running the Affinity Propagation algorithm and setting the `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` attributes based on the convergence status. The `predict` method is also relevant because it handles the labeling of new data points. It includes a check for the presence of cluster centers, and if none are found, it issues a warning and returns labels of -1 for all samples, which aligns with the expected behavior in case of non-convergence.\n\nGiven the issue, the most relevant parts of the code to focus on are those that handle the convergence status and set the return values for `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_`. Specifically, I would look at the `fit` method and the `predict` method, particularly where these attributes are set and checked. The spans of code that are most relevant are those that define the behavior when the algorithm does not converge and how the labels are calculated and returned.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
