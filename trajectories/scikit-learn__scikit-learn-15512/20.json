The user expects to receive -1 labels for each sample when the algorithm does not converge, but instead observes different behavior. This discrepancy seems to be related to the implementation of the convergence check within the `affinity_propagation` function. The provided code spans and search results show how the `affinity_propagation` function is defined and how it handles the convergence. The issue might be related to the conditions under which the algorithm decides it has not converged and the actions taken (or not taken) based on that decision. Specifically, the code indicates that if the algorithm does not converge, it sets all labels to -1 and returns an empty list for `cluster_centers_indices`. However, the observed behavior suggests there might be a bug or a misinterpretation of the documented behavior. For a more precise assessment, one would need to trace the execution through each iteration and check the conditions determining convergence.\n\nFrom the search results, it appears that the relevant code spans are those within the `affinity_propagation` function where the algorithm checks for convergence and handles the cases of no convergence. Also, the initial context provided includes the `AffinityPropagation` class definition and its `fit` method, which calls the `affinity_propagation` function. These are essential for understanding how the algorithm behaves when it fails to converge.\n\nThe identified code spans are:\n1. The `affinity_propagation` function, which includes the logic for convergence checking and handling non-convergence cases.\n2. The `AffinityPropagation` class and its `fit` method, which are crucial for initiating the clustering process and handling the results.\n\nFrom this analysis, the search task can be considered complete as the relevant code spans that address the reported issue have been identified.",

A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).\r\nI am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?\r\n\r\nFor my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Nov 21 2018, 02:32:25)  [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-15)]\r\nexecutable: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/bin/python\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-52-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\r\n  lib_dirs: /home/jenniferh/Programs/anaconda3/envs/TF_RDKit_1_19/lib\r\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\r\nPython deps:\r\n    pip: 18.1\r\n   setuptools: 40.6.3\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.3\r\n   numpy: 1.15.4\r\n   scipy: 1.2.0\r\n   Cython: 0.29.2\r\n   pandas: 0.23.4\r\n\r\n\n"
