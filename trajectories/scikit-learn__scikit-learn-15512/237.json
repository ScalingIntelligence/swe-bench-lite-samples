By examining the 'fit' method, it's clear that the algorithm does not currently handle non-convergence by setting labels to -1 as described in the documentation. Instead, it continues with a partial result, which could be misleading. Additionally, the 'predict' method attempts to handle cases where no clusters are identified, but this is after the fact and does not integrate smoothly with the main fit method's logic regarding convergence. These sections of the code are crucial for addressing the reported issue and ensuring that a non-converged state is appropriately flagged without relying on verbose output or hacky post-fit checks.",

The existing code provides a foundation in the 'affinity_propagation' function for determining convergence and setting labels and cluster centers accordingly. Specifically, it checks for convergence using the 'e' array and 'convergence_iter' parameter. If the algorithm does not converge within the specified number of iterations, it sets the labels to -1 and returns an empty list for cluster centers. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the reported behavior where non-convergence might not yield the documented results. Therefore, it is important to trace the exact points in the code where these checks and assignments occur, which will help in either confirming the current behavior or identifying potential issues that need fixing. Based on the provided context and search results, the relevant files and spans directly related to this issue are primarily in 'sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py'.
