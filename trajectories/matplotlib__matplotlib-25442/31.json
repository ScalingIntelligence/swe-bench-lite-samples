The file context also shows how the 'canvas' attribute is indirectly accessed through event handling, as 'self' in these methods is an instance of 'FigureCanvasQT', which inherits from 'FigureCanvasBase'. This indicates that mplcursors likely interacts with 'FigureCanvasQT' by binding to these events, potentially leading to the AttributeError if there's a mismatch between expected and actual canvas states.

The traceback indicates it occurs in the `_check_still_parented` method, which implies the problem could be related to how the event handling or object references are managed. The provided file context and search results focus on the FigureCanvasQT class from the backend_qt module, which is responsible for handling UI events and rendering the figure canvas. Relevant spans include initialization, mouse events, and key events, as these likely interact with the canvas object or its properties. Notably, the `mouseEventCoords` method calculates mouse positions relative to the canvas, which could be a critical part of the error if the canvas reference becomes None. The identified spans from the search results include methods for handling mouse events (press, release, double-click, move) and key events, as well as methods for calculating mouse coordinates and drawing on the canvas. These are all relevant as they interact directly with the canvas object or its properties, which are central to the reported error.",
