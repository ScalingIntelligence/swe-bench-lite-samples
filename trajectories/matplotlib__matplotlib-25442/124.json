The error occurs in the offsetbox module within matplotlib. Given the description and the provided traceback, it's clear that the issue is likely due to changes in how the canvas or event handling is managed in matplotlib 3.7.1. Searching for specific occurrences of code segments related to canvas management and event handling in the relevant backend files could identify where the NoneType is being mishandled.\n\nTwo specific search criteria are useful: searching for the exact error message within the issue to find the immediate source and searching for functions or classes related to canvas or event handling in the backend files to understand the context in which the NoneType is occurring. This could involve functions like set_cursor, mousePressEvent, mouseMoveEvent, or equivalent across different backend files as these are directly related to interaction and canvas handling.",

Analysis of the search results reveals several potential areas of interest:\n\n1. `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py` contains the class `FigureCanvasAgg`, which includes the method `draw()` likely related to rendering and updating the canvas. This is a critical part as the error might stem from an issue during the canvas update or interaction with the mplcursor.\n\n2. The `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_tkagg.py` file includes the `FigureCanvasTkAgg` class, which inherits from `FigureCanvasAgg` and `FigureCanvasTk`. The `draw()` and `blit()` methods here are also related to canvas rendering and could similarly be involved in the error.\n\n3. In `lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py`, the `FigureCanvasBase` class initializes the canvas and handles various events, including those that might be triggered by mplcursor during data selection. This class could be where the canvas attribute is being accessed and might be where the NoneType error originates.\n\nGiven these findings, it's plausible that the code spans from these files and classes could contain the source of the error, particularly where the canvas is being manipulated or accessed during the interaction between matplotlib and mplcursor.",

The search should focus on the areas within the backend files that manage canvas interactions, such as setting and handling cursor events, mouse events, and perhaps more critically, how the canvas attribute itself is being accessed or manipulated. The provided context suggests that the backend_agg.py and backend_bases.py files are particularly relevant, as they deal with the rendering and base management of the figure canvas respectively. Specifically, in backend_agg.py, methods like 'draw', 'print_raw', and 'print_to_buffer' might provide insight into how the canvas is being processed and could potentially house the error spot due to NoneType handling. Meanwhile, in backend_bases.py, the FigureCanvasBase class and its event handling methods are likely candidates for the origin of the NoneType error as they handle abstract canvas events across different backend implementations. This search strategy will predominantly focus on detecting scenarios, either in the form of specific code segments or general functionalities, where a NoneType is expected and handled safely, or where such handling might be inadequate, triggering the described error. Particularly, look for places where 'canvas' or similar attributes are dereferenced without a prior check for None.",

Furthermore, the FigureCanvasBase class initializes the canvas, setting up attributes like `self.figure`, which is crucial for referencing the figure's canvas during operations. Given that the error message mentioned 'canvas' being referenced before assignment or as None, it's crucial to focus on areas where `self.figure.canvas` or simply `canvas` is utilized without a prior check.

This error occurs in the `offsetbox.py` file, specifically in the `DraggableBase` class methods such as `on_release` and `_check_still_parented`. The issue seems to be related to the reference to `self.canvas`, which becomes `None` under certain conditions. Existing file context includes relevant classes and methods from `backend_bases.py`, `backend_agg.py`, and `backend_tkagg.py`, which handle canvas and event management in different backend environments. The new search results include additional relevant classes and methods, most notably `DraggableBase` in `offsetbox.py`, which directly relates to the reported error. This class and its methods (`on_release`, `_check_still_parented`, and `disconnect`) seem to be the primary points of interest for addressing the issue. Other classes such as `ToolSetCursor` in `backend_tools.py` and `Cursor` in `widgets.py` also relate to cursor management and could indirectly impact the issue.",
