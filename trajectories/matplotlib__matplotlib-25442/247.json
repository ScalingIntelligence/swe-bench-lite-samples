This could be related to the interaction between mplcursor and the backend of matplotlib. The provided stack trace suggests the error occurs in the 'offsetbox.py' module. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the 'OffsetBox' class and its methods related to canvas and disconnection to understand how the interaction is handled. Additionally, examining the backend modules (QtAgg, GTK, etc.) to understand how the cursor and canvas interactions are managed under different backends could provide further insights. Focus should also be given to the 'mousePressEvent' and 'mouseMoveEvent' handlers as they are critical functions where the issue might manifest. After identifying the relevant files and code snippets related to canvas and cursor interactions, further debugging and possible changes can be made to resolve the issue.",
