The error primarily occurs during data selection interactions when using matplotlib 3.7.1 in conjunction with mplcursor. Examining the search results, several key areas are relevant for addressing this issue.\n\n1. **lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py**: This file contains the implementation of FigureCanvasAgg which involves rendering and drawing functionalities. Both the 'draw' and 'print_png' methods could be involved in the error\u2019s manifestation.\n\n2. **lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py**: Here, FigureCanvasBase is defined with its __init__ method setting up the canvas and its connections with the figure. This setup might be where the issue originates from, especially checking the connections made to the canvas.\n\n3. **lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_webagg.py**: While primarily about a different backend, FigureCanvasWebAgg is similar to FigureCanvasAgg in that it handles rendering, albeit for a web-based platform. Understanding how it handles 'canvas' interactions can provide insights.\n\n4. **lib/matplotlib/__init__.py**: This provides a range of utility functions and configurations like 'is_interactive' possibly related to how certain attributes like 'canvas' are managed across various modes of interaction.\n\n5. **lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_tkagg.py**: This involves a different backend targeting TkInter, but the FigureCanvasTkAgg class shares some similarities with FigureCanvasAgg in managing the canvas and its drawing functions.\n\nConsidering the error relates to 'NoneType' object not having an attribute 'canvas', focusing on how 'canvas' is initiated, managed, and interacted with in these relevant spans of code would be crucial for fixing the reported issue.",

While the file context does provide some relevant code, such as the FigureCanvasAgg class which might be related to the canvas in question, it does not directly point to the specific problem with mplcursor. There is no direct mention of mplcursor in the provided files, nor is there specific handling of the 'NoneType' object's 'canvas' attribute error. This suggests that further investigation into the interaction between mplcursor and the matplotlib backend might be needed to fully resolve the issue.

Henceforth, selecting a new data point will trigger the same traceback. Otherwise, it works fine. \r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport mplcursors as mpl\r\n\r\nx = np.arange(1, 11)    \r\ny1 = x\r\n\r\nplt.scatter(x,y1)\r\n\r\nmpl.cursor()\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\cbook\\__init__.py\", line 304, in process\r\n    func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1550, in on_release\r\n    if self._check_still_parented() and self.got_artist:\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1560, in _check_still_parented\r\n    self.disconnect()\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1568, in disconnect\r\n    self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1517, in <lambda>\r\n    canvas = property(lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas)\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nNo terminal output\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nUsing matplotlib 3.7.0 or lower works fine.
