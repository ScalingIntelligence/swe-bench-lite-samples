This issue is present in the `_estimate_mi` function as identified in the search results. The function correctly checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto' and then determines the mask for discrete and continuous features. However, the handling of `discrete_features` when it is not 'auto' is done correctly by converting it to an array and then to a boolean mask. This part of the code seems robust. The broader concern, regarding whether the function is tested with `discrete_features != 'auto'`, cannot be addressed with the provided search results alone, as they do not show test cases. However, for the immediate issue, the relevant part is the logic within `_estimate_mi` that handles the `discrete_features` parameter.
