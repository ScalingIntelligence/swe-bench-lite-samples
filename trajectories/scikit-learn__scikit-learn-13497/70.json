This comparison could lead to errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, the issue points out that the function might not be tested for `discrete_features != 'auto'. It is important to identify how `discrete_features` is set and used, both in the `_estimate_mi` function and any related functions like `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`.

This should prevent future numpy errors. Also, the function is used in both `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`, which suggests that it's likely tested for different types of `discrete_features`. However, to ensure comprehensive testing, additional test cases for `discrete_features != 'auto'` specifically should be implemented.
