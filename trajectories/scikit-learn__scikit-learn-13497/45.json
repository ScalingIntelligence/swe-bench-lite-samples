This check is problematic because `discrete_features` can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which would cause errors in future versions of numpy. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that the function `_estimate_mi` indeed includes the problematic line `discrete_features == 'auto'` and also contains the logic to handle `discrete_features` when it is a boolean or an array of indices. This makes the `_estimate_mi` span relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the functions `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` are relevant because they both call `_estimate_mi` with the `discrete_features` parameter, which is central to the issue.
