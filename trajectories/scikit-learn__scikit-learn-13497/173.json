This code span is directly relevant to the issue because it deals with the handling and type checking of 'discrete_features'.

This will cause errors in future versions of numpy, and additionally, it seems the function is never tested with discrete features not equal to 'auto'. To address this, we need to identify the code span that deals with the discrete_features parameter to understand how it's being used and potentially how it could be modified to accommodate different types of input. The provided file context and search results show the _estimate_mi function which is the main focus of the issue. It contains the relevant logic for handling the discrete_features parameter. Additionally, the search results include the mutual_info_regression and mutual_info_classif functions which call _estimate_mi. It would be useful to examine these as well to understand how they interact with and could potentially influence discrete_features. Looking at the provided code spans, the 'discrete_features' parameter handling is found within the '_estimate_mi' span. This span includes the logic for checking the type and setting up the 'discrete_mask', and should be the primary focus for modifying the handling of discrete_features. Since the relevant code for handling 'discrete_features' is fully contained within the provided search results and file context, the task seems complete against the reported issue.",
