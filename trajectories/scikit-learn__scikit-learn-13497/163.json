This can cause errors in future versions of numpy. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` file. The `_estimate_mi` function's handling of `discrete_features` is the key focus. The function checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto' and accordingly sets a boolean value. It then processes `discrete_features` based on whether they are boolean or not, and creates a mask for continuous and discrete features. This part of the code is relevant to the issue as it directly addresses the handling of `discrete_features`. Additionally, since the issue mentions that this function might not be tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto', the surrounding code (including the `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` functions) is also relevant to ensure the function's complete functionality is understood.",
