The issue points out that comparing 'discrete_features' to 'auto' can lead to errors in future versions of numpy, as 'discrete_features' can be an array. The relevant code spans that address this part of the issue are those handling the 'discrete_features' parameter inside the '_estimate_mi' function. Additionally, the context of the issue suggests that the function's behavior with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto' might not be tested, which could be a separate concern but isn't directly relevant to the part about the numpy comparison.
