Additionally, the issue mentions that the function might not be tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, the `_estimate_mi` function is indeed the key function to address the issue. The function contains the logic where `discrete_features` is handled. It first checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto' and then processes it based on whether it's a boolean or not. This is where the problem lies, as the handling doesn't account for `discrete_features` being an array of indices or a boolean mask.
