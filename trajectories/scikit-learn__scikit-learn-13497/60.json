This suggests that we should check for any tests or further usage of _estimate_mi with discrete_features set to values other than 'auto'. We can start by focusing our search on mutual_info_.py to identify all uses of _estimate_mi and how discrete_features are handled.

Specifically, the line `discrete_features == 'auto'` is problematic because `discrete_features` can be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which will cause errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, the issue mentions that we never test this function with `discrete_features != 'auto'. The search results include the `_estimate_mi` function, which is the primary focus of the issue. Analyzing this function, I can see where the error might occur if `discrete_features` is an array because the current code does not handle arrays in the comparison. The other functions (`mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`) both call `_estimate_mi`, but their relevance is secondary as the main issue is in `_estimate_mi` itself. The other files and functions provided in the search results do not directly relate to the issue, so they are not relevant for this task.

The search primarily focused on finding tests where `discrete_features` might be set differently from 'auto' within `estimator_checks.py`. However, the results did not yield specific tests for the `_estimate_mi` function under these conditions. Given this, it is suggested to broaden the search to other relevant files that might test or use the `_estimate_mi` function, especially where `discrete_features` is explicitly set to values other than 'auto'. This will help in identifying missing test coverage and ensure that the function correctly handles these cases. The file `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` already provides the implementation of `_estimate_mi` and shows how `discrete_features` is processed and could error in future versions of numpy if not handled properly. This underscores the need for a focused search on relevant testing parts of the codebase.",
