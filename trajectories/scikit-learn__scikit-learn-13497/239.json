Specifically, the code currently checks if `discrete_features == 'auto'`, but `discrete_features` can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which can cause errors in future versions of numpy. The analysis needs to focus on identifying the relevant sections of code that deal with the handling of `discrete_features`. From the current context, the relevant file is already identified as `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` with the `_estimate_mi` function checked. The search results include additional files like `sklearn/feature_selection/univariate_selection.py` and `sklearn/feature_selection/rfe.py`, which need to be assessed for relevance. The main focus should be on `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` to ensure all parts of the `_estimate_mi` function are considered. Additionally, the `_compute_mi` function in the same file should be checked for any dependencies or interactions with `discrete_features`. The search results also include other files which may not directly relate to the issue but could be potential places where similar issues might arise, hence need a thorough review. After analyzing the provided code spans, it appears that the file `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` and its functions `_estimate_mi` and `_compute_mi` are most relevant to the reported issue. The relevant code spans in these functions handle the logic for discrete features, and modifications here would directly address the problem of comparing a string to an array.",

This function should handle cases where 'discrete_features' can be an array of indices or a boolean mask, but the current implementation might cause errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, the issue mentions the need to test the function with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto'.\n\nThe search results show several spans of code across different files, but the primary focus should be on `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` where the `_estimate_mi` function is located. The relevant spans in this file deal with the handling of 'discrete_features'. Specifically, the block where 'discrete_features' is checked against 'auto' and then processed based on whether it's boolean or an array of indices.\n\nFrom a review of these spans:\n- The check 'if discrete_features == 'auto'' and the subsequent handling of the 'discrete_features' are identified as critical parts of the code that need attention.\n- The code then checks if 'discrete_features' is a boolean or an array and processes it accordingly, but this logic needs to be robust to handle any input effectively to avoid future numpy errors.\n\nIt seems appropriate to start by addressing the immediate concerns in the `_estimate_mi` function, focusing on updating how 'discrete_features' is handled. The remaining search results provide a broader context of feature selection and preprocessing in scikit-learn, which might be useful for understanding the system's architecture and for possibly extending or testing the changes made to `_estimate_mi`.",
