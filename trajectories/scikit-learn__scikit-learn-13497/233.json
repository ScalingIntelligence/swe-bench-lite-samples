The `discrete_features` parameter can actually be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which means that direct comparison with `'auto'` could lead to errors, especially with future versions of numpy. This issue is clearly indicated in the `_estimate_mi` function's logic where the check `discrete_features == 'auto'` is used to determine the type of features. Additionally, there seems to be a concern that the function may not be tested with `discrete_features` set to anything other than `'auto'`. Given this context, the focus should be on identifying the specific spans within the `_estimate_mi` function that deal with the `discrete_features` parameter and its handling to address the potential numpy compatibility issue. The relevant spans include the block where `discrete_features` is processed, particularly the blocks that handle the conversion and application of the `discrete_mask`, i.e., the code where discrete_features are checked for boolean or array types, and where the error for sparse continuous features is raised. Also, to ensure comprehensive testing, it would be beneficial to include references or actionable steps to address the testing gap mentioned in the issue.",
