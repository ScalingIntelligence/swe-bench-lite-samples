This comparison could lead to errors when `discrete_features` is actually an array of indices or a boolean mask. The code span identified with the id `_estimate_mi` directly addresses this issue. In this function, there's a section where the `discrete_features` parameter is checked against 'auto'. If it's 'auto', the function sets `discrete_features` based on whether `X` is sparse. Further down, if `discrete_features` is a boolean or an array of indices/boolean mask, it converts or processes these accordingly.\n\nMoreover, the issue points out that it seems the function isn't tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'. The code spans `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` call `_estimate_mi` with the `discrete_features` parameter, indicating that these functions could be used to test different types of `discrete_features`.\n\nThus, these code spans appear to be highly relevant as they directly deal with handling `discrete_features` in the manner described in the issue and provide possible entry points for testing.",
