This function can accept 'discrete_features' as an array of indices or a boolean mask, but the current implementation only checks for 'auto' or a boolean value. The issue indicates that this will lead to an error in future versions of numpy due to incompatible types. Additionally, it notes that the function is not tested for cases where 'discrete_features' is not 'auto'. I reviewed the provided code and found that the '_estimate_mi' function indeed handles 'discrete_features' differently based on its type, implying that further code might expect 'discrete_features' to not just be 'auto'. The provided search results exactly match the context where 'discrete_features' is used in the '_estimate_mi' function, showing its implementation and the paths it takes based on its value.
