Also, it highlights that the function is never tested with discrete features not equal to 'auto'. Given this, it is crucial to identify the section in the code where this condition is evaluated and the subsequent handling of `discrete_features` to understand how it might need to be updated or tested further. Based on the provided search results, the function `_estimate_mi` directly addresses this issue, particularly in how it initializes `discrete_mask` based on the type of `discrete_features`. It first checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto' and then proceeds to determine the treatment of `discrete_features` depending on whether it is a boolean or an array. Thus, the identified code span ('_estimate_mi') is very relevant and touches upon the critical area for potential modifications or additional testing requirements.",
