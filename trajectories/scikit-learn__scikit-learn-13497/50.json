The issue also points out that there might be a lack of testing for cases where 'discrete_features' are not 'auto'. Upon analyzing the provided code, it's evident that the '_estimate_mi' function indeed compares 'discrete_features' to 'auto' to determine the behavior for sparse matrices. Additionally, the function handles various types of inputs for 'discrete_features' (boolean, array of indices, or boolean mask) which should mitigate the issue with future versions of numpy potentially not allowing comparisons between arrays and strings. However, the concern about testing should be addressed separately as per the issue's second part. Therefore, the relevant code spans are the ones handling the 'discrete_features' parameter in the '_estimate_mi' function.",
