This will cause errors in future versions of numpy. Examining the code span identified as '_estimate_mi' confirms that 'discrete_features' is compared to 'auto'. Additionally, the function logic after this comparison handles 'discrete_features' appropriately based on whether it's a boolean or an array. Therefore, this specific span is highly relevant to the reported issue and would require updating to handle the type comparison more robustly. Moreover, the other two identified functions 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' directly call '_estimate_mi', further emphasizing the importance of addressing this issue in '_estimate_mi' to ensure all dependent functions are compatible with future numpy versions. Overall, the identified span directly relates to the issued concern and offers clear points for potential modification to resolve the compatibility issue.",
