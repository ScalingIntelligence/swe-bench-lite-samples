Additionally, the issue mentions that the function might not be tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'. To address this, we need to: 1. Identify all instances where `discrete_features` is used and determine if it should be compared with 'auto' or handled differently when it's an array or boolean mask. 2. Review test cases to ensure there's coverage for when `discrete_features` is not 'auto'.",
