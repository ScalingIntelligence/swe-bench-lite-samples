The code analysis reveals that 'discrete_features' can indeed be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which is not handled correctly in the current implementation as it only checks against the string 'auto'. This can cause errors in future versions of numpy and indicates that the function might not be tested with 'discrete_features' != 'auto'. The code span identified in 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py' contains the function '_estimate_mi' which is directly relevant to the issue reported. The function contains the problematic comparison and handles the case when 'discrete_features' is 'auto' or a boolean, but lacks proper handling for when 'discrete_features' is an array of indices. This confirms the issue and identifies the exact location in the codebase that needs attention. Additionally, reviewing the entire 'sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py' file did not reveal any direct relevance to the specific issue of comparing 'discrete_features' with 'auto'. The file contains various checks and functions related to testing and validation of estimators, but none of these directly address the issue at hand.

This comparison will cause an error in future versions of numpy, as numpy's equality operator does not support comparing strings with arrays or masks. Additionally, the issue points out that there might be a lack of test coverage for cases where `discrete_features` is not 'auto'. The provided code in the <file_context> and <search_results> tags both show the implementation of `_estimate_mi` in the file 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py'. The function handles the `discrete_features` parameter by checking if it is 'auto', a boolean, or an array. If it is 'auto', it sets `discrete_features` to the result of `issparse(X)`. If `discrete_features` is a boolean, it creates a mask filled with that boolean. If `discrete_features` is an array, it converts it to a boolean array or mask. The reported issue is directly related to these sections of the code, which need to be modified to handle the numpy compatibility issue. The function also seems to be used in two other functions (`mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`), but these do not directly contribute to solving the reported issue.",
