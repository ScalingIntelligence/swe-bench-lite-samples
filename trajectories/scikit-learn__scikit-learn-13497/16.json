Examining the code in `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`, it is clear that the function `_estimate_mi` indeed compares `discrete_features` directly with the string `'auto'`. This comparison needs to be revised to accommodate the possibility of `discrete_features` being an array or a boolean mask. Additionally, the broader context of the function, including how it processes `discrete_features`, suggests that the existing code assumes `discrete_features` to be either a boolean or an index array, emphasizing the need for adjustments.
