This could lead to errors in future versions of numpy. Examining the code, the function '_estimate_mi' indeed contains the comparison 'discrete_features == 'auto'', which can potentially cause issues if 'discrete_features' is not the string 'auto'. The function then proceeds to handle 'discrete_features' by checking if it is a boolean or an array and creates a mask accordingly. The context of the issue suggests that there may be a need to revise the handling of 'discrete_features' to ensure compatibility with numpy updates and to possibly include tests where 'discrete_features' is not 'auto'. Based on the provided code, the relevant part pertains to the handling and comparison of 'discrete_features' within the '_estimate_mi' function.",
