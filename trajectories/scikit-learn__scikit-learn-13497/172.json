This could lead to errors in future versions of numpy. To resolve this, we need to identify where this comparison is being made and ensure that the handling of discrete_features can accommodate various types. Additionally, there seems to be a concern that the function might not be adequately tested with discrete_features that are not set to 'auto'. This suggests that a comprehensive test case should be developed to cover this scenario. Given the code context provided, it's clear that the _estimate_mi function exists in the sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py file. Therefore, the search should focus on this file to find the specific comparison and ensure there are comprehensive tests for different types of discrete_features.",
