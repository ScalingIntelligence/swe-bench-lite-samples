This needs to be updated to handle arrays properly.

There are also functions 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' that call '_estimate_mi', which might be of interest if further testing is required with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto'.

The '_estimate_mi' span that contains the logic for handling 'discrete_features', specifically where 'discrete_features == 'auto'' is checked.\n\nThese spans are the essential parts of the codebase that should be updated to resolve the reported issue.
