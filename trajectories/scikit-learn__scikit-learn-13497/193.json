This issue suggests that the function is not tested with `discrete_features` not equal to `'auto'`. In the provided file context, the `_estimate_mi` function handles `discrete_features` as expected, converting it to a boolean mask if necessary. However, the example provided in the search results does not directly test the case where `discrete_features` is an array or a boolean mask. Therefore, while the search results do not directly address the reported issue regarding the handling of `discrete_features`, they show an example usage of the `mutual_info_regression` function, which calls `_estimate_mi`, demonstrating that the function itself is at least used in practice. This can be an indirect evidence of the existence and perhaps intended use of the function in real-world scenarios, without direct testing of the issue pointed out. Thus, the search results can be considered somewhat relevant as they demonstrate real-world usage but do not directly address the testing concern raised in the issue.",
