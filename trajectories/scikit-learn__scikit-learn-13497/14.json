The concern is that `discrete_features` can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which would cause a future error with numpy. Additionally, the function's testing with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto' should be checked. Given the context, the focus of the search should be on functions and classes that either directly involve `_estimate_mi` or handle discrete features in a similar manner. The primary targets for the search are the `_estimate_mi` function itself and any other functions in the `mutual_info_.py` file that might interact with it. Also, any test functions specifically designed to validate the behavior of `_estimate_mi` with different types of `discrete_features` should be reviewed in `estimator_checks.py`.",
