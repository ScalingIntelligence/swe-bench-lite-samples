This could potentially break existing functionality if `discrete_features` is anything other than 'auto'. Additionally, the issue raises a concern about the function's ability to handle cases where `discrete_features` is not 'auto', as it suggests that the function may not be tested for such scenarios. Upon reviewing the code, specifically in the `_estimate_mi` function, it is clear that `discrete_features` is indeed processed differently based on whether it is 'auto', a boolean, or an array. This means the current implementation already handles some variation in `discrete_features`, except for the direct comparison to 'auto', which could be problematic. The solution might involve more robust type checking or adjustments to how `discrete_features` is validated and used within the function. Based on the issue and the code provided, both the `_estimate_mi`, `mutual_info_regression`, and `mutual_info_classif` functions are relevant since they are directly related to how discrete features are handled in mutual information estimation.",
