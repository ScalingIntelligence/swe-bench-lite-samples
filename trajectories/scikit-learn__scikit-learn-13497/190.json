This function can accept discrete features as an array of indices or a boolean mask, but the check for 'auto' does not account for these other types, which could lead to errors with future versions of numpy. By examining the `_estimate_mi` function in the provided search results, it's clear that it handles the 'auto' check, boolean, and array cases separately, but it does not handle the case where discrete_features is an array of indices explicitly. This function is also used in `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`, which might also need testing with discrete features not equal to 'auto'. Therefore, the search results contain the relevant code spans that need to be addressed to fix the potential numpy error and ensure the function is tested with various types of discrete features.",
