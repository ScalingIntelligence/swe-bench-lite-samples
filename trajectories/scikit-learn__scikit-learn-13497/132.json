This function takes a parameter `discrete_features` which can be either 'auto', a boolean, or an array of indices or a boolean mask. The current implementation of `_estimate_mi` checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto' and sets a boolean value accordingly. This could lead to errors when `discrete_features` is an array, as suggested by the issue. Reviewing the code, it's clear that `_estimate_mi` is the function in question, and the surrounding code provides context on how `discrete_features` is handled, including conversions to boolean masks and how continuous features are managed.

However, the specific comparison problem mentioned in the issue is not explicitly present in the provided file context. The code checks for 'auto' but does not directly compare a string to an array, indicating that the main concern about incorrect comparisons might not be represented here. Although the context seems to handle the input correctly, there is a lack of direct evidence that the code deals with incorrect comparisons as initially feared. Furthermore, testing for `discrete_features != 'auto'` has not been directly addressed in the file context. Thus, while the structure to handle `discrete_features` appears robust, the issue of comparison and the need for testing other values remain not fully resolved.",

The current implementation of `_estimate_mi` has a condition that checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto', and then proceeds to handle it accordingly. However, the issue suggests that there may be a potential error due to a misunderstanding or mismatch between the expected type of `discrete_features` and its actual usage. Specifically, handling 'auto' and comparing it directly to an array of indices or a boolean mask may lead to errors in future versions of numpy.\n\nTo address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans in the search results that directly manage the handling of `discrete_features` and ensure they appropriately differentiate between strings and arrays or booleans. The file context provided includes the definition of `_estimate_mi` where `discrete_features` is processed. I will ensure that the handling of `discrete_features` is robust enough to handle the different types expected.\n\nThe search results include additional files but the focus should remain on `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` as it contains the primary implementation of `_estimate_mi` and related functions. I will examine each span in detail to find the section where `discrete_features` is treated as 'auto' and contrast that with how arrays or booleans are handled.",

Specifically, the function `_estimate_mi` handles the 'discrete_features' parameter with a check for 'auto' and subsequently processes it as a boolean array. This suggests that the function is designed to handle both a boolean mask and an array of indices, although the direct comparison with 'auto' might be problematic if strict types are enforced. The code does not explicitly test with discrete features not equal to 'auto', which is a concern mentioned in the issue. Given the provided code and the handling of discrete_features beyond just the 'auto' value, this code context seems sufficient to understand the core functionality related to the issue.
