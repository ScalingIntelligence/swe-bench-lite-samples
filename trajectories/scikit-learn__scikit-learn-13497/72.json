The issue specifically notes that the function contains 'discrete_features == 'auto'' which can error when discrete_features is an array of indices or a boolean mask, as noted by future versions of numpy. The issue also points out that they never test this function with discrete features != 'auto'. From the provided code, it's clear that the function '_estimate_mi' initializes 'discrete_features' with 'auto', and then checks if it's a boolean, and eventually generates masks for discrete and continuous features based on 'discrete_features'. This directly addresses the first part of the issue, indicating the code already broadly handles different types of input for 'discrete_features'. However, the issue suggests that there may be a need to more explicitly test the function with 'discrete_features' not set to 'auto', which implies a suggestion to improve the testing of this function within the 'sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py' file.
