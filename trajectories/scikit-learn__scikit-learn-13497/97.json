This could cause errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, it seems that the function is not tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'. To address this, first, we need to identify all occurrences of this function and how `discrete_features` is being used throughout the codebase. Second, we should look for any test cases where `discrete_features` might be set to something other than 'auto'. So, we will search for the `_estimate_mi` function and also look for any tests related to `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` functions that might involve different values for `discrete_features`.",
