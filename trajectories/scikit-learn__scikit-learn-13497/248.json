The code span identified with the id `_estimate_mi` contains the relevant function where the comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'` occurs. This comparison could cause a problem if `discrete_features` is an array of indices or a boolean mask, as mentioned in the issue. The function also initializes `discrete_mask` based on the type of `discrete_features`, which needs to handle arrays and boolean masks appropriately. The other code spans, `mutual_info_classif` and `mutual_info_regression`, are calls to `_estimate_mi` and are indirectly related to the issue as they could trigger the problematic comparison. It appears that the majority of the logic to handle different types of `discrete_features` is in the `_estimate_mi` function, which is sufficient for addressing the issue.
