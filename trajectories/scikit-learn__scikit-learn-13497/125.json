The `discrete_features` parameter can be 'auto', an array of indices, or a boolean mask, but the current implementation might not handle non-'auto' cases correctly, potentially causing errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, it seems that the function hasn't been tested with `discrete_features` set to anything other than 'auto'. To address this, we need to focus on the `_estimate_mi` function and its usage, potentially including its callers.

Additionally, it is suggested that the function isn't tested with 'discrete_features' being anything other than 'auto'.

The code span within '_estimate_mi' that deals with 'discrete_features' is particularly relevant, as adjusting this part will fix the immediate issue.
