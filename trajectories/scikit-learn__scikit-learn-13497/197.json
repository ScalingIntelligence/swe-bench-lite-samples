The current implementation in the `_estimate_mi` function handles this by checking if `discrete_features` is 'auto' and then determining if `X` is sparse. If `discrete_features` is a boolean, it creates a mask filled with this boolean. If it's an array, it converts it into a boolean mask. The rest of the function processes this mask to separate continuous and discrete features. The search results include the `_estimate_mi` function, which directly addresses the issue by handling different types of discrete features as described. Therefore, the relevant code for addressing the issue is within the `_estimate_mi` function.",

Regarding testing, there are no direct tests for `_estimate_mi` with `discrete_features` other than 'auto' in the provided context. However, the function is used in `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`, which implies that it is tested indirectly through these higher-level functions.
