Upon reviewing the provided context and search results, it is clear that the issue is addressed within the `_estimate_mi` definition, specifically where `discrete_features` is initially set to 'auto' and then processed based on its type. The necessary handling for different types of `discrete_features` (boolean, array of indices, or boolean mask) is present in the `_estimate_mi` function as well, managing how these types are used further in the code.
