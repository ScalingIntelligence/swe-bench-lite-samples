Additionally, the issue highlights the need to ensure the function is tested with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto'. The provided code spans in 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py' include the '_estimate_mi' function where the problem exists, as well as other related functions like 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif'. These functions depend on '_estimate_mi' and could also be affected by the issue.
