The current implementation directly compares `discrete_features` with 'auto', which could cause issues with future versions of numpy since 'auto' is a string and the comparison with an array or boolean mask would not be appropriate. Additionally, the issue highlights the need to ensure this function is tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, the relevant code is found within the `_estimate_mi` function in the `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` file. This function contains the logic handling the `discrete_features` parameter, where it is initially checked against 'auto'. The rest of the function then processes `discrete_features` based on whether it is a boolean or an array of indices. Therefore, the identified code span is directly relevant to the reported issue, addressing the comparison and potential future compatibility issues.\n\nNo other sections are found in the search results that are directly related to the reported issue.
