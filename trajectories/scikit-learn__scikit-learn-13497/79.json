Therefore, the entire `_estimate_mi` span is relevant because it encompasses the problematic line and the surrounding logic related to `discrete_features`. Additionally, the `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` functions, which call `_estimate_mi`, are also relevant as they demonstrate how `discrete_features` is used in different contexts (continuous or discrete targets).
