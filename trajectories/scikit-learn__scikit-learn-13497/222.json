This issue is directly addressed in the `_estimate_mi` function in the 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py' file. The function provides handling for 'auto' as well as boolean and array types for `discrete_features`. It checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto', a boolean, or an array and handles each case accordingly, setting a mask for discrete features. Additionally, the issue suggests that the function is never tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto', which is critical for ensuring the robustness of this function. Given this, the relevant code spans include the entire `_estimate_mi` function definition and the two wrapper functions `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` which call `_estimate_mi` with different parameters. Therefore, these are the spans to be marked as relevant.",
