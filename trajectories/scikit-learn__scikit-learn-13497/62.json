The search results include the '_estimate_mi' function within the 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py' file, which is highly relevant to the issue. This function handles the 'discrete_features' parameter and includes conditional checks that cater to different possible types of 'discrete_features' (i.e., 'auto', boolean, and array indices/boolean mask). Although the current implementation seems to handle these cases, the concern about future errors with specific numpy versions and the insufficient testing of 'discrete_features' != 'auto' makes this code particularly relevant to review. Therefore, the code span in '_estimate_mi' is identified as relevant to address the reported issue.",

This comparison will lead to errors in future versions of numpy. The issue also mentions that there is no testing for `discrete_features != 'auto'`, suggesting a lack of coverage for this case in the test suite. Upon examining the provided code, the `_estimate_mi` function is indeed affected by this issue as it directly compares `discrete_features` to the string 'auto'. Additionally, the search results include implementations of `_estimate_mi`, `mutual_info_regression`, and `mutual_info_classif`, which are directly related to the reported issue as they use or call `_estimate_mi`. Since the focus of the issue is on the handling of `discrete_features` within `_estimate_mi`, the relevant code spans should include the sections of code in `_estimate_mi` that handle `discrete_features`, including the logic for setting `discrete_mask` based on the type and values of `discrete_features`. These sections need to be carefully revised to correctly handle the array and boolean cases for `discrete_features` without causing type comparison issues with numpy. Therefore, the identified spans include the definition of `_estimate_mi` and the sections within it that process `discrete_features`, as well as the function calls to `_estimate_mi` in `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`.",
