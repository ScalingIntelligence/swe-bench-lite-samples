This comparison can cause an error when 'discrete_features' is an array of indices or a boolean mask. The relevant part of the code that addresses this is found within the '_estimate_mi' function where the 'discrete_features' parameter is handled. The function checks the type of 'discrete_features' and processes it accordingly to determine a mask for discrete and continuous features. This section of the code is crucial because it directly addresses the issue of compatibility with different forms of 'discrete_features' and ensures the function can handle an array or boolean mask without errors. Additionally, the documentation of 'discrete_features' in the function's signature further supports its relevance to the reported issue.
