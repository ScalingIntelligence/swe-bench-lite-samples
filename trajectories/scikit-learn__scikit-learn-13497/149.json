This comparison might cause an error when `discrete_features` could be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which is not the intended behavior. The solution involves updating the function to handle `discrete_features` correctly, regardless of whether it is 'auto', an array, or a boolean mask. The provided search results contain the `_estimate_mi` function, which is directly related to the issue. The function's logic shows how it initializes and updates `discrete_mask` based on the type of `discrete_features`. By understanding this logic, we can determine that this function is the exact location where modifications are needed to address the issue. Specifically, the code needs to be updated to correctly handle different types of `discrete_features`: 'auto', boolean array, or array of feature indices. Furthermore, the search results also include the `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` functions, which call `_estimate_mi` and could be affected by any changes done in that function, but their inclusion here is more for context and understanding the interplay of these functions; they don't need direct changes in response to this particular issue.",
