The current file context indicates no relevant code has been identified yet. The search results reveal the implementation of the function `_estimate_mi` in the file `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`. This function handles the `discrete_features` parameter and includes logic to determine if features are discrete or continuous. Specifically, the function checks if `discrete_features` is equal to 'auto' and adjusts its behavior accordingly. This straightforward match with the reported issue makes the entire span of `_estimate_mi` relevant. Additionally, the function `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` which call `_estimate_mi` are also relevant because they are the public interface used to estimate mutual information, where the problem with `discrete_features` can arise. The other file in the search results, `examples/feature_selection/plot_f_test_vs_mi.py`, is related to usage examples and does not directly address the issue in question.",
