Analyzing the provided code, it's evident that the '_estimate_mi' function handles 'discrete_features' differently based on its type. The function checks if 'discrete_features' is 'auto', and if so, it sets 'discrete_features' based on whether the input X is sparse. If 'discrete_features' is a boolean, it creates a boolean mask. Otherwise, it treats 'discrete_features' as an array of indices or a boolean mask. This handling ensures that the function does work with 'discrete_features' being other than 'auto'. However, the comparison 'discrete_features == 'auto'' directly can lead to issues with numpy in future versions since numpy arrays do not directly support such comparison with strings. To address this, the function should likely handle 'discrete_features' more robustly, possibly by introducing a type check before the comparison to ensure compatibility with numpy's future versions. Additionally, the function '_estimate_mi' itself and the functions 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' that call it, are relevant to the issue since they all interact with or are affected by the 'discrete_features' parameter.",
