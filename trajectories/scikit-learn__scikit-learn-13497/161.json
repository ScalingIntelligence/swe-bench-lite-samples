The immediate task is to identify any additional occurrences of similar logic involving discrete_features where it might be compared directly to a string 'auto'. Moreover, there might be a lack of test coverage for scenarios where discrete_features is not set to 'auto'. Therefore, it's crucial to search for related test cases or additional functions in the codebase that could be impacted by this comparison. \n\nGiven the context of the files provided, it's clear that the primary focus should be on the mutual_info_.py file. However, to ensure thoroughness, a broader search across the project for occurrences of 'discrete_features' and specific queries related to this parameter's handling in functions like ' check_estimator' or '_warn_discrete_features' in the estimator_checks.py file should be conducted.",
