Specifically, the issue notes that `discrete_features == 'auto'` can lead to an error when `discrete_features` is an array of indices or a boolean mask, which is a valid use case. Additionally, it points out that the function might not be tested with `discrete_features != 'auto'. To address this, it's crucial to identify the relevant part of the code where `discrete_features` is handled and ensure it can properly accommodate arrays or boolean masks. The search results contain the `_estimate_mi` function which is critical for addressing the issue as it processes `discrete_features` and sets up the masks for discrete and continuous features. This function should be thoroughly reviewed and potentially adjusted to handle the scenarios mentioned.",
