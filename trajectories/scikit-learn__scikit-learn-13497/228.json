This comparison will cause errors in future versions of numpy, as numpy will not allow comparing strings to arrays. The function `_estimate_mi` is part of the `mutual_info_.py` file. This function has a parameter `discrete_features` which can be 'auto', an array of indices, or a boolean mask. The primary objective is to identify the use of `discrete_features == 'auto'` within the `_estimate_mi` function and ensure that it handles the array or boolean mask cases correctly. Additionally, the unit tests for this function should be reviewed to ensure that all cases, especially when `discrete_features` is not 'auto', are adequately tested.",
