Additionally, the issue mentions a lack of testing for cases where 'discrete_features' is not 'auto'. Looking at the provided code, the function '_estimate_mi' indeed contains the problematic comparison 'discrete_features == 'auto'', and subsequent handling of 'discrete_features' when it is a boolean or an array. The related functions 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' call '_estimate_mi' and would therefore also need updating if '_estimate_mi' is changed.
