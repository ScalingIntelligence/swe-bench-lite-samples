The `discrete_features` parameter can be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which will cause an error when compared directly to a string in future versions of numpy. Upon analyzing the provided search results, I found the relevant code span in the `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` file, specifically in the `_estimate_mi` function where the comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'` occurs. This is significant because it directly addresses the reported issue of future errors due to the comparison between a string and an array or boolean mask. Additionally, this function doesn't seem to be tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto', as noted in the issue. The identified code span is crucial for any future modifications to fix this issue and enhance testing scenarios.",

Additionally, the file context includes the `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` functions that use `_estimate_mi`, indicating where testing might occur with different settings for `discrete_features`.
