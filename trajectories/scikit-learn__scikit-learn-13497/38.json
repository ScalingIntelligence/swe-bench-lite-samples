The current implementation seems to compare `discrete_features` with 'auto', which is problematic if `discrete_features` is an array. Additionally, it appears that the function is not tested with `discrete_features` set to anything other than 'auto'. The focus should be on the `_estimate_mi` function within the `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` file to ensure that the comparison is handled correctly and to verify that the function is tested with other possible values for `discrete_features`.",

This comparison can cause errors when `discrete_features` is an array of indices or a boolean mask, as indicated in the numpy documentation. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the `discrete_features` parameter in the `_estimate_mi` function. The provided search results include the function definition and the handling of the `discrete_features` parameter. The code checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto' and sets it to a boolean based on whether `X` is sparse. If `discrete_features` is a boolean, it creates a mask, and if it's an array, it converts it to a boolean mask. This logic is relevant to the reported issue as it directly addresses the entry point for handling `discrete_features`. Additionally, the search results include two other functions, `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`, which call `_estimate_mi`, indicating that they are also related to the mutual information estimation process.",
