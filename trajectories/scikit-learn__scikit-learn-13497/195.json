This directly addresses the reported issue regarding the conditional handling of `discrete_features`.\n\n- The function also checks if the `discrete_features` is an array and how it should be handled.\n\nThe other files and functions listed in the search results do not directly relate to the issue at hand, which is specifically about the handling of `discrete_features` in the `_estimate_mi` function.

Additionally, it seems that the function hasn't been tested with `discrete_features` not being 'auto'.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, we see the `_estimate_mi` function handling the conversion from 'auto' to a boolean mask and the conversion from a list of indices or a boolean array to a boolean mask. This confirms that the function already has some handling for `discrete_features` not being 'auto'. However, there's no explicit test or usage case shown where `discrete_features` is not 'auto', which aligns with the concern that this hasn't been tested.\n\nThe relevant code spans are the parts of `_estimate_mi` that handle the `discrete_features` variable, converting it into a boolean mask and using it to distinguish between discrete and continuous features.

This evaluation is problematic because 'discrete_features' can be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which will cause an error with future versions of numpy. The provided search results include the '_estimate_mi' function which is directly related to the issue. The function checks the type of 'discrete_features' and assigns a 'discrete_mask' accordingly. There is also a check to raise a ValueError if there are continuous features in a sparse matrix, which is relevant to the functionality but not directly to the string comparison issue. The function '_estimate_mi' should be modified to handle the 'discrete_features' parameter more robustly to avoid the numpy error. Additionally, the function should be tested with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto' to ensure it operates correctly with different inputs.",
