The problem is the comparison of the 'discrete_features' parameter with the string 'auto', while 'discrete_features' can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask. This comparison might lead to errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, the function does not seem to be tested with 'discrete_features' set to anything other than 'auto'. To address the issue, we need to identify where and how 'discrete_features' is set and ensure that the function can handle its different possible types.",

The code snippet provided shows the implementation of '_estimate_mi' and how it handles the 'discrete_features' parameter: It first checks if 'discrete_features' is 'auto' and sets 'discrete_features' to a boolean indicating if 'X' is sparse. If 'discrete_features' is a boolean, it creates a boolean mask filled with this value. If 'discrete_features' is an array, it converts it to a boolean mask. This clearly addresses the issue of handling arrays or boolean masks, but the issue also mentions that the function might not be tested with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto'. There is a need to ensure testing covers this case to prevent future errors. Given the analysis, the search results are relevant as they show the actual implementation handling the 'discrete_features' parameter, which is directly related to the reported issue. However, it does not address the testing concern mentioned in the issue.",

To address this: 1. Reviewed the current file context in `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` and confirmed the presence of `_estimate_mi` with the cited comparison. 2. Analyzed new search results to identify additional relevant code spans: found `_compute_mi` which is utilized within `_estimate_mi` to compute mutual information based on feature types. Also, reviewed `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` since they directly call `_estimate_mi`. 3. Given the issue's requirement for handling discrete features as arrays or boolean masks, inspected code spans handling these cases in `_estimate_mi`. 4. Evaluated if further modifications to `_estimate_mi` are needed for handling array inputs, focusing specifically on updating the condition to accommodate array types. The search results offer a comprehensive view of function interactions and utility, aligning well with the issue's request for improved type handling. The identified code spans should help in addressing the issue effectively.",
