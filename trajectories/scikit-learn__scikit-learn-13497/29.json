Upon examining the `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` file, it's evident that the `_estimate_mi` function indeed contains the line in question. This function contains the logic that handles the `discrete_features` parameter, including the comparison and subsequent handling based on whether the feature is discrete or continuous. The function also includes the code that checks if `discrete_features` is a boolean or an array and adjusts the `discrete_mask` accordingly. The analysis of the entire section of code revealed that this indeed addresses the issue directly. There are no references outside this section that appear relevant, so the search seems complete based on the provided code. An additional note is that the function `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` both call `_estimate_mi`, implying that any changes in `_estimate_mi` will affect these functions as well. However, they don't directly contribute to the identified issue, so they are not marked as relevant spans themselves.",
