This implies that the current implementation might not handle these cases properly. Additionally, it suggests that the function might not be adequately tested for `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'. To address this, we need to identify the exact location of the `_estimate_mi` function and check for instances where `discrete_features` is compared to 'auto', ensuring both the implementation and tests are robust. Given the context provided, the function `_estimate_mi` is located in `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`, so we do not need to search further for the function itself. However, we should look for any tests related to this function to ensure it handles all cases of `discrete_features`.",

While this covers the direct comparison of `discrete_features` with 'auto', there is no explicit handling or comparison for when `discrete_features` is an array of indices or a boolean mask. This suggests that while the current implementation addresses part of the issue, it does not fully cover the case where `discrete_features` is not 'auto'.

The issue specifically points out that the check `discrete_features == 'auto'` may lead to errors when `discrete_features` is an array of indices or a boolean mask. Additionally, it raises concerns about the lack of testing for cases where `discrete_features` is not 'auto'. The file context provides the relevant snippets of code from the `mutual_info_.py` file, which includes the `_estimate_mi` function. The search results also provide more context on the function and its dependencies in the same file. The analysis indicates that the `_estimate_mi` function definition includes the problematic line `if discrete_features == 'auto':`, which needs to be adjusted to handle array inputs properly. Furthermore, the rest of the function needs review to ensure comprehensive testing for discrete features of different types.",

Given the code snippet, the function transforms the input into a boolean mask if it is an array of indices, which suggests that it should handle such cases. However, we should broaden our search to ensure there are no missed edge cases or incorrect comparisons within the `_estimate_mi` function or related methods.
