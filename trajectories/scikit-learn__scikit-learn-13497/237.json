This will likely cause errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, there is a concern that the function might not be tested with `discrete_features` set to anything other than 'auto'. The analysis of the given search results shows that the entire logic related to handling `discrete_features` is contained within the `_estimate_mi` function. The function first checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto' and sets it to `issparse(X)` if true. Then, it proceeds to handle `discrete_features` based on whether it is a boolean or an array, creating masks for both discrete and continuous features. This comprehensive handling of different types of `discrete_features` indicates that the function is likely designed to work with various inputs. However, the issue about testing remains. Given the detailed handling of `discrete_features` in the `_estimate_mi` function, and considering that the reported issue specifically mentions this function, I conclude that the identified span containing `_estimate_mi` is relevant to the reported issue.",
