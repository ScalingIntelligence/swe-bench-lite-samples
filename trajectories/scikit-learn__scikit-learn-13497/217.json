Additionally, it's mentioned that this function might not be tested with `discrete_features != 'auto', which should be addressed during the fix.\n\nIn the provided file context and search results, I see that `_estimate_mi` is defined and within this function, we handle the `discrete_features` parameter and determine the `discrete_mask`. The key part where the issue is relevant is in lines where `discrete_features` is processed and where the mask is created based on whether it's a boolean or an array of indices. The function that largely solves the issue is '_estimate_mi' itself because it is where we decide the type and handling of 'discrete_features' which seems like the main problematic section.\n\nDespite this, I did not find specifications for the function that would actually test the altered '_estimate_mi' function with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'. Although the current context strongly suggests that identified span affects the overall problem statement directly (as it is where we deal with the 'discrete_features'), I believe there are minimum precursors to saying that completeness achieved for implementing the new thing as the issue indicates - that we should test the function with 'discrete_features != 'auto'', is still not seen in the context provided.\n\nSo based on the current search results and file context, I would identify the span relevant to fixing the reported issue in '_estimate_mi' but it's not yet clear where and how would we test this code with such conditions, aside from fixing seen problem.",
