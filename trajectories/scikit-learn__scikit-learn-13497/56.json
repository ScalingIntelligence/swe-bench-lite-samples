This parameter can be 'auto', an array of indices, or a boolean mask, but the current implementation seemed to only directly check against the string 'auto'. This could potentially cause issues with future versions of numpy. Additionally, the issue raises a concern that the function might not be tested for cases where `discrete_features` is not 'auto'. Given this context, the focus should be on `_estimate_mi` function and its handling of `discrete_features`. From the provided search results, the function `_estimate_mi` directly addresses these concerns with its handling of `discrete_features`. Specifically, the function manages different types of `discrete_features` inputs, including arrays and boolean masks, and processes them appropriately to derive the `discrete_mask` and `continuous_mask`. This directly addresses the issue of potential errors in future numpy versions and ensures that the function can handle non-'auto' values of `discrete_features`. Therefore, the relevant code spans are clearly within the definition of `_estimate_mi` function in the provided file.",
