After analyzing the code, it's clear that the `_estimate_mi` function handles the 'auto' case and checks if `discrete_features` is a boolean. However, it lacks handling for when `discrete_features` is an array of indices. The relevant code spans include the entire `_estimate_mi` function where the parameter is being checked and handled.
