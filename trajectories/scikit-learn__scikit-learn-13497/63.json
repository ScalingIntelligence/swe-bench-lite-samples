This comparison might lead to errors in future versions of numpy and it also noted that this function might not be tested with discrete features not equal to 'auto'. After reviewing the search results, I found the `_estimate_mi` function and the functions that call it, `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`, all within `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`. These functions deal directly with handling discrete features and could be implicated in the issue. In contrast, the other file (`sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py`) appears to be testing utilities and unrelated to the specific issue at hand. Therefore, it does not contain relevant spans. Based on the alignment of the identified code spans with the reported issue, I select the ones in `mutual_info_.py`. The presence of handling for discrete features and the direct interaction with `discrete_features` parameter confirm their relevance. Additionally, the observation that `discrete_features` could be an array or boolean mask aligns with the need to handle such types differently. The search is therefore considered complete as it directly addresses the concern in the reported issue.",

Notably, there are helper functions and checks such as `check_estimators_dtypes`, `check_classifier_data_not_an_array`, `check_regressor_data_not_an_array`, and `check_estimators_data_not_an_array` which might be relevant for testing estimators but do not specifically address the immediate issue described in `_estimate_mi`. The function `multioutput_estimator_convert_y_2d` is also found, which hints at broader handling of estimator inputs but does not directly contribute to the solution of the described issue.\n\nGiven the analysis, the search for additional relevant code spans is not complete. There is no direct evidence that `_estimate_mi` is thoroughly tested for different types of `discrete_features` other than 'auto'. More specifically, we need to check if there are unit tests or validation functions that ensure `_estimate_mi` can handle arrays or boolean masks for `discrete_features`, which could provide a clearer picture of the robustness of this function with respect to the reported issue.",

The reported issue highlights a direct concern with the `_estimate_mi` function, specifically the handling of `discrete_features` parameter which can be 'auto', an array of indices, or a boolean mask. The current implementation uses a direct comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'`, which is likely to cause errors when `discrete_features` is an array or boolean mask. This issue is clearly present in the code span provided with the id '_estimate_mi'. \n2. The analysis of the relevant file 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py' shows that the `_estimate_mi` function initializes and checks the type of `discrete_features`. It converts it into a boolean mask (`discrete_mask`) which is then used to determine the continuous mask. \n3. The function is used in two other places within the same file: `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` showing its direct relevance to the handling of mutual information in regression and classification tasks respectively. \n4. Additional checks are not necessary as the existing code span and its usage already encompass the reported issue. The implementation directly affects the way discrete and continuous features are treated based on the `discrete_features` parameter and how this is then used in subsequent calculations within the same module. Therefore, it seems that the right code span has been identified as relevant to the reported issue and there is no need to look further based on the given context. Issues related to testing with `discrete_features != 'auto'` specifically are not addressed by the current search results, but those would warrant a separate analysis and possibly additional code integration.",
