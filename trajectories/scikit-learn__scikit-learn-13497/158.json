            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue identifies a problem with the handling of the 'discrete_features' parameter in the '_estimate_mi' function. Specifically, the current implementation checks if 'discrete_features' is equal to 'auto', which can cause errors when 'discrete_features' is an array of indices or a boolean mask. Additionally, there is a concern that the function might not be adequately tested for cases where 'discrete_features' is not 'auto'.\n\nUpon examining the search results, the relevant code spans are clearly associated with the '_estimate_mi' function and its handling of the 'discrete_features' parameter. The function starts by checking the value of 'discrete_features' and depending on whether it is 'auto', a boolean, or an array, it sets a 'discrete_mask' accordingly. The code span immediately following the initial check handles the conversion of 'discrete_features' into a 'discrete_mask', which is a boolean array indicating which features are discrete and which are continuous. This span is critical for addressing the issue as it directly involves the problematic 'discrete_features == 'auto' comparison and subsequent handling of other types of 'discrete_features'.\n\nThe identified code spans appear to cover the necessary logic for handling 'discrete_features'. However, the issue also raises concerns about testing. While the search results do not provide explicit test cases, the presence of the implementation suggests that further tests might be necessary to ensure all types of inputs for 'discrete_features' are adequately covered and do not cause errors.\n\nFor these reasons, the relevant code spans are accurately identified and should be sufficient for addressing the reported issue.",
