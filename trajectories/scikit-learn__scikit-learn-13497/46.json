This could lead to future errors in numpy. Additionally, it suggests that the function may not be adequately tested when `discrete_features` is not 'auto'. Therefore, the primary focus should be on modifying `_estimate_mi` to handle array inputs for `discrete_features` properly and testing this condition.",

This condition checks if the `discrete_features` parameter is set to 'auto' and if so, sets it based on whether the input matrix `X` is sparse. The function further processes `discrete_features` to create a boolean mask regardless of its initial type, handling both array inputs and boolean values appropriately thereafter. This indicates that the function is equipped to handle different types of `discrete_features` inputs after the initial condition. Additionally, the function does not impose any restrictions that would inherently cause errors with an array input for `discrete_features`. Although the function does not explicitly test for `discrete_features` being an array other than 'auto', the processing logic ensures that handling arrays is integrated into the function's normal behavior. Therefore, considering the function's ability to process different types of `discrete_features`, the current file context seems complete in addressing the reported issue.",
