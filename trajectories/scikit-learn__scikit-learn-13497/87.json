Specifically, the condition `discrete_features == 'auto'` can lead to an error if `discrete_features` is an array of indices or a boolean mask. The current context already includes relevant parts of the code, including the `_estimate_mi` function. The new search results also contain the `_estimate_mi` function, which is crucial for addressing the issue. Analysis of the `_estimate_mi` function reveals that it checks `discrete_features` and processes it accordingly. To fix the issue, we need to ensure that `discrete_features` is properly handled when it is not the string 'auto'. This involves parsing `discrete_features` into a boolean mask or array of indices correctly. The identified code spans from the `_estimate_mi` function are relevant to addressing the issue, including the handling of `discrete_features` and the conversion of `discrete_features` into a mask. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete with the provided code spans.",

This indicates that the necessary logic is in place to handle cases where `discrete_features` is not 'auto'. The functions `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` both call `_estimate_mi`, suggesting that if additional testing or changes are needed, they would likely occur in these functions or the helper function `_compute_mi`. However, the context does not explicitly show tests or other code that uses `discrete_features` with array or boolean mask values. To confirm completeness, we should look for test cases or other sections of the code that utilize different values of `discrete_features`. Additionally, after reviewing the code, it's clear that there are no invalid comparisons between strings and arrays within `_estimate_mi`, which addresses the error concern in the issue.",
