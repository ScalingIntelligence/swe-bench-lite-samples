This function is designed to handle both boolean masks and array of indices for discrete features, but the current implementation falls short in properly differentiating and utilizing these types through the comparison at the beginning of the function. It seems to cover converting directly into a boolean mask if none given correctly. However, when analyzing the provided code within the _estimate_mi function, it clearly converts discrete_features into either a boolean mask or retains it as an array if provided. This aligns with the issue's concern about lack of testing using discrete features not equal to 'auto'. By looking at the function's internal handling of discrete_features, one can see that additional unit tests whether by passing boolean masks directly or discretely indexed arrays should reinforce its resilience against type-related errors anticipated by the Napa upgrade.",
