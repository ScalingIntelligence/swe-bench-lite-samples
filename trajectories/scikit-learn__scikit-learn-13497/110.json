However, 'discrete_features' can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which is not properly handled by this comparison and could lead to errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, the issue points out that the function might not be tested with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto'. This indicates a potential gap in the function's robustness and test coverage. \n\nThe provided search results contain the 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py' file, which includes the '_estimate_mi' function. This function currently handles the 'discrete_features' parameter by checking if it is 'auto' and then setting a mask based on whether the features are discrete or continuous. This is exactly where the issue lies, as 'discrete_features' can be more complex than just 'auto' or a boolean. The rest of the function processes this mask to compute mutual information. Therefore, the 'discrete_features' handling in this function is directly relevant to the reported issue and should be addressed to handle array indices and boolean masks appropriately.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' functions, which call '_estimate_mi', suggests that these functions might also need to be checked or modified if they inherit the same handling of 'discrete_features'. It's not clear from the provided code if these higher-level functions are tested separately, which is another point of concern mentioned in the issue.\n\nTaking into account the nature of the reported issue and the context provided in the search results, the identified span is '_estimate_mi', as it directly pertains to the problem of comparing 'discrete_features' to 'auto'.",
