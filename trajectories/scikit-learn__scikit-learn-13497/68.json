The current implementation uses 'discrete_features == 'auto'' to determine if the features are discrete, but this can be an array of indices or a boolean mask. This direct comparison to a string 'auto' might cause errors in future versions of numpy. Also, the issue highlights that the function is not tested with 'discrete_features' set to anything other than 'auto'. Examining the code, the '_estimate_mi' function in the provided search results indeed checks if 'discrete_features' is 'auto' and then assigns a boolean value based on whether the input is sparse. However, there is no handling for when 'discrete_features' is a boolean mask or an array of indices, which could potentially lead to issues. Given this concern, the code span identified by the '_estimate_mi' ID is directly relevant to the issue as it pertains to the problematic handling of 'discrete_features'.",
