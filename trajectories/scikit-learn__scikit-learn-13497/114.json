The current implementation checks if 'discrete_features' is 'auto' and then assigns a boolean value based on whether the input matrix 'X' is sparse. However, the issue notes that 'discrete_features' can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which might cause a future error in numpy. Additionally, it suggests that the function is never tested with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto'. To address this, we need to find the relevant code span where the handling of 'discrete_features' occurs. Upon examination of the provided code, the entire '_estimate_mi' function is relevant as it contains the logic for handling 'discrete_features'. This includes the conditional check for 'auto', the conversion to a boolean mask, and the subsequent use of this mask to differentiate between continuous and discrete features. The 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' functions, which call '_estimate_mi', are not directly related to the issue but serve to illustrate the broader context of the function's use.",
