Upon examining the search results, the '_estimate_mi' function contains the relevant code where 'discrete_features' is initially compared to 'auto'. This comparison is followed by a handling mechanism that checks if 'discrete_features' is a boolean or an array. If 'discrete_features' is a boolean, it creates a mask and applies it to determine which features are discrete or continuous. If 'discrete_features' is not a boolean, it converts it to an array and proceeds with the same mask creation process. The function 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' both call '_estimate_mi' with appropriate parameters, which indicates that the functionality is used in practical implementations. The analysis shows that the relevant code spans are located in the '_estimate_mi' function, suggesting that addressing the issue would involve modifying the comparison and subsequent handling of 'discrete_features' to ensure compatibility with array and boolean inputs. Additionally, considering the broader context of the reported issue, it is crucial to ensure that the function is tested with different types and values of 'discrete_features' to avoid potential errors in future versions of numpy.",
