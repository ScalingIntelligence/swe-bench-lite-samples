The issue mentions that `discrete_features` can be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which could cause an error in future versions of numpy when compared directly with a string. The search results show the code span containing the `_estimate_mi` function and its related functions `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif`. These functions are directly related to the reported issue as they use the `_estimate_mi` function with the `discrete_features` parameter. Additionally, there is no code identified in the current file context, indicating that these search results are the first set of relevant code spans. After reviewing the entire code section in the search results, it is evident that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue. The analysis also shows that the code spans cover the handling of different types of `discrete_features`, including the 'auto' case, boolean, and array types, which directly addresses the issue.",
