This comparison can be problematic if 'discrete_features' is expected to be an array of indices or a boolean mask. Upon reviewing the code, it is clear that the function indeed performs this comparison. Additionally, the function branches out based on the type of 'discrete_features' to handle different scenarios, but it appears that there may not be comprehensive testing for cases where 'discrete_features' is not 'auto'. This aligns with the concern raised in the reported issue, making the code within '_estimate_mi' directly relevant to addressing the issue. Other functions, 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif', which call '_estimate_mi', are also indirectly relevant as they may be impacted by the changes needed in '_estimate_mi'.",
