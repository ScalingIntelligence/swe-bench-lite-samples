The goal is to ensure the function is robust against the various values `discrete_features` can take. Given the context, the function already includes logic to handle `discrete_features` as an array of indices or a boolean mask, but there are no explicit tests noted in the context provided. Thus, the search should be refined to look for any implicit handling or assumptions within the function's code flow related to `discrete_features` other than 'auto'.",
