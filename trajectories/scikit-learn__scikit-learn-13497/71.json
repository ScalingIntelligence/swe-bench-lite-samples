This comparison might lead to errors in future versions of numpy and also indicates that the function might not be properly tested with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto'. To address this, we need to locate specific instances of the '_estimate_mi' function to ensure that the comparison logic is corrected and that there are tests covering the different types of 'discrete_features'. Additionally, since the issue relates to discrete features, it may also be relevant to look for tests or usages of 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' functions where 'discrete_features' is manually set to an array or boolean mask to ensure these cases are tested.",

The provided search results contain the _estimate_mi function, as well as the mutual_info_regression and mutual_info_classif functions that call _estimate_mi. These are directly relevant to the issue, as they show how discrete_features are initially checked and how they can be arrays or boolean masks.
