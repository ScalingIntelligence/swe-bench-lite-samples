This can lead to errors with future versions of numpy. Additionally, it indicates that the function has not been tested with `discrete_features` being anything other than 'auto'. Upon reviewing the search results, I identified the relevant code in the `_estimate_mi` function where `discrete_features` is handled. This code block appropriately deals with boolean masks and arrays of indices. However, the presence of the 'auto' check needs to be addressed to handle arrays or masks directly, ensuring compatibility with future numpy versions. No additional relevant code was found, suggesting that the current search results cover the necessary code spans to address the reported issue. Therefore, I conclude that the search is complete with these identified spans.",
