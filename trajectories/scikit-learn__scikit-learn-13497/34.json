This can cause errors, especially in future versions of numpy. Upon analyzing the search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are in the '_estimate_mi' function where the 'discrete_features' parameter is handled. There are sections where 'discrete_features' is compared directly to 'auto' and where its type is checked to determine if it is a boolean or an array. These sections are likely to be where the issue arises and where corrections need to be made to handle the different types correctly. The analysis of the function indicates that there is indeed a potential for errors when 'discrete_features' is not 'auto', as its handling relies on direct comparisons and assumptions about its type. Therefore, this function needs to be updated to handle all potential types of 'discrete_features' appropriately. No other functions directly related to the handling of 'discrete_features' were found in the provided search results, suggesting the search can be considered complete based on the provided context and code spans.",

Specifically, `discrete_features` can be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which will lead to error in future versions of numpy due to the type mismatch. The code section provided in the search results in the `_estimate_mi` function directly addresses this issue. Inside this function, the `discrete_features` parameter is checked for equality to 'auto' and then processed further based on its type. This section of code is exactly what needs to be adjusted or tested to ensure compatibility with both string 'auto' and other array-like types for `discrete_features`. Additionally, it's noted that the function may not be tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto', which suggests the need for additional test cases. The provided code already covers handling different types of `discrete_features`, so there's a need to ensure comprehensive testing is in place.",
