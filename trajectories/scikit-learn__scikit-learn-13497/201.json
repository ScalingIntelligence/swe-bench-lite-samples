The function handles cases where `discrete_features` is 'auto', a boolean, or an array through careful type checking and conversion. While there is a direct comparison of `discrete_features` with 'auto', the function uses an `if-else` structure to manage different types, including arrays or boolean masks, suggesting a thorough handling of the parameter's different possible types. Additionally, the function's handling of sparse matrices and continuous features indicates a design that aims to avoid errors and manage different data types effectively. The presence of tests through function calls like `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` also suggests an attempt to cover various scenarios where `discrete_features` could be set differently. Thus, all relevant code paths and types concerning the `discrete_features` parameter seem covered in the provided context.",
