This could lead to errors in future versions of numpy.

The issue also points out that the function might not be tested with `discrete_features` set to values other than 'auto'. The relevant part of the code in question is in the `_estimate_mi` function where the `discrete_features` parameter is checked against 'auto'. In the current context and search results, the function correctly handles the 'auto' setting by setting `discrete_features` to `issparse(X)`. However, the code also handles other types of `discrete_features`, including arrays of indices or boolean masks. The search results confirm the presence of the handling logic for different types of `discrete_features` in the `_estimate_mi` function. Therefore, the search results provide a comprehensive view of how the `discrete_features` argument is managed within the function, and they are directly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
