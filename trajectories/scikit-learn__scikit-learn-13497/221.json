The current implementation directly compares 'discrete_features' with 'auto', which may cause issues with arrays in future versions of numpy. By analyzing the code in the 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py' file, I identified the '_estimate_mi' function where the comparison is made. This function also handles the conversion of 'discrete_features' to a discrete mask based on whether it is a boolean or an array. Additionally, the file contains two wrapper functions 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' that call '_estimate_mi' with different parameters related to the target's discreteness. These functions might also be relevant for testing scenarios where 'discrete_features' is not 'auto'. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to address the reported issue.",
