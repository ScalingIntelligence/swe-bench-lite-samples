The function `_estimate_mi` is defined in the `mutual_info_.py` file. Since `_estimate_mi` is crucial for understanding and resolving the issue, it is likely the main focus. However, to ensure comprehensive coverage, the related functions `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` should also be examined for any interactions or shared logic that might involve `discrete_features`. Additionally, since the issue identifies a lack of testing for `discrete_features` when not 'auto', it would be prudent to check the `estimator_checks.py` file for any regression or classification tests that could be involved with the function.",
