The issue points out that 'discrete_features' can be an array of indices or a boolean mask, and comparing it to 'auto' will cause errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, it suggests that the function might not be tested with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto'.\n\nFrom the file context and search results, the function '_estimate_mi' is the main focus as it contains the problematic comparison. The function handles the 'discrete_features' parameter in three different ways depending on its type. If it's 'auto', it sets 'discrete_features' to the result of 'issparse(X)'. If it's a boolean, it creates a mask filled with that boolean value. If it's an array or list, it creates a mask by activating the indices specified in the array or list. This logic seems to cover the handling of 'discrete_features' as an array or boolean mask, aligning with the issue description.\n\nThe identified code spans include the entire '_estimate_mi' function as well as the functions 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' which call '_estimate_mi'.

This demonstrates that the function can handle `discrete_features` as an array or boolean mask, addressing the numpy error mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the function `_compute_mi` is defined to compute mutual information based on whether features are discrete or continuous, which is used in `_estimate_mi`.
