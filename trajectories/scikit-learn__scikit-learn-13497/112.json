The issue also points out that this function is not being tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'. The search results include the `_estimate_mi` function definition, as well as the functions `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` that call `_estimate_mi`. The code spans that are relevant to the reported issue include the handling of `discrete_features` in `_estimate_mi`, as well as the calls to `_estimate_mi` in both `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` to ensure that changes in `_estimate_mi` do not inadvertently affect other parts of the code.
