This discrepancy could lead to errors, especially with future versions of numpy. Additionally, the issue raises concerns about the lack of testing for cases where `discrete_features` are not 'auto', potentially missing edge cases in unit tests.\n\nThrough the search results, specifically the `_estimate_mi` function in the `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` file, we can identify the relevant code span that directly deals with the `discrete_features` parameter handling. The function checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto' and subsequently determines the `discrete_mask` based on whether `discrete_features` is a boolean or an array of indices/boolean masks. This span is critical as it's where the problem lies and needs to be addressed to ensure compatibility with numpy's future versions and also to cover additional test cases where `discrete_features` are not 'auto'.\n\nGiven the detailed examination, the specific code span within the `_estimate_mi` function that handles the `discrete_features` parameter is identified as relevant and needs immediate attention to rectify the issue and ensure comprehensive testing is in place.",
