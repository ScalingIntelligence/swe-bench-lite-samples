The problem lies in the comparison 'discrete_features == 'auto'', which does not account for 'discrete_features' being an array of indices or a boolean mask, which could lead to errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, the issue highlights the potential lack of testing for 'discrete_features' with values other than 'auto'. Upon examining the provided search results, it is clear that the function '_estimate_mi' directly involves the handling of 'discrete_features'. The code checks if 'discrete_features' is 'auto' and then decides whether to treat all features as discrete or not based on whether the input matrix is sparse. The function also allows for 'discrete_features' to be a boolean or an array, and appropriately handles these inputs. This direct relevance with the issue makes the '_estimate_mi' function's handling of 'discrete_features' highly relevant to the reported issue. However, it's worth noting that the rest of the search results, such as 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif', which call '_estimate_mi', are also potentially relevant as they provide context on how '_estimate_mi' is used in the codebase.",
