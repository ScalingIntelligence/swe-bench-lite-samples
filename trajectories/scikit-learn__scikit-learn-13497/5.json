This comparison will cause an error in future versions of numpy. To address this issue, it is crucial to identify the code span where 'discrete_features' is compared to 'auto'. From the search results, it is clear that the 'discrete_features' parameter is compared to 'auto' in the '_estimate_mi' function. This function is defined to handle the estimation of mutual information between variables. The analysis of the entire function is necessary to understand how 'discrete_features' is processed further. The function checks if 'discrete_features' is 'auto' and determines the next steps based on whether the input is sparse. The function also handles both boolean and array types for 'discrete_features'. The relevant code spans include the entire '_estimate_mi' function and possibly the 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' functions where '_estimate_mi' is called, as these functions might need updates if there are changes to how 'discrete_features' is handled.
