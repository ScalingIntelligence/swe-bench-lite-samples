The issue concerns the handling of `discrete_features` which can be an array of indices or a boolean mask, leading to potential errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, ensuring the function is tested with `discrete_features != 'auto'` needs to be considered. Diving into the provided search results, the most relevant piece of code is indeed the `_estimate_mi` function. This function checks the type of `discrete_features` and handles it appropriately based on whether it is 'auto', a boolean, or an array. The way `discrete_features` is processed within this function suggests a clear link to the reported issue. As for testing the function with `discrete_features != 'auto'`, it might require additional testing code, which as currently reported, seems lacking. This implies that the current search results do not cover this aspect but are clearly related to the numpy issue at hand. Neither the other files in the search results offer a direct connection or mention of `_estimate_mi` or `discrete_features` beyond the initial utility check functions. Consequently, it appears that the provided search results sufficiently cover the direct concerns related to the reported issue, exclusively pointing at the `_estimate_mi` function.",

Since the implementation of `_estimate_mi` includes checks for boolean and array types for `discrete_features`, it is crucial to confirm these cases are being tested.
