The discrete_features parameter can be an array of indices or a boolean mask, and the current code checks it against the string 'auto', which may cause errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, it seems the function has not been tested with discrete_features not equal to 'auto'. To address this, we need to ensure this function handles discrete_features correctly and safely compares them. We should then determine if there are any tests that check the function when discrete_features is not 'auto'.",

This function currently checks if `discrete_features` is set to 'auto', but it needs to also manage cases where `discrete_features` is an array of indices or a boolean mask. The provided search results show the `_estimate_mi` function, which is directly related to the issue. The function includes logic to handle `discrete_features` as 'auto', a boolean, or as an array by converting it to a boolean mask. This implementation aligns with addressing the issue of comparing `discrete_features` to an array or a boolean mask in future versions of numpy. Additionally, the `_estimate_mi` function includes the logic to handle continuous and discrete features separately, providing a comprehensive approach to managing feature types. This makes the `_estimate_mi` function's implementation highly relevant to the reported issue. Furthermore, the search results include the `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` functions that call `_estimate_mi`, indicating that these functions will also be affected by any updates or fixes in `_estimate_mi`, making them relevant as well.",
