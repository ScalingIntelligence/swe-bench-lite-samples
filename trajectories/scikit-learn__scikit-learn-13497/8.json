Specifically, the current implementation checks if `discrete_features` is 'auto' but doesn't handle arrays or boolean masks comprehensively. This could lead to errors in future versions of numpy. The code provided includes the `_estimate_mi` function where the check for 'auto' exists, along with handling for boolean values of `discrete_features`. However, it lacks explicit handling for array input types for `discrete_features`, which could indeed cause issues. Moreover, since the function's logic relies on this check, ensuring the function works with non-'auto' discrete features is crucial for robustness. There is also a need to test the function with discrete features being an array or a boolean mask for thorough validation. The provided code does not show any instances of such testing. Given this context, the identified code span is relevant to address the reported issue as it contains the affected logic inside the `_estimate_mi` function.",
