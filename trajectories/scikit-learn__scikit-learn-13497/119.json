The search results show several functions and their implementations in 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py'. Notably, '_estimate_mi' contains the check for 'discrete_features == 'auto'' and proceeds to determine the 'discrete_mask' based on whether 'discrete_features' is a boolean or an array of indices/boolean mask. This directly addresses the issue by showing how 'discrete_features' is used to determine if features are discrete or continuous, which could lead to errors if not handled correctly. Additionally, the rest of the functions provide context on how mutual information is computed differently based on whether features are continuous or discrete. This context helps in understanding the broader functionality related to the reported issue, ensuring that the complete section of code needed to understand and resolve the issue is considered.",
