The function then further checks if `discrete_features` is a boolean or an array and processes it appropriately be it a mask or an array of indices. This comprehensive handling suggests that the function is well-equipped to handle both actual discrete features and the 'auto' setting. Therefore, based on the current implementation, it appears that all relevant code concerning `discrete_features` in relation to the reported issue is provided in the file context.
