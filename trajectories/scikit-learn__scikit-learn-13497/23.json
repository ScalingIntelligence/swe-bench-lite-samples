This part of the code directly addresses the concern raised in the reported issue. Additionally, the file includes the `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` functions, which call `_estimate_mi`, indicating that these functions could also be affected by the issue.

This could lead to errors in future versions of numpy and indicates that the function might not be adequately tested with discrete features not equal to 'auto'. The provided search results contain the full definition of the `_estimate_mi` function, which demonstrates how the function interprets and processes the `discrete_features` parameter. Specifically, the function converts `discrete_features` into a boolean mask based on its type, either directly when it's a boolean or by indexing when it's an array of indices. Despite the detailed definition, there's no explicit handling of the case where `discrete_features` is directly compared with 'auto', which could be problematic. The provided code spans are relevant to the issue as they directly pertain to the handling of `discrete_features` in the `_estimate_mi` function.
