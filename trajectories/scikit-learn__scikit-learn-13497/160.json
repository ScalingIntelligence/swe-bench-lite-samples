By examining the provided code spans, it's clear that the `_estimate_mi` function indeed performs this problematic comparison. Furthermore, the `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` functions both call `_estimate_mi`, suggesting that they may also be affected by this issue if not properly tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'.
