Additionally, it suggests that the function might not be tested with `discrete_features` set to anything other than 'auto'. Therefore, the search should focus on the `_estimate_mi` function and ensure that there is thorough testing for different types of `discrete_features`. Since the code snippet provided already identifies the `_estimate_mi` function, the next step is to look for any test cases that specifically handle `discrete_features` being an array or boolean mask.",

The main concern is that currently, the function only evaluates `discrete_features == 'auto'`, which does not account for array or boolean mask inputs and might lead to errors in future numpy versions. Also, ensuring that the function is tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto' would be beneficial for robustness. The search results indicate that `_estimate_mi` is in `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`, which contains the specific logic for estimating mutual information. It is crucial to correct the handling of `discrete_features` within this function to adapt to all possible inputs\u2014boolean mask, array of indices\u2014as mentioned in the issue. Furthermore, ensuring that the function works with tests where `discrete_features` might take values other than 'auto' (i.e., not mainly relying on the 'auto' setting) is important for proper validation. Additionally, while examining the relevant code spans, it's important to make sure that the logic for processing different `discrete_features` inputs (like whether a feature is discrete or not) is managed appropriately to avoid future errors.",
