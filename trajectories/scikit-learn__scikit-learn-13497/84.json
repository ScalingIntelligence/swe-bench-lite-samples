This line could lead to errors in future versions of numpy when comparing a string to an array. The current context and search results both point to the same file, `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`, and include the function `_estimate_mi`. This function contains the problematic line and the subsequent logic for handling different types of `discrete_features`. The search results provide the full implementation of `_estimate_mi`, which includes handling for when `discrete_features` is a boolean or an array of indices. This contextual information is sufficient to address the reported issue, as it demonstrates how different types of `discrete_features` are managed within the function. Additionally, the presence of tests for `discrete_features` other than 'auto' is not apparent from the provided context or search results, which aligns with the concern raised in the issue.",
