This can cause errors, especially with future versions of numpy. Additionally, the issue suggests that the function might not be tested with `discrete_features` set to values other than 'auto'. \n\nIn the provided search results from `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`, we can see the `_estimate_mi` function which contains the line in question: `if discrete_features == 'auto':`. This function also includes additional logic to handle different types of `discrete_features` (boolean, array of indices, or boolean mask), but the initial comparison suggests a potential risk if `discrete_features` is an array or boolean mask. Thus, this span of code is directly relevant to addressing the reported issue. Additionally, the functions `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` call `_estimate_mi`, indicating they are also part of the broader context of handling the parameters like `discrete_features`. These sections must be considered to ensure a comprehensive understanding and potential solutions to the issue.",
