Reviewing the search results, the `_estimate_mi` function is indeed found in the file `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`. The function checks the type of `discrete_features` and handles it accordingly, but the initial comparison needs adjustment to avoid future numpy errors. Additionally, there are sibling functions `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` that use `_estimate_mi`, indicating that all three spans are relevant to the issue. The code also confirms the concern that `_estimate_mi` might not be tested with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'.
