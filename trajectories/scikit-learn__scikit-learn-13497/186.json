This can lead to errors, especially in future versions of numpy. Additionally, it is noted that the function may not be tested with 'discrete_features' set to anything other than 'auto'. To address this, we need to modify the '_estimate_mi' function to handle 'discrete_features' appropriately, ensuring that it can manage arrays or boolean masks without causing a type mismatch. Additionally, we should consider how best to review or test this function to ensure it works correctly for all types of 'discrete_features'.",
