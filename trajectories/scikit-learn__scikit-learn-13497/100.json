This comparison is problematic because 'discrete_features' can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which will not match with 'auto' and could lead to errors in future numpy versions. To address this issue, it's necessary to identify the exact part of the code where 'discrete_features' is being handled and ensure that it can correctly manage different types of 'discrete_features' (i.e., 'auto', array of indices, or boolean mask). The search results show the '_estimate_mi' function in the 'sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py' file, which contains the problematic comparison and the subsequent handling of different types of 'discrete_features'. This function is critical to both 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' functions.
