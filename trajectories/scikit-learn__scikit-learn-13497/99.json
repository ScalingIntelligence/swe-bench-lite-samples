This parameter can be 'auto', an array of indices, or a boolean mask, but the current implementation only correctly handles 'auto' and boolean values. The issue specifically mentions that comparisons with an array will lead to errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, it highlights that the function has not been tested with discrete features not equal to 'auto'. Analyzing the provided code, it is clear that the function ``_estimate_mi`` indeed checks if ``discrete_features`` is 'auto' or a boolean, but does not accommodate for an array of indices or a boolean mask without being explicitly provided in boolean form. This suggests a potential bug and the need for more comprehensive testing.

From the provided search results, it is evident that the function `_estimate_mi` in `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` handles the 'auto' comparison and the conversion of discrete_features into a boolean mask. This function is already identified as relevant. Further, the new search results confirm the presence of this function and also show additional related functions such as `_compute_mi_cc`, `_compute_mi_cd`, `_compute_mi`, and `_iterate_columns`, all of which are directly related to the calculation and handling of mutual information based on the type of features. All these code spans align well with the reported issue, providing the necessary context for handling discrete features and their interaction with the continuous features and target variables. Additionally, other files such as `univariate_selection.py` and `rfe.py` are also found, which may not directly relate to the issue of handling 'auto' or testing with discrete features other than 'auto', thereby suggesting a comprehensive search for all relevant code spans.",
