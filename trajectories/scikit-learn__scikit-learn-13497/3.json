This discrepancy could lead to errors in future versions of numpy. Additionally, there's a concern that the function is not tested with `discrete_features != 'auto'. The provided search results and file context both include the `_estimate_mi` function. The function checks the type of `discrete_features`, converting it to a boolean mask if necessary. However, the code does not explicitly handle or test scenarios where `discrete_features` is not equal to 'auto'. The relevant code spans are identified within the `_estimate_mi` function section, particularly where `discrete_features` is processed and where the `continuous_mask` is determined. These sections are crucial as they directly address the concern about type checking and handling of `discrete_features`. The identified spans include the conditional checks and assignments related to `discrete_features`. Although there's an existing context from a previous search that includes the same function, the new search results confirm the importance of these code spans. This analysis ensures that the most relevant parts of the function are recognized, focusing on the handling of `discrete_features`.",
