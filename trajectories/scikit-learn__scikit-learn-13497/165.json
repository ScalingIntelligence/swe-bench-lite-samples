Specifically, the condition 'discrete_features == 'auto'' is used, but 'discrete_features' can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which could cause errors in future versions of numpy. Examining the provided code, it is clear that the '_estimate_mi' function indeed checks for the 'auto' string and converts this to a boolean mask based on matrix sparsity. The function then proceeds to handle the different types of 'discrete_features' correctly, converting non-boolean arrays into a mask and validating input types. However, there is a risk that future numpy versions might not handle the string comparison with arrays as gracefully. Additionally, there is the question of whether the function is tested with 'discrete_features' not equal to 'auto'. The code spans provided do not include test cases or calls to '_estimate_mi' with 'discrete_features' set to values other than 'auto', which is a concern for ensuring comprehensive testing of the function. Based on these observations, the relevant span to address the reported issue is the one containing '_estimate_mi' function. Other functions 'mutual_info_regression' and 'mutual_info_classif' both call '_estimate_mi', which suggests they might also be affected by the issue indirectly. More investigation into the test cases and actual usage of these functions might be necessary given the current search results.",
