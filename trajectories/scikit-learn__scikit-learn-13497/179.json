This directly corresponds to the code span identified by the id `_estimate_mi` in the `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` file. The logic inside this function handles the case where `discrete_features` is `'auto'`, a boolean, or an array. The function then correctly processes these inputs to decide which features are discrete or continuous. This confirms that the code is indeed relevant to the reported issue. The `discrete_features == 'auto'` check is present in the `_estimate_mi` function and the subsequent logic demonstrates how different types of `discrete_features` are handled, aligning well with the reported issue. Additionally, the function `mutual_info_regression` and `mutual_info_classif` which call `_estimate_mi` are also relevant as they use the same parameter `discrete_features`. This series of functions helps in understanding the flow and use of `discrete_features`, making the entire section relevant.",
