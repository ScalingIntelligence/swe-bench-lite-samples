This comparison can lead to errors because `discrete_features` can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask. The issue also highlights the lack of testing with `discrete_features` not equal to 'auto'. The provided search results include the `_estimate_mi` function which directly addresses the concern by handling the `discrete_features` parameter differently based on its type. This code handles cases where `discrete_features` is 'auto', a boolean, or an array. There is also a check to ensure that if any continuous features are detected in a sparse matrix, it raises an error, which is addressed in the reported issue. It does not appear that the function is tested with `discrete_features` being anything other than 'auto' as suggested by the reported issue. The analysis of the code spans indicates that the relevant code spans fixing the issue are the handling of `discrete_features` in the `_estimate_mi` function.",
