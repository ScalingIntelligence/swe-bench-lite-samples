  "initial_message": "Allow ValidationErrors to equal each other when created identically\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by kamni)\n\t \nCurrently ValidationErrors (django.core.exceptions.ValidationError) that have identical messages don't equal each other, which is counter-intuitive, and can make certain kinds of testing more complicated. Please add an __eq__ method that allows two ValidationErrors to be compared. \nIdeally, this would be more than just a simple self.messages == other.messages. It would be most helpful if the comparison were independent of the order in which errors were raised in a field or in non_field_errors.\n"
