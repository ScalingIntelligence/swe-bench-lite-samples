The relevant files already identified include several files like exceptions.py, validators.py, checks/messages.py, forms/utils.py, and others. To address the issue, we need to find the exact location of the ValidationError class and potentially related methods like __eq__ for comparison.\n\nGiven the context of the files already identified, it's apparent that the ValidationError class is located in django/core/exceptions.py. Examining this file should reveal where we can implement the __eq__ method. However, we should also look for any other occurrences of ValidationError that might influence how we implement the comparison, especially since order independence is important. We should also consider related classes or methods that perform similar comparisons in other files to draw inspiration on how to implement the __eq__ comparison for ValidationError.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue requires the addition of an __eq__ method to the ValidationError class in django.core.exceptions. This method should allow two ValidationErrors with identical messages to be considered equal, even if the messages were added in a different order. The context provides the existing implementation of the ValidationError class, including its __init__, message properties, and methods for updating and iterating over error messages. The search results included a different class, ErrorList, which already has an __eq__ method defined. However, this class is not directly relevant to the issue at hand since it pertains to a form utility and does not have the necessary context or functionality to address the problem with ValidationError. Based on the analysis, there is no relevant code in the search results directly addressing the reported issue. Therefore, the identified_spans field should be set to null to indicate that no relevant code spans have been found.",

An efficient way to achieve this would be to normalize these nested structures before comparison, ensuring order independence. This approach also opens up possibilities for leveraging existing comparison methods from other parts of Django, as previously suggested with ErrorList. Implementing a similar __eq__ method within ValidationError that makes use of methods for flattening and normalizing the error structures would address the issue without the need for external aids or additional utility functions. Steps could include creating a method that recursively flattens the error lists and dictionaries into a sorted, hashable structure, suitable for comparison. This would bridge the gap in Django's comparison tolerance for ValidationError, allowing for easier debugging, testing, and consistency checks in any application that uses these error types.",
