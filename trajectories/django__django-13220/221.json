However, the __eq__ method itself is not present.

Please add an __eq__ method that allows two ValidationErrors to be compared. \nIdeally, this would be more than just a simple self.messages == other.messages. It would be most helpful if the comparison were independent of the order in which errors were raised in a field or in non_field_errors.\n"
