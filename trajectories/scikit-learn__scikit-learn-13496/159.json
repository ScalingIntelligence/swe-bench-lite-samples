Currently, `warm_start` is inherited from the `BaseBagging` class but is not explicitly exposed in `IsolationForest`'s `__init__()` method. To resolve this, the `warm_start` parameter should be added to `IsolationForest.__init__()` and documented similarly to how it's done in `RandomForestClassifier`. Additionally, a test should be added to ensure proper functionality and it should be mentioned in the documentation example for `IsolationForest`. Given the context provided, it's clear that the main classes to focus on are `IsolationForest`, `BaseBagging`, and potentially `BaseForest` as it pertains to `RandomForestClassifier`.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue requires exposing the `warm_start` parameter in the `IsolationForest` class, which is currently inherited but not explicitly included in the class's parameters. The analysis began by inspecting the `IsolationForest` class in 'sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py', where it was observed that the `__init__` method does not include the `warm_start` parameter, even though it inherits from `BaseBagging` where `warm_start` is defined. This inheritance is evident from the line `class IsolationForest(BaseBagging, OutlierMixin):`. The subsequent spans in 'iforest.py' do not directly address the issue but rather define methods and properties that the `IsolationForest` instance uses. Following this, the analysis moved to 'sklearn/ensemble/bagging.py', where the `BaseBagging` class is defined. The `__init__` method for `BaseBagging` explicitly includes `warm_start` as a parameter, setting the stage for its use in `IsolationForest`. Monitoring file inputs has identified that no file carries the presence of 'mpv' or related functionality. The primary task is to expose and document the `warm_start` parameter in `IsolationForest`, which should align with the behavior documented in `BaseForest` or `RandomForestClassifier`. Considering these findings, it appears that the relevant code spans are in the `__init__` methods of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`, which decide where `warm_start` should be. Additionally, adjustments in documentation and testing to reflect the added parameter would be advisable. It is clear that the `warm_start` parameter in `BaseBagging` needs to be acknowledged within the `IsolationForest` class.",

  "initial_message": "Expose warm_start in Isolation forest\nIt seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.\r\n\r\nEven though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.\r\n\r\nTo make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:\r\n* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;\r\n* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:\r\n```py\r\n    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)\r\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\r\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\r\n        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n"
