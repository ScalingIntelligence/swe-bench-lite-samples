From the search results provided:\n\n1. The `IsolationForest` class definition in `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py` does not currently expose the `warm_start` parameter in its `__init__` method. This is where the parameter needs to be added for better user visibility and access.\n\n2. The `BaseBagging` class definition in `sklearn/ensemble/bagging.py` already includes the `warm_start` parameter in its `__init__` method, indicating that `IsolationForest` inherits this parameter. This is confirmed functionality that users can leverage by manually setting it after initialization.\n\n3. The `_fit` method in `BaseBagging` handles the logic for `warm_start`, managing the addition of new estimators when `warm_start` is set to `True`. This is an important part of the functionality that `IsolationForest` will inherit and use directly.\n\nBased on these observations, the task of exposing `warm_start` in `IsolationForest` can be achieved by modifying the `__init__` method of `IsolationForest` to include the `warm_start` parameter, aligned with the suggested changes from the issue report. Also, the implementation and functionality of `warm_start` in `BaseBagging` must be understood and possibly tested to ensure full compatibility and expected behavior when used in `IsolationForest`.\n\nBy adding `warm_start` to `IsolationForest.__init__`, documenting its behavior, and ensuring it is tested, the usability and clarity of this feature will improve, addressing the core issue as reported.",

  "initial_message": "Expose warm_start in Isolation forest\nIt seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.\r\n\r\nEven though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.\r\n\r\nTo make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:\r\n* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;\r\n* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:\r\n```py\r\n    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)\r\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\r\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\r\n        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n"
