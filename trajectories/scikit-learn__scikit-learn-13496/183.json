The primary focus is on the initialization of `IsolationForest` and its parent class `BaseBagging`. By examining the code, we can identify that `warm_start` is indeed inherited from `BaseBagging` but not explicitly exposed in `IsolationForest.__init__()`. The provided search results include the necessary code spans from `IsolationForest`, `BaseBagging`, and `RandomForestClassifier`. These spans reveal that `warm_start` is a parameter in `BaseBagging` and that `RandomForestClassifier` exposes it in its `__init__()` method. This strengthens the case for exposing `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()` to align with similar functionalities in other ensemble methods. Additionally, the code spans provide context for how `warm_start` operates in a related class, which is crucial for understanding its implementation and potential modifications. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue, and the search task can be considered complete with these findings.",

  "initial_message": "Expose warm_start in Isolation forest\nIt seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.\r\n\r\nEven though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.\r\n\r\nTo make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:\r\n* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;\r\n* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:\r\n```py\r\n    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)\r\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\r\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\r\n        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n"
