The search results provide two files, `bagging.py` and `iforest.py`. \n\nIn `bagging.py`, the `BaseBagging` class contains the `__init__` method where `warm_start` is defined. This is essential because `IsolationForest` inherits from `BaseBagging`, and the `warm_start` parameter is indeed inherited. However, `warm_start` is not listed in `IsolationForest.__init__`, which aligns with the issue's premise that it is not directly exposed. \n\nIn `iforest.py`, the `IsolationForest` class initializer does not include `warm_start`, even though it should be accessible due to inheritance. This omission is the core of the issue and suggests that modifying `IsolationForest.__init__` to include `warm_start` would be a necessary step to resolve the reported issue. \n\nThese observations confirm that the relevant code spans are in the `__init__` methods of `BaseBagging` and `IsolationForest`, where the `warm_start` parameter should be explicitly declared and documented.",

To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.\r\n\r\nTo make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:\r\n* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;\r\n* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:\r\n```py\r\n    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)\r\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\r\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\r\n        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n"
