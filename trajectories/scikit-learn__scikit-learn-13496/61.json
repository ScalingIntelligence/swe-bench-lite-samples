  "initial_message": "Expose warm_start in Isolation forest\nIt seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.\r\n\r\nEven though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.\r\n\r\nTo make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:\r\n* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;\r\n* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:\r\n```py\r\n    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)\r\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\r\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\r\n        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n"
