The error occurs during arithmetic operations with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, where an attempt to perform a bitwise operation between an integer and NoneType results in a TypeError. The relevant classes and mixins include NDDataRef, NDArithmeticMixin, and potentially NDData. The method of interest is `multiply` with the `handle_mask` parameter. Focusing on the NDArithmeticMixin and NDDataRef classes within the nddata module seems appropriate for locating the specific code related to mask handling and arithmetic operations.",

Specifically, the error occurs with the `bitwise_or` operation when attempting to operate on an integer and a NoneType. The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied to the output when one operand lacks a mask. The relevant code spans are identified primarily in the 'NDArithmeticMixin' class, which contains methods for arithmetic operations including '_arithmetic', '_arithmetic_data', '_arithmetic_uncertainty', '_arithmetic_mask', '_arithmetic_wcs', and '_arithmetic_meta'. These methods handle various aspects of arithmetic operations including mask handling. The 'NDDataRef' class, which inherits from 'NDArithmeticMixin', is also relevant as it uses these methods. By examining the '_arithmetic_mask' method, we can see how the mask handling is defined, which directly relates to the reported issue. Thus, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and addressing the mask propagation problem.",

The method `_arithmetic` and its associated helper methods like `_arithmetic_mask` are key to understanding how mask propagation is handled during arithmetic operations.

The primary concern is that the `np.bitwise_or` operation fails due to one operand being a NoneType, which was not an issue in the previous version (v5.2). The expected behavior is for the mask to be copied over to the output when one operand lacks a mask. The key elements to look for in the code are functions and methods related to arithmetic operations involving masks, specifically where mask handling is defined and implemented. The provided search results contain relevant code spans in `ndarithmetic.py` that deal with arithmetic operations, mask handling, and the NDArithmeticMixin class, which is likely central to solving the issue. The identified code spans within `ndarithmetic.py` include the `_arithmetic` method, which orchestrates arithmetic operations and mask handling, and the `_arithmetic_mask` method, which specifically deals with calculating the resulting mask. These methods are crucial as they directly relate to the mask propagation behavior described in the issue. Notably, the `_arithmetic_mask` method checks for the presence of masks in operands and handles them accordingly, which is directly relevant to the reported problem.

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
