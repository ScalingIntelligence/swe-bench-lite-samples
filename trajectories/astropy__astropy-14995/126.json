The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied to the output when one operand lacks a mask, akin to the behavior in version 5.2. The provided search results focus on the NDArithmeticMixin class within astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py. This class contains methods relevant to arithmetic operations involving NDData objects, such as _arithmetic, _arithmetic_mask, and multiply. The _arithmetic method handles various aspects of arithmetic operations including mask handling, while _arithmetic_mask specifically deals with mask calculations during arithmetic operations. The multiply method, as expected, defines multiplication operations. The method _arithmetic_mask appears particularly relevant as it directly deals with mask calculation during arithmetic operations. It checks if masks are present and combines them using the specified handle_mask function. Given the issue's description, this method is a likely location where the TypeError could be originating due to the handling of NoneType masks. Given this analysis, the relevant code spans involve the _arithmetic method for its comprehensive handling of arithmetic operations and the specific _arithmetic_mask method due to its role in mask handling.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
