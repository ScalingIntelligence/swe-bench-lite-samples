The provided search results contain the `astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py` file, which defines the `NDDataRef` class. This class inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, `NDIOMixin`, and `NDSlicingMixin`, and indirectly from `NDData`. Given the nature of the issue, it is likely that the implementation of mask handling during arithmetic operations is located within the `NDArithmeticMixin` mixin. While the `NDDataRef` class itself does not contain any methods or attributes, the issue points directly to the arithmetic operations and mask handling in this class and its inherited mixins. Therefore, the relevant code spans are likely within the `NDArithmeticMixin` mixin or the `NDData` base class. Since the exact location in the code where the mask handling fails is not provided, I will mark this search as incomplete but relevant, indicating the need for further inspection of the `NDArithmeticMixin` mixin to identify the specific areas dealing with mask handling during arithmetic operations.",

This is evident in the _arithmetic_mask method, where the mask of the operand is directly used without checking if it is None. The _arithmetic method also directly uses np.bitwise_or to handle masks without considering the possibility of a None mask.\n\nTo address this issue, the relevant code spans to be reviewed and potentially modified are:\n1. The _arithmetic_mask method where the mask of the operand is processed.\n2. The _arithmetic method where the handle_mask parameter is used to process the mask.\n\nThese code spans need to be inspected to ensure that mask propagation handles the scenario where one of the masks is None, potentially by introducing a check for None and handling it appropriately (e.g., by setting None masks to an array of False or by ensuring that operations like bitwise_or are not attempted with None values).",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
