To address the issue, the handling of masks during arithmetic operations should be adjusted to ensure that None masks are treated properly to avoid TypeErrors. Specifically, the method should ensure that when `np.bitwise_or` is used, it does not attempt to operate on a NoneType mask. Adjustments may include converting None masks to a suitable representation (like an array of zeros or False) before applying `np.bitwise_or`.",

This issue was not present in version 5.2.\n\nIn the given context and search results, we see that the relevant file is `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` and within it, the class `NDArithmeticMixin` holds the main logic for arithmetic operations along with mask handling.\n\nThe function `_arithmetic_mask` within `NDArithmeticMixin` is responsible for handling the masks during arithmetic. This function checks if the mask of either operand is `None` and then handles it accordingly. Specifically, it copies the mask of the other operand when one is missing, and in the case where neither operand has a mask, it returns `None`.\n\nThe relevant part of the code that needs inspection is the handling of the `np.bitwise_or` operation in this function. The code seems to try to handle cases where an operand could have a `None` mask, but the current logic might not be correctly handling the scenario where an integer (`self.mask`) is being operated upon with a `None` type (`operand.mask`).\n\nGiven the limited context provided, the search results align well with the problem description, suggesting that the issue likely lies within the logic of `_arithmetic_mask` when dealing with the `np.bitwise_or`.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
