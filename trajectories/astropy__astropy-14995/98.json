This behavior is observed in version 5.3, whereas it did not occur in version 5.2. The error is triggered during the `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` operation, specifically when trying to perform a bitwise OR between an integer and a NoneType. The expected behavior is that when one operand does not have a mask, the existing mask should be copied over to the output. The provided code spans from `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` seem to be relevant as they contain methods for arithmetic operations and mask handling in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class. Notably, the `_arithmetic` method defines the behavior for handling masks during arithmetic operations, which is crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue. Additionally, the `_arithmetic_mask` method deals specifically with the calculation of the resulting mask during these operations. The `multiply` method, which is likely used in the reproduction steps, is also provided, linking directly to the arithmetic operations being discussed. These code spans are likely to contain the necessary code to understand and fix the mask propagation issue.",

The `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` method is responsible for handling mask operations during arithmetic operations. It checks if either operand's mask is None and then decides how to proceed, including copying the mask from the operand that has one if the other does not.\n\n2. The `NDArithmeticMixin.multiply` method is specifically noted for causing the issue when one operand lacks a mask, indicating that the issue lies within how masks are handled specifically during multiplication operations.\n\nIt appears that the identified `_arithmetic_mask` method needs to be reviewed and possibly adjusted to handle cases where one operand does not have a mask without causing a TypeError due to an attempt to perform bitwise operations on a mask that includes None values. This aligns with the expectation that the method should be robust enough to handle missing masks without throwing errors and should implement the expected behavior of copying over the existing mask in such cases.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n"
