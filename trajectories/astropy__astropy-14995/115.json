The error occurs during the bitwise operation between an integer mask and a NoneType mask. The expected behavior is for the mask to be copied over or handled as it was in v5.2.\n\nThe relevant code spans are identified in `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`, particularly in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class. The methods `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and `_arithmetic_data` are relevant because they handle the arithmetic operations, mask handling, and data operations respectively. Additionally, the methods `multiply`, `add`, `subtract`, and `divide` are identified as they directly perform the arithmetic operations where the mask issue could occur.\n\nThe identified code spans show how the mask is handled during arithmetic operations. The method `_arithmetic_mask` specifically deals with mask propagation and is likely where the issue is occurring. By examining this method, it can be seen how the masks are processed and combined using `handle_mask` (which can be `np.bitwise_or`). The condition checks if either operand has a mask and how the result mask is computed. The presence of `None` masks is not explicitly handled, which could lead to the TypeError mentioned in the issue.\n\nThis analysis provides a clear basis for further investigation and possible fixes in the code to handle NoneType masks appropriately to avoid the TypeError during operations involving masks.",

The expected behavior is that when one operand does not have a mask, the existing mask should be copied over to the output, similar to how it worked in version 5.2. The provided search results include relevant sections of code from the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, which includes methods for handling arithmetic operations, including mask handling. Specifically, the `_arithmetic_mask` method is relevant as it defines how masks are combined during arithmetic operations. This method checks if either operand has a `None` mask and handles it accordingly, which seems to be where the issue lies. Following the detailed analysis of the code spans, I have identified that the `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` span is relevant as it directly relates to the mask handling during arithmetic operations. This span should be included for further investigation and potential fixes concerning the reported issue. Based on this, the provided search results are sufficient to build a picture of mask propagation failure in version 5.3 and give insights into the necessary changes, but further code examination may still be required to fully resolve the issue.",

This oversight is critical and must be addressed to ensure that arithmetic operations can proceed smoothly even when one operand does not have a mask.

From the provided search results and the context, it is clear that the function `_arithmetic_mask` in `NDArithmeticMixin` is responsible for handling the mask during arithmetic operations. The function checks if either the mask is `None` for both operands or if `handle_mask` is `None`. If so, it returns `None`. If only one operand has a mask, it deep copies that mask. However, the function does not handle the case where `handle_mask` is a bitwise operation like `np.bitwise_or` and one of the masks is `None`, which could be causing the error.
