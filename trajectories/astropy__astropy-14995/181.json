The TypeError arises when attempting to perform bitwise operations between an integer and a NoneType, suggesting that the operand without a mask is being treated as a mask of None, which is causing the failure. The expected behavior is that when one operand lacks a mask, the existing mask should be propagated to the output, mirroring the behavior in version 5.2 where this problem did not occur. To address the issue, the relevant code spans should be closely examined to determine where and how the mask propagation logic is implemented, especially focusing on the _arithmetic method that handles arithmetic operations and the _arithmetic_mask method that specifically deals with mask handling during arithmetic operations. The search results include the NDArithmeticMixin class which contains the _arithmetic and _arithmetic_mask methods among others. These methods are highly relevant as they directly deal with the handling of masks during arithmetic operations, making them the most likely location to find the code responsible for the issue discussed.",

The expected behavior is that the mask should be handled such that operations proceed without error, potentially by copying the existing mask to the output if one operand lacks a mask. The current implementation in `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` does not account for operations involving `None` masks, leading to type errors when `np.bitwise_or` is used. The search results primarily focus on the `Masked` class, which is likely related to handling masked arrays but is not directly addressing the mask propagation issue in arithmetic operations in `NDArithmeticMixin`.",
