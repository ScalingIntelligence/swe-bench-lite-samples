This leads to a TypeError when using `np.bitwise_or` to handle the mask. The issue is evident in v5.3 but not in v5.2. The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output when an operand lacks a mask. In examining the provided search results, the most relevant code is found within the 'NDArithmeticMixin' class. This class contains methods for handling arithmetic operations including '_arithmetic_mask', which is directly involved in managing mask propagation during arithmetic operations. The method '_arithmetic_mask' should handle cases where one operand has a mask and the other does not, but it currently does not adequately manage the case where a mask is None and the operation is a bitwise_or, leading to the reported error. Therefore, this method and the general logic within '_arithmetic' need careful review and potential adjustments to align with the expected behavior described in the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about mask propagation failing during arithmetic operations when one of the operands does not have a mask in version 5.3 of Astropy, whereas it works fine in version 5.2. The issue suggests that the operand without a mask is treated as a mask of None, leading to a TypeError when performing bitwise operations. The goal is for the mask to be copied over to the output or handled similarly to how it was handled in version 5.2.\n\nFrom the current context, we have the `NDArithmeticMixin` class which includes the `_arithmetic` method where mask handling occurs. The `_arithmetic_mask` method also deals with mask handling and is relevant as it checks the masks of both operands and applies the `handle_mask` operation.\n\nIn the new search results, the `NDArithmeticMixin` class is further explored with additional methods such as `_arithmetic_data`, `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. The `multiply` method, in particular, is directly related to the reported issue as it performs multiplication operations, which is one of the scenarios where the mask propagation fails. Additionally, the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method initializes operands to ensure the correct arithmetic operation is called, which is relevant for the broader context of handling these operations.\n\nBased on the discussion, the relevant spans include `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask`, `NDArithmeticMixin.multiply`, and `NDArithmeticMixin._prepare_then_do_arithmetic`. These span IDs are chosen because they directly involve mask handling and performing arithmetic operations, addressing the core of the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
