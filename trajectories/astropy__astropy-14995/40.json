Upon reviewing the provided code, it is evident that the `NDArithmeticMixin` class is responsible for arithmetic operations on `NDDataRef` objects and includes a method `_arithmetic_mask` which handles mask propagation. The issue likely arises in this method, where it fails to properly handle the case where one operand's mask is `None`. Specifically, the method does not account for the case where one mask may be `None` and attempts to apply a bitwise operation, leading to a TypeError. The relevant spans of code are identified where the mask handling logic resides, specifically in `_arithmetic_mask`, which needs to be updated to handle `None` masks appropriately. This method checks and manages the masks of the two operands and applies the provided `handle_mask` function (default `np.logical_or`) to them. The existing logic does not handle `None` masks gracefully, which causes the error described in the issue.",

This results in a TypeError due to an attempt to perform a bitwise OR operation between an integer and a NoneType. The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over if one operand lacks a mask, similar to the behavior in v5.2. In the provided search results, two key sections are relevant: 1) The 'NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic' method, which handles the arithmetic operations including the propagation of masks. The use of 'handle_mask=np.logical_or' implies that it is responsible for how masks are combined. The method checks for the presence of masks and decides whether to apply the operation or not. 2) The 'NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask' method specifically deals with the calculation of the resulting mask. It currently does not handle the case where one mask is None, which leads to the error when 'np.bitwise_or' is used. Addressing the issue likely involves modifying this method to return a mask that avoids None values when combining masks. Confirming the exact fix requires further inspection of how these masks are used and ensuring that any new behavior aligns with the expected functionality without a mask in v5.2.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
