This problem manifests during arithmetic operations, specifically when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. The error occurs because an attempt is made to perform a bitwise OR operation between an integer and `None`, which is not supported. The expected behavior is that when one operand lacks a mask, the existing mask should be copied or handled in a manner similar to v5.2, where no issues occurred. The provided search results include the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, which is likely relevant to the issue as it contains methods for arithmetic operations on `NDDataRef` objects. Notably, the `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask` methods are particularly pertinent. The `_arithmetic` method is responsible for handling arithmetic operations and includes logic for handling masks, including an `if` statement that handles cases where either operand might not have a mask. The `_arithmetic_mask` method is also crucial, as it specifically deals with calculating the resulting mask after an arithmetic operation. These methods are likely where the issue lies, especially given the context of mask handling and the bitwise OR operation.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
