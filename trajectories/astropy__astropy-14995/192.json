The search results provide the implementation of the '_prepare_then_do_arithmetic' method in the 'NDArithmeticMixin' class, which is central to handling arithmetic operations. This method handles the conversion of operands, their promotion to the appropriate class, and the subsequent arithmetic operation. By reviewing this method, we can identify the specific span of code responsible for the mask handling and potentially the cause of the issue. The method involves handling masks through the '_arithmetic' method, which is likely where the mask propagation logic resides. Further, the provided 'multiply' method in the context indicates that it leverages this '_prepare_then_do_arithmetic' method for its functionality, aligning with the issue's focus on multiplication operations.

The issue specifically points out that the mask propagation fails when using the bitwise_or operation on an integer and a NoneType, which is not the case in v5.2. Given this context, I then reviewed the provided file context and search results to find code spans that deal with mask handling and arithmetic operations involving NDDataRef objects. In the file context, 'NDArithmeticMixin.multiply' and '_prepare_then_do_arithmetic' methods were identified as potentially relevant since they involve arithmetic operations and operand handling. In the search results, the '_arithmetic' method was analyzed in detail as it contains logic for performing arithmetic operations and handling masks. This method includes handling for 'propagate_uncertainties', 'handle_mask', and 'operation_ignores_mask' which are directly related to the reported issue. Based on this analysis, the '_arithmetic' method in the search results is identified as highly relevant as it directly addresses the mask handling during arithmetic operations.",
