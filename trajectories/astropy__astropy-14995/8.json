The error occurs when using `np.bitwise_or` as the `handle_mask` method, and it tries to operate on an integer and a None. The expected behavior is that the mask should be propagated without errors, possibly by copying over the mask that exists from one operand to the result if the other operand does not have a mask. This functionality was working fine in the previous version (v5.2), indicating a potential regression in v5.3.\n\nThe search results provide a relevant code span from `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`, specifically the `multiply` method within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class. This method is likely where the arithmetic operation causing the issue is defined. By examining this code span, we can see that it uses `np.multiply` for the arithmetic operation and includes parameters that might be related to mask handling, potentially such as `handle_mask`. This span is crucial for identifying where the mask handling might be going wrong, as suggested by the issue. It should be further examined to ensure mask propagation handles cases where one operand has no mask appropriately.",

This is causing a TypeError because the operation attempts to perform a bitwise OR between an integer and a NoneType mask. To resolve this, the relevant code spans need to ensure that when a mask is None, it doesn't cause the operation to fail but instead handles it gracefully, possibly by copying over the existing mask to the output. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals several key methods in the NDArithmeticMixin class that handle arithmetic operations and mask propagation. Notably, the `multiply` method is defined, which calls `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`. The `_arithmetic` method is responsible for carrying out arithmetic operations and managing various aspects including mask handling. The `_arithmetic_mask` method specifically deals with mask propagation and should be investigated to ensure it correctly handles the case where one of the masks is None. The identified spans are relevant as they directly address the areas where the mask handling logic resides and can be modified to fix the issue.",
