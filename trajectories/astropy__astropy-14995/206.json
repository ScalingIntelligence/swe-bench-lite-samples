This leads to a TypeError when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. The expected behavior is that the mask should be copied over or handled in a way that it did in version 5.2. Given this, the relevant sections of code from the search results are those that handle arithmetic operations involving masks, especially where the mask handling logic resides. Specifically, the `NDArithmeticMixin` class contains methods that manage arithmetic operations and mask handling, such as `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and `multiply`. These methods are crucial for identifying and potentially fixing the issue regarding mask propagation failure when one operand lacks a mask.",

The `_arithmetic` method specifically deals with mask propagation through the `handle_mask` parameter. The method `_arithmetic_mask` is responsible for determining the resulting mask based on the operation and the masks of the operands. The `multiply` method is implemented to use these underlying functionalities. Given the detailed implementation of mask handling and the presence of the `multiply` method that interacts with `handle_mask`, it can be concluded that all relevant code for addressing the reported issue is present in the file context. This includes the ability to handle cases where one operand lacks a mask and the necessity to manage such cases to avoidTypeError during operations like bitwise_or.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans from the `_arithmetic` method down to the specific arithmetic operations like `multiply`. The current implementation provides a solid base for addressing the issue reported by ensuring correct mask propagation and handling in arithmetic operations, especially concerning the interaction between masks and operands.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
