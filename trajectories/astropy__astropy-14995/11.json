The specific concern is that `np.bitwise_or` fails when operating on an integer and a NoneType due to an operand lacking a mask. The relevant code spans in the provided search results are primarily in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, specifically the `_arithmetic` method, which orchestrates the arithmetic operations, including how masks are handled, using the `handle_mask` parameter, which defaults to `np.logical_or`. This is directly related to the mask propagation issue because it shows how masks are combined, potentially leading to the error when one mask is None. Also relevant is the `_arithmetic_mask` method, which directly deals with the mask during arithmetic operations. It checks if the masks of operands are `None` and how they should be handled. This is critical because if one operand lacks a mask, it should be treated appropriately to avoid TypeError during operations like `np.bitwise_or`. Lastly, the `multiply` method, as an example of an arithmetic operation, encapsulates its behavior when handling masks in the broader context defined by `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask`. These code spans are relevant because they directly address mask handling, which is central to the reported issue. They show how masks are prepared and combined during arithmetic operations, illustrating the potential point of failure when an operand does not have a mask. Understanding these spans is crucial for diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue related to mask propagation in arithmetic operations. Based on the analysis of these spans, it's clear that the code relevant to the reported issue is fully represented in the search results, indicating that the search task for finding relevant code related to mask handling in arithmetic operations can be considered complete.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
