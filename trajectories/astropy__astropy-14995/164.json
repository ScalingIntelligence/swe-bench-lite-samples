The core problem seems to be the handling of masks during arithmetic operations, specifically where `np.bitwise_or` is used to combine masks. The error occurs when `np.bitwise_or` tries to operate on an integer and a `NoneType`, indicating that there's a need to handle cases where one of the masks is `None`. The provided search results include relevant code spans in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, specifically the `_arithmetic_mask` method which deals with the handling of masks during arithmetic operations. This method provides logic to handle cases where the mask might be `None`, and it's likely where the fix needs to be applied. The issue could potentially be resolved by ensuring that `None` masks are treated appropriately, perhaps by converting them to actual masks (e.g., an array of False) before applying bitwise operations. The `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method is also relevant as it prepares operands for arithmetic operations and is involved in the process leading to the mask handling.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
