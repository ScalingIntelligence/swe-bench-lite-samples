Additionally, the check involving `handle_mask in ['ff', 'first_found']` seems crucial for determining how the mask is propagated when one operand lacks a mask.

The issue is traced down to `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic` method in the provided context and code areas provided under the key <search_results>. In these code contexts, I am going to look one more time very accurately if there is any addition that indicates that there is a problem dealing with `NoneType` masks.  First, I will check the occurrence of None type for masks in all code content.\n\nDuring my assessment of the code, I noticed that the method `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic` handles several aspects of arithmetic operations including mask handling but it does not explicitly check for `None` masks before operating with them, nor does it treat differently an operation with a mask and without a mask. There may be a need to implement a mask processing function that would harmonize a result without mask (considering it 'NoneMask') with masked results that associates masking '0' to the 'NoneMasks' in operations we are looking for.  This could possibly fix the error with code using bitwise operations.\n\nNow, in the search results I've found other module - utils/masked/core.py at class `Masked` containing method `__new__`,  I'll check there too if `None` masks, when dealing with such operations, get anew in form that could facilitate treatment when conducted behind bitwise operations.

This method handles arithmetic operations on NDData objects, including the handling of masks during these operations. The code checks if the operation involves masked values and uses the `astropy.utils.masked.Masked` module if needed. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where one operand has a mask and the other does not. This could be the source of the issue reported, where a binary operation involving a NoneType mask and an integer mask results in an error. To resolve this, we need to look deeper into the `Masked` class and how it handles arithmetic operations where one operand might be NoneType.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
