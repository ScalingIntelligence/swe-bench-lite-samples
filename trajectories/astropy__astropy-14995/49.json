The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be propagated, as it was in previous versions. To address this, examining the `NDArithmeticMixin` class is critical as it contains methods for arithmetic operations including `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and `multiply`, which are key to understanding how mask handling is implemented.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the `NDArithmeticMixin` class directly is involved in handling arithmetic operations and mask propagation. The `_arithmetic` method sets up the conditions for arithmetic operations and handles the mask based on the `handle_mask` parameter. The `_arithmetic_mask` method is critical for determining the result mask during operations between objects with or without mask. The `multiply` method, which is decorated with sharedmethod, prepares the data for multiplication operations and utilizes the `_arithmetic` method ultimately.\n\nGiven the context of the issue and the search results, the relevant code spans are those dealing directly with mask handling in arithmetic operations. In particular, the `_arithmetic` method where mask handling logic is broadly set up and the `_arithmetic_mask` method which more specifically deals with computing the resultant mask based on the operand masks. These are both encapsulated in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, suggesting that any bug or oversight causing the failure of mask propagation might be situated in these areas of code.",

The method checks if either operand has a mask and applies the provided handle_mask operation (like np.bitwise_or). However, the method only handles the case where both operands have masks or one operand is None. It does not explicitly handle the case where one operand has a mask and the other does not, which is the core issue reported. This suggests that the relevant code that needs to be fixed or extended to handle this case is indeed present in the file context. Further, the '_arithmetic_mask' method is used within the '_arithmetic' method, supporting the idea that this segment of the code is relevant to the reported issue. The 'multiply' method, which is also included, also confirms that the arithmetic operations are being handled here.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
