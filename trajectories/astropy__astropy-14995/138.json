The error is a 'TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'' during operations using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. This indicates that during mask handling, a bitwise OR operation is attempted between an integer and a NoneType, which is not allowed. This problem did not occur in v5.2. Since the issue is related to mask handling in arithmetic operations, focusing on the NDArithmeticMixin class and its associated methods, particularly those dealing with mask propagation like `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask`, would be appropriate.",

This results in a TypeError due to an attempt to perform a bitwise operation between an integer and a NoneType. To address this, it's crucial to identify the relevant parts of the code responsible for handling masks during arithmetic operations. The provided search results include the `NDArithmeticMixin` class from `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`, which contains methods specifically designed for arithmetic operations on NDData objects, including handling masks. The `_arithmetic` method sets up the parameters and calls other methods to handle data, masks, and metadata during arithmetic. The `_arithmetic_mask` method, in particular, is responsible for calculating the resulting mask based on the operation and the operand's mask. This method seems to be where the logic for handling a mask being None should be implemented to prevent the TypeError. Therefore, these methods are highly relevant to resolving the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
