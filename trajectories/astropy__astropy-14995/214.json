This behavior is not observed in the previous version, indicating a regression that needs investigation. The provided search results offer insights into the classes and methods involved in arithmetic operations within astropy's NDData module. The NDArithmeticMixin class in 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' is likely central to the arithmetic operations, considering its name and context. Additionally, the '_arithmetic' decorator in 'astropy/nddata/ccddata.py' wraps operations and handles preparation before performing arithmetic, suggesting it might be involved in the issue. Identifying the exact method or code span responsible for handling masks during arithmetic operations within these classes could lead to the solution. It is crucial to inspect these methods to understand how mask handling differs between versions and to determine if modifications are required to ensure backward compatibility and correct mask propagation. Since the issue is specific to v5.3, a detailed comparison with v5.2's implementation and changes between versions could provide further clues.",

The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output if one operand does not have a mask.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class in `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`. The critical methods identified are `_arithmetic_mask` and `_arithmetic`, which handle mask operations and the overall arithmetic operations, respectively. These methods are responsible for the behavior described in the issue. The relevant code spans include the logic for handling masks, which currently does not account for the case where an operand's mask might be None. Specifically, it's important to ensure that when a mask is `None`, it does not cause the operation to fail. This indicates that the mask handling logic needs to be updated to appropriately handle `None` masks and avoid the TypeError.\n\nThe identified code spans are sufficient to address the issue by modifying the mask handling logic to ensure compatibility with operands that may lack a mask.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n"
