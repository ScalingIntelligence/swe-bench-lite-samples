This is not the case in version 5.2. The expected behavior is that if one operand does not have a mask, the existing mask should be copied over to the output or the operation should handle the absence of a mask without errors, as it did in version 5.2. The provided search results include the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, which contains methods for arithmetic operations on `NDDataRef` objects, including `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and `multiply`. These methods are critical for handling the mask during arithmetic operations. Specifically, the `_arithmetic` method handles the mask propagation based on the `handle_mask` parameter. The `_arithmetic_mask` method is responsible for combining masks during arithmetic operations, and `multiply` is the method that performs the multiplication operation. These methods are directly relevant to the reported issue as they deal with handling masks during arithmetic operations. Therefore, the search results provide the necessary context to understand and potentially fix the mask propagation issue.",

The key point is that the `np.bitwise_or` operation fails when trying to operate on an integer and a NoneType. This suggests that the handling of masks in arithmetic operations needs to be adjusted to account for operands without masks. The relevant code spans identified in the search results and the current context focus on the methods handling arithmetic operations and mask propagation, specifically `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic`, `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask`, and `NDArithmeticMixin.multiply`. These methods are central to how arithmetic operations are performed and how masks are handled during these operations. The current implementation in `_arithmetic_mask` does not explicitly handle the case where one of the masks could be None, which leads to the TypeError. To resolve the issue, the logic in `_arithmetic_mask` should be updated to handle NoneType masks appropriately, possibly by treating them as zeros or ensuring that the operation can safely proceed without encountering NoneType. Additionally, the `_arithmetic` method should ensure that the mask handling logic is correctly implemented for all types of operations.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
