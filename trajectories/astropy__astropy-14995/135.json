Specifically, the error occurs when performing operations with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` and one of the operands does not have a mask. The error message 'TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'' suggests that the operation is trying to apply bitwise OR between an integer and a NoneType object, which is not allowed. To address this, we need to locate the code handling mask propagation in arithmetic operations within NDDataRef and ensure proper handling of cases where one operand's mask is None.",

This leads to a TypeError when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. The expected behavior is that the mask from the operand with a mask should be copied to the output when the other operand lacks a mask. This issue appears to be specific to version 5.3 and is not present in version 5.2.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided code spans, the most relevant spans appear to be those in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, particularly those related to mask handling (e.g., `_arithmetic_mask`, `multiply`, `_arithmetic`). The `_arithmetic_mask` method specifically concerns mask propagation and should be thoroughly examined to understand why it fails under the specified conditions.\n\nThe `NDDataRef` class, being a subclass of `NDArithmeticMixin`, is also directly relevant, as it integrates the arithmetic functionality into the NDDataRef class. The `_arithmetic_mask` method within `NDArithmeticMixin` likely needs adjustments to manage cases where one operand has a mask and the other does not, ensuring that the resulting mask is appropriately handled.\n\nThe presence of the `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'` suggests that the code is attempting an operation between an integer mask and a `NoneType`, which indicates that the logic for handling operands without masks might be insufficient. Therefore, the identified code spans should be scrutinized for improvements to handle such scenarios effectively.",

The expected behavior is for the mask to be copied over if one of the operands does not have a mask, similar to how it worked in version 5.2. From the provided context and search results, it is clear that the core functionality for arithmetic operations and mask handling lies within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class in `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`. Specifically, the function `_arithmetic_mask` is responsible for handling the mask during arithmetic operations. The function checks if either operand lacks a mask and, depending on the condition, decides how to propagate the mask. The issue described in the report likely stems from the way `_arithmetic_mask` handles the scenario where one operand has `None` for the mask, particularly with the `np.bitwise_or` operation. The relevant code spans include not just `_arithmetic_mask` but also `_arithmetic` and the specific arithmetic methods (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) that call `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`. These spans are crucial for understanding how arithmetic operations are initiated and how masks are subsequently handled.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
