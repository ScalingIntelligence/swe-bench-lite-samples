The search results provide relevant information within the `NDData` class, specifically in the `__init__` method, which initializes the class instance and handles the mask property. This code span is crucial for understanding how masks are initialized and managed within the NDData class. There is no direct mention of arithmetic operations or mask propagation in the provided code. However, the initialization method is relevant to the issue as it sets up the object that might later be involved in arithmetic operations with mask handling.

The file `astropy/nddata/nddata.py` contains the `NDData` class initialization which handles the assignment of masks to the `NDData` objects. The mask is handled in the `__init__` method where it checks if the mask is provided or if it needs to be overwritten. The secondary file `astropy/utils/masked/core.py` contains the `Masked` class and its method `_set_mask` which sets the mask for the `Masked` objects.

The primary concern is the TypeError involving 'int' and 'NoneType' during np.bitwise_or operation when a mask is absent in one operand. The expected behavior is that if one operand does not have a mask, the existing mask should be propagated or copied over. The provided code spans reveal critical information about the NDDataRef class and its arithmetic operations, specifically the `multiply` method. However, the exact location where the mask propagation is failing is not directly evident in the spans provided. To address this issue effectively, it would be crucial to inspect the _prepare_then_do_arithmetic method or any underlying methods it calls (not provided in the spans) that handle the combination of masks during arithmetic operations. This could involve checking how masks are initialized or propagated in the presence of a 'None' mask and ensuring that the bitwise operations handle such cases without raising TypeErrors. Given the provided spans, it appears that the 'multiply' method of NDArithmeticMixin is the starting point for the mask propagation issue but lacks the detailed logic within the _prepare_then_do_arithmetic method or its deeper implementations. More detailed spans that cover the mask handling inside these methods are needed to fully address the issue. Existing spans are relevant but incomplete for resolving the issue.",

This problem is not present in version 5.2. The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output when one operand lacks a mask. The relevant search results include code spans from `astropy/nddata/nddata.py`, `astropy/utils/masked/core.py`, and `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`. These spans cover the initialization of NDData, handling of masks in Masked objects, and the arithmetic operations in NDArithmeticMixin, particularly the `multiply` method. These sections are crucial for understanding how masks are managed and how arithmetic operations involving NDData objects are performed. The identified spans directly address the issue by providing the necessary context for mask handling and arithmetic operations.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
