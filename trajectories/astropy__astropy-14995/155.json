This issue is causing a TypeError due to the attempted operation of bitwise_or between an integer and NoneType. To address this, the relevant code spans should be identified where the mask handling occurs during arithmetic operations. The NDArithmeticMixin class in 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' contains several methods that handle different aspects of arithmetic operations, including mask handling. The '_arithmetic_mask' method appears to be the most relevant, as it directly deals with the mask during arithmetic operations. This method checks for the presence of masks in both operands and handles the mask propagation as per the specified handle_mask function, which in the reported issue is np.bitwise_or. By examining this method, it can be determined how the mask is propagated when one operand lacks a mask and ensure that this propagation does not lead to a TypeError. Additionally, the '_arithmetic' method initializes the kwargs for the operation including handle_mask, indicating its comprehensive use across the class for mask handling.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
