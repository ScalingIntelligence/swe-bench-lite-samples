This suggests that the system is trying to perform a bitwise operation between an integer and a NoneType, which indicates a lack of handling for missing masks. To investigate this, it's necessary to look into the classes and methods handling NDData arithmetic and mask handling, particularly those related to the `bitwise_or` operation and mask propagation.

Thus, I identify the relevant files and code spans needed to understand and potentially address the reported issue concerning mask propagation.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
