The problem triggers a TypeError due to an attempted bitwise OR operation between an integer and None. To address this, we need to focus on the handling of masks in arithmetic operations within the NDArithmeticMixin class. \n\nThe NDArithmeticMixin class contains several methods relevant to arithmetic operations, including _arithmetic, _arithmetic_mask, and others like add, subtract, multiply, and divide, which invoke _prepare_then_do_arithmetic. These methods involve calculations and logic for propagating masks. \n\nThe _arithmetic method is particularly pertinent as it directly handles the mask propagation logic. It uses the handle_mask parameter, which defaults to np.logical_or, to determine how to combine masks. The _arithmetic_mask method is responsible for calculating the resulting mask in arithmetic operations, which is called within _arithmetic. \n\nGiven the issue description, it's important to modify the _arithmetic_mask method to handle cases where one operand has a mask of None, ensuring no operation is attempted between None and an integer. Specifically, the method should explicitly check for None masks and handle them by either copying the existing mask or creating a fully valid mask for the component that had None. \n\nThus, the identified code spans are those related to the handling of masks in the _arithmetic and _arithmetic_mask methods within the NDArithmeticMixin class.",

The `_arithmetic` method handles various aspects of arithmetic operations including mask handling. The `_arithmetic_mask` method specifically deals with mask propagation during arithmetic operations. It checks conditions for mask presence and uses the `handle_mask` function (which defaults to `np.logical_or`) to combine masks. From the context, it is clear that the issue arises when one operand does not have a mask, leading to a TypeError when `np.bitwise_or` tries to operate on an integer and a NoneType. This suggests that improvements are needed in the handling of NoneType masks, possibly by defining a behavior for when one operand lacks a mask, such as propagating the existing mask or defining a default mask behavior."

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
