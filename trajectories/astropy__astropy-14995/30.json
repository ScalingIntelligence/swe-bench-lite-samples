The key parts of the issue indicate that when the mask is None and an arithmetic operation like bitwise_or is attempted, a TypeError is raised because of the incompatible operand types. To address this, one would need to investigate how the masks are handled in the arithmetic operations within NDArithmeticMixin. Examining the class, it's clear that the _arithmetic method and its associated helper methods like _arithmetic_mask are central to understanding how masks are processed. The _arithmetic method sets up the operation and delegating the handling of masks to _arithmetic_mask, where the bitwise operations are likely occurring. The current code does not explicitly handle the case where one of the masks is None, which is likely causing the TypeError. Identifying these sections of code is crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
