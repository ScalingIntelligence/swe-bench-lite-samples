The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied to the output when one operand does not have a mask, which is not happening in v5.3. The problem arises from the bitwise_or operation attempting to operate on an integer and a NoneType when one of the operands lacks a mask. The current file context shows the NDDataRef class which inherits from NDArithmeticMixin. The search results offer insights into the NDArithmeticMixin class, specifically focusing on the _arithmetic method which handles arithmetic operations including mask propagation. The _arithmetic method includes logic for handling masks during arithmetic operations, but it seems to lack specific checks for when one operand has a mask of None, leading to the failure during operations like bitwise_or. Given the issue's description and the code analysis, the identified part of the code that needs attention is where the mask handling logic resides within the _arithmetic method in the NDArithmeticMixin class, ensuring proper handling of None masks to prevent type errors during operations.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
