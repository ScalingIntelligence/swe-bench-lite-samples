This results in a TypeError when attempting to use `np.bitwise_or` on an integer and a NoneType. The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output when one operand does not have a mask, similar to the behavior in v5.2.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` file within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class. Specifically, the `_arithmetic` method and the `_arithmetic_mask` method handle the mask propagation logic, which is where the error likely occurs. Additionally, the `multiply` method is directly involved in the arithmetic operations that trigger the issue.\n\nThe `_arithmetic` method orchestrates the arithmetic operation, including handling of masks, while the `_arithmetic_mask` method specifically deals with the mask propagation logic. The `multiply` method is a concrete implementation of an arithmetic operation using the `_arithmetic` method.\n\nBased on the reported issue, these methods are highly relevant as they directly handle the mask propagation during arithmetic operations in the NDDataRef class.",

This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n    different arithmetic operations.\n\n    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m.

See\n    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain\n    restrictions on the saved attributes::\n\n        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like\n          interface for uncertainty propagation\n        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``\n          operation.\n        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow\n          the operation.\n\n    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific\n    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to\n    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).\n    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like\n    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in\n    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no\n    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand\n    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's\n    uncertainty. This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n    different arithmetic operations.\n\n    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m.

See\n    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain\n    restrictions on the saved attributes::\n\n        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like\n          interface for uncertainty propagation\n        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``\n          operation.\n        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow\n          the operation.\n\n    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific\n    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to\n    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).\n    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like\n    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in\n    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no\n    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand\n    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's\n    uncertainty. This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n    different arithmetic operations.\n\n    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted\n    this behavior.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:\n\n        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin\n        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):\n        ...     pass\n\n    Using it with one operand on an instance::\n\n        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)\n        >>> ndd.add(20)\n        NDDataWithMath(120)\n\n    Using it with two operand on an instance::\n\n        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)\n        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)\n        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)\n\n    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::\n\n        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)\n        NDDataWithMath(1)\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def _arithmetic(\n        self,\n        operation,\n        operand,\n        propagate_uncertainties=True,\n        handle_mask=np.logical_or,\n        handle_meta=None,\n        uncertainty_correlation=0,\n        compare_wcs=\"first_found\",\n        operation_ignores_mask=False,\n        axis=None,\n        **kwds,\n    ):\n        \"\"\"\n        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n        This method determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the\n        ``data`` including their units and then forwards to other methods\n        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        operation : callable\n            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`.

See\n    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain\n    restrictions on the saved attributes::\n\n        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like\n          interface for uncertainty propagation\n        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``\n          operation.\n        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow\n          the operation.\n\n    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific\n    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to\n    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).\n    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like\n    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in\n    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no\n    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand\n    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's\n    uncertainty. This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n    different arithmetic operations.\n\n    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted\n    this behavior.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:\n\n        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin\n        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):\n        ...     pass\n\n    Using it with one operand on an instance::\n\n        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)\n        >>> ndd.add(20)\n        NDDataWithMath(120)\n\n    Using it with two operand on an instance::\n\n        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)\n        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)\n        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)\n\n    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::\n\n        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)\n        NDDataWithMath(1)\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def _arithmetic(\n        self,\n        operation,\n        operand,\n        propagate_uncertainties=True,\n        handle_mask=np.logical_or,\n        handle_meta=None,\n        uncertainty_correlation=0,\n        compare_wcs=\"first_found\",\n        operation_ignores_mask=False,\n        axis=None,\n        **kwds,\n    ):\n        \"\"\"\n        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n        This method determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the\n        ``data`` including their units and then forwards to other methods\n        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        operation : callable\n            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`.

See\n    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain\n    restrictions on the saved attributes::\n\n        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like\n          interface for uncertainty propagation\n        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``\n          operation.\n        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow\n          the operation.\n\n    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific\n    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to\n    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).\n    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like\n    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in\n    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no\n    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand\n    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's\n    uncertainty. This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n    different arithmetic operations.\n\n    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted\n    this behavior.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:\n\n        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin\n        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):\n        ...     pass\n\n    Using it with one operand on an instance::\n\n        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)\n        >>> ndd.add(20)\n        NDDataWithMath(120)\n\n    Using it with two operand on an instance::\n\n        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)\n        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)\n        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)\n\n    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::\n\n        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)\n        NDDataWithMath(1)\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def _arithmetic(\n        self,\n        operation,\n        operand,\n        propagate_uncertainties=True,\n        handle_mask=np.logical_or,\n        handle_meta=None,\n        uncertainty_correlation=0,\n        compare_wcs=\"first_found\",\n        operation_ignores_mask=False,\n        axis=None,\n        **kwds,\n    ):\n        \"\"\"\n        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n        This method determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the\n        ``data`` including their units and then forwards to other methods\n        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        operation : callable\n            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`.

See\n    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain\n    restrictions on the saved attributes::\n\n        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like\n          interface for uncertainty propagation\n        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``\n          operation.\n        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow\n          the operation.\n\n    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific\n    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to\n    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).\n    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like\n    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in\n    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no\n    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand\n    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's\n    uncertainty. This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n    different arithmetic operations.\n\n    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted\n    this behavior.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:\n\n        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin\n        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):\n        ...     pass\n\n    Using it with one operand on an instance::\n\n        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)\n        >>> ndd.add(20)\n        NDDataWithMath(120)\n\n    Using it with two operand on an instance::\n\n        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)\n        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)\n        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)\n\n    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::\n\n        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)\n        NDDataWithMath(1)\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def _arithmetic(\n        self,\n        operation,\n        operand,\n        propagate_uncertainties=True,\n        handle_mask=np.logical_or,\n        handle_meta=None,\n        uncertainty_correlation=0,\n        compare_wcs=\"first_found\",\n        operation_ignores_mask=False,\n        axis=None,\n        **kwds,\n    ):\n        \"\"\"\n        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.\n\n        This method determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the\n        ``data`` including their units and then forwards to other methods\n        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        operation : callable\n            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
