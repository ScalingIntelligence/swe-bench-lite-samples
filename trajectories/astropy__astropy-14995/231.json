This leads to a TypeError due to bitwise_or attempting to operate on an integer and None. The main focus should be on the NDArithmeticMixin in the ndarithmetic.py file, as it handles arithmetic operations and potentially the mask handling. Additionally, the NDDataArray in compat.py could be relevant, particularly the mask property and setter, as they deal directly with masks. It would also be prudent to investigate the _arithmetic function in ndarithmetic.py, as well as the _get_data_and_masks method in utils/masked/core.py, which appears to handle data and masks consistently.

I need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the mask propagation and arithmetic operations involving masks. In the search results, `NDArithmeticMixin` class in `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` contains key methods for arithmetic operations (`multiply`, `add`, `subtract`) and mask handling (`_arithmetic_mask`, `_arithmetic`). Specifically, the `_arithmetic_mask` method determines how the mask is handled during arithmetic operations. This method checks if one of the masks is `None` and decides the result mask accordingly. The method `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` is also critical as it prepares the operands before performing arithmetic operations. Overall, the relevant spans are those that handle mask propagation in arithmetic operations and specifically deal with cases where one of the masks is `None`.",

The error occurs specifically when using `np.bitwise_or` to handle masks, which fails because it tries to operate on an integer and a NoneType. The goal is to ensure that mask propagation behaves as it did in v5.2, where the existing mask is simply copied over when one operand lacks a mask. To address this, we need to focus on the `NDArithmeticMixin` class and its methods, particularly `_arithmetic_mask` and `_arithmetic`, as these are responsible for handling mask propagation during arithmetic operations. The new search results include the `NDDataArray` class, which inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`. This class initializes and sets masks, so it can be relevant for understanding how masks are handled in NDData objects. However, the provided spans in the new search results do not directly address the mask handling issue described in the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
