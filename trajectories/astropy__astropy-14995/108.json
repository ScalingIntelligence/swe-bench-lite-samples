But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue involves mask propagation failing during arithmetic operations when one operand lacks a mask in astropy version 5.3, specifically when using the `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` option. This behavior differs from version 5.2, where there were no such issues.\n\nFrom the provided file context, it's evident that the `NDDataRef` class inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, which is where the `multiply` method is defined. This method calls `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` internally to handle the arithmetic operation.\n\nIn the search results, the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method is shown. This method is crucial for understanding how the arithmetic operation is prepared and executed, including how masks are handled. It checks if the operands are instances of `NDArithmeticMixin` and tries to convert them if they are not.\n\nGiven the context, the actual implementation of arithmetic operations including mask handling is likely in a method called `_arithmetic` which is invoked by `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`. The presence of operations related to converting operands and checking their class types indicates that the method needs to handle operands with differing types, which likely includes handling cases where one operand does not have a mask. However, the direct implementation and handling of mask propagation, especially in the context of operations like `np.bitwise_or`, are not fully visible in the provided code spans. \n\nTo fully address the issue, one would need to see the implementation of the `_arithmetic` method and how it specifically handles the mask propagation when encountering operands with and without masks. Since the exact code related to this handling is not provided in the search results, identifying the precise relevant spans without the `_arithmetic` method content or direct mask handling in the provided spans is not feasible.",

The issue likely arises in the `_arithmetic` method where the mask handling is performed. The code checks for the presence of masks and uses np.logical_or to handle them, which is where the failure occurs if one mask is None. This method handles both the data and the mask during arithmetic operations.\n\nFurthermore, the `multiply` method in the same class, which is a specific implementation of arithmetic operations, passes through to `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` and subsequently to `_arithmetic`. This chain of method calls suggests that the multiply operation's failure with one operand lacking a mask is directly related to the mask handling logic in `_arithmetic`.\n\nGiven the full context and the important sections of the code, it is clear that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue because they directly deal with the mask propagation and handling during arithmetic operations within the NDDataRef class.",
