The error occurs during the bitwise_or operation between a mask and a NoneType, indicating a problem in how the mask is handled when one of the operands does not have a mask. The relevant code spans from the provided search results that are most likely to be involved in this mask handling are '_arithmetic', '_arithmetic_mask', and possibly '_arithmetic_uncertainty'. These methods deal directly with mask handling and uncertainty propagation, which are critical for addressing the reported issue. The '_arithmetic' method is the main entry point for arithmetic operations and controls how masks are handled via the 'handle_mask' parameter. The '_arithmetic_mask' method specifically handles the mask operations, including how the mask is propagated or copied when one operand lacks a mask. The '_arithmetic_uncertainty' method, while primarily dealing with uncertainties, might also indirectly affect mask handling if uncertainties and masks are tied together in the implementation. Given the detailed description of the error and the relevant code spans identified, it is likely that the issue can be addressed by modifying the '_arithmetic_mask' method to handle cases where one operand's mask is None, ensuring that the bitwise_or operation does not fail in such scenarios.",

The class includes methods for handling arithmetic operations, including mask propagation. Specifically, the `_arithmetic_mask` method is responsible for calculating the resulting mask during arithmetic operations. The method checks if both operands have masks and then applies the provided `handle_mask` function (like `np.bitwise_or`) to compute the resulting mask. The issue at hand involves the failure of mask propagation when one operand lacks a mask, which is directly addressed by the `_arithmetic_mask` method's handling of cases where a mask may be `None`. Therefore, the provided file context seems to cover the relevant code and logic needed to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
