The primary concern is that when using np.bitwise_or to handle masks, operations involving operands with and without masks result in a TypeError due to an attempt to perform a bitwise operation between an integer and a NoneType. The expected behavior is for the operation to handle cases where masks are incomplete without raising errors. In the provided search results, several key sections of code are relevant to this issue:\n1. The `_arithmetic_mask` method in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class is responsible for handling the mask during arithmetic operations. This method should be scrutinized to ensure it appropriately handles cases where one operand's mask is None.\n2. The `multiply` method in the same class demonstrates the use of arithmetic operations, including the handling of masks with np.bitwise_or. This is directly related to the reported issue.\n3. The `MaskedNDArray` class and its methods, such as `__new__` and `__array_ufunc__`, are pertinent as they deal with masked arrays, which are central to the issue of mask propagation.\nBy examining and potentially modifying these sections, it may be possible to resolve the issue where mask propagation fails due to the presence of a NoneType mask in one of the operands.",

The current implementation fails to handle cases where one operand's mask is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when attempting bitwise operations between an integer and `NoneType`. To resolve this, we need to ensure that in the `_arithmetic_mask` method, if one operand's mask is `None`, it should not attempt to perform bitwise operations but instead return the mask of the other operand. This aligns with the expected behavior of simply copying over the existing mask to the output when one operand lacks a mask.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
