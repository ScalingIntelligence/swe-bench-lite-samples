The key points from the issue are: 1) When one operand lacks a mask, the operation fails. 2) The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output or handled as it was in v5.2. The search results contain relevant code from 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' within the 'NDArithmeticMixin' class, which includes methods for arithmetic operations and mask handling. The '_arithmetic' method is particularly relevant as it manages the mask handling based on the provided 'handle_mask' parameter. Specifically, the '_arithmetic_mask' method is the central point for determining how masks are combined during operations. Additionally, the 'multiply' method is directly related to the arithmetic operation described in the issue. Both these methods need to be reviewed to ensure they handle None masks appropriately, likely by implementing a check to skip operations involving None masks or by assigning a default mask value when one is missing. The provided code segments already have mechanisms to handle mask propagation based on the presence of masks in operands, but adjustments may be needed to address the specific issue of handling None masks correctly. These are the key areas of the code that should be focused on to resolve the reported issue.",

The method checks if either operand has a mask and applies the specified `handle_mask` function (like `np.logical_or` by default) to combine them. If one of the operands does not have a mask, it simply uses the mask of the other operand, which could lead to the error described if the other operand's mask is None. Additionally, the `multiply` method uses the `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method, which ultimately calls `_arithmetic`, where mask handling is defined.

The task is to identify relevant code spans in the provided search results that address this issue. The current file context indicates that the relevant file is 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' and focuses on the methods within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class. The search results reaffirm this focus by providing additional context around the `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask` methods, which are central to handling arithmetic operations and their associated masks. The identified code spans include: 1. `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic` for handling the main arithmetic operations and determining the mask handling logic. 2. `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` for handling the mask operations during arithmetic, particularly where mask handling logic is defined. These code spans are critical because they directly handle the mask propagation and the logic for combining masks from operands, which is central to resolving the reported issue. For completeness, it's also noted that the `multiply` method within the same class is likely to be relevant due to its direct involvement in arithmetic operations.",
