This error occurs in version 5.3 but not in 5.2. The analysis involves identifying code spans related to arithmetic operations and mask handling in the NDDataRef class and its mixins. The search results reveal crucial functions and methods such as `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and `multiply`, which are directly involved in arithmetic operations and mask propagation. These methods handle the logic for applying operations, managing masks, and performing arithmetic, including the `_arithmetic_mask` method which handles the mask propagation logic. Additionally, the `multiply` method is relevant as it encapsulates the multiplication operation and how it interacts with mask handling. The `NDDataRef` class itself is also significant as it inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, `NDIOMixin`, and `NDSlicingMixin`, tying the arithmetic and mask handling functionality together. It is apparent from the analysis that these identified spans are critical for addressing the reported issue, covering the essential aspects of arithmetic operations and mask handling in NDDataRef.",
