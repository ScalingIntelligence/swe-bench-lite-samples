To address this, we need to focus on the `NDArithmeticMixin` class and its methods, particularly `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask`. The `_arithmetic_mask` method is responsible for calculating the resulting mask based on the input masks of the operands. The issue likely arises because `_arithmetic_mask` does not handle `None` masks explicitly, leading to the error when `np.bitwise_or` operates on an integer and `None`. Reviewing the code spans in 'NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic' and 'NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask' will help identify the necessary modifications or checks to prevent the error from occurring.",

The `_arithmetic_mask` method specifically deals with the scenario where operands may or may not have masks, including the case where one operand's mask is None. The code checks if either operand's mask is None and handles it appropriately by copying the mask from the other operand or applying a bitwise operation if both masks are present. This suggests that the code does try to handle None masks, but the TypeError indicates that there might still be a case where the handling fails. Further inspection within the method logic might reveal the specific condition leading to the TypeError.

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n"
