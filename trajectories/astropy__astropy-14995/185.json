Specifically, when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, the operation fails due to an attempt to operate on an integer and a None. The goal is to ensure that when one operand lacks a mask, the existing mask should be copied over to the output or handled in a way that mimics the behavior in v5.2.\n\nReviewing the `NDArithmeticMixin` class in the `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` file, the key method appears to be `_arithmetic`, which is responsible for handling arithmetic operations and mask propagation. The method `_arithmetic` includes logic to handle masks with different strategies, including `np.logical_or`, but it does not explicitly handle the case where one operand's mask is None, which leads to the observed failure. This logic is crucial for understanding and fixing the reported issue.\n\nThe identified spans include the entire `NDArithmeticMixin` class definition, focusing particularly on `_arithmetic`, and the methods `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, which call `_arithmetic` with specific operations. These methods are directly related to the arithmetic operations discussed in the issue.\n\nGiven the context, the relevant code spans are the `_arithmetic` method and the arithmetic methods (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) that utilize it. These spans encapsulate the core logic that needs to be adjusted to handle the case where one of the operand masks is None correctly.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
