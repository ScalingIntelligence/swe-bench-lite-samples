The issue specifically arises when one of the operands does not have a mask, causing the mask propagation to fail when using 'np.bitwise_or'. The error occurring in v5.3 but not in v5.2 suggests a change in how mask handling is implemented in the newer version. The provided search results show that the relevant code spans are within the 'NDArithmeticMixin' class, specifically in its '_arithmetic_mask' method. This method deals with mask propagation, handling cases where either operand has no mask. The method's logic does not account for the situation where the operation 'np.bitwise_or' is used on an integer and a 'NoneType', which results in the TypeError. This mismatch aligns perfectly with the reported issue's description. Therefore, the code span identified as relevant to the reported issue is within 'NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask'.",

The multiply method is particularly relevant as it is mentioned in the reported issue as causing the TypeError due to mask handling with NoneType.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
