In v5.3, it seems there might be an issue when one operand does not have a mask, causing a TypeError when trying to perform a bitwise operation involving a NoneType. To resolve this, we should first thoroughly review the _arithmetic and _arithmetic_mask methods in v5.3 to identify where the NoneType is not handled appropriately. Additionally, comparing this behavior with the corresponding methods in v5.2 will help uncover any changes that might have led to this issue.

This results in a TypeError due to the attempt to operate on an integer and a NoneType. From the context and new search results, the relevant code spans primarily revolve around the `NDArithmeticMixin` class and its methods `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask`. These methods handle the arithmetic operations and the mask propagation logic, respectively. Additionally, the `NDDataArray` and `NDData` classes contribute to the handling of masks within the `NDData` framework. Given the issue's nature, focusing on the logic within these methods where mask propagation decisions are made and operational errors can occur is crucial. Evaluating these sections of the code will help identify and address the core of the reported issue.",

The code specifically addresses the behavior of mask propagation with operations like `np.bitwise_or`. It includes checks for the presence of masks in both operands and decides how to handle the mask based on the `handle_mask` argument. The code also includes handling for cases where one operand does not have a mask, where it returns the mask from the other operand. The `NDDataArray` class in `astropy/nddata/compat.py` handles the mask property, including cases where the mask is `None`. The `NDData` class in `astropy/nddata/nddata.py` also deals with mask initialization and property setting. It includes handling for various data types including `Masked`, ensuring masks are correctly propagated during initialization. This comprehensive handling suggests that all relevant parts of the codebase for dealing with mask propagation in arithmetic operations have been identified, as they collectively address the expected behavior and issues raised in the reported problem. Comparing this with the expected behavior in v5.2 suggests that the identified code sections should be sufficient to address the bug described in v5.3.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
