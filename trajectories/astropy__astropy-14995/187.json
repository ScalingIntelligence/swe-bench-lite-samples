From the provided context, several relevant files and classes are identified: NDDataRef, NDArithmeticMixin, and Masked. The focus should be on these classes and their methods that handle arithmetic operations and mask processing. Specifically, the failure occurs with handle_mask=np.bitwise_or in the multiply method of NDDataRef, which suggests investigating the _arithmetic and _arithmetic_mask methods in the NDArithmeticMixin class. Additionally, the core functionality for handling masks in the Masked class should be examined.",

The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output if one of the operands lacks a mask. The relevant code spans are identified in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, which contains the methods for arithmetic operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`), and the helper methods (`_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_data`, `_arithmetic_uncertainty`, `_arithmetic_mask`) that handle the propagation of uncertainties, data, and masks during these operations. The issue likely arises in the handling of masks, particularly in the `_arithmetic_mask` method where the mask propagation logic resides. Additionally, the `NDDataRef` class inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, indicating that it uses these arithmetic operations, aligning with the context of the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans in `NDArithmeticMixin` are highly relevant to resolving the mask propagation issue.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
