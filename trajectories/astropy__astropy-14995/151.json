The error occurs due to an attempt to perform a bitwise OR operation between an integer and a NoneType. To address this, it's crucial to examine the code responsible for handling masks during arithmetic operations. The provided search results include the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, which contains the `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask` methods. These methods are central to the process of handling masks during arithmetic operations. The `_arithmetic` method defines how masks are handled and passed to the operation, while the `_arithmetic_mask` method specifically deals with creating the resulting mask. Reviewing these methods reveals that the code does not explicitly handle the case where one operand's mask is None, which leads to theTypeError. Therefore, these methods are relevant to the reported issue and need further examination and possible modification to handle None masks appropriately.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
