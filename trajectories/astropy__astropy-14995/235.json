The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output, similar to how it worked in v5.2 without errors. The search results reveal two relevant code spans within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class in 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py': one in the `_arithmetic_mask` method and another in the `multiply` method. The `_arithmetic_mask` method is crucial as it handles the mask during arithmetic operations. It needs to be adjusted to handle cases where one of the operands does not have a mask, ensuring that operations like `np.bitwise_or` do not fail due to type mismatches (e.g., 'int' and 'NoneType'). This method currently lacks specific handling for the case where one operand's mask is `None`, which matches the described issue. Furthermore, the `multiply` method shows how the arithmetic operations are initiated, reinforcing its relevance to the reported issue.

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
