Analysis of the provided code reveals that the `NDArithmeticMixin` class is a primary candidate as it contains methods for arithmetic operations and mask handling.\n\nThe `_arithmetic` method in `NDArithmeticMixin` is particularly relevant as it deals with the core logic for arithmetic operations, including how masks are handled. The method `_arithmetic_mask` also appears crucial for understanding mask propagation logic during arithmetic operations. Additionally, the `multiply` method inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, and since the issue manifests during multiplication operations, it further supports the relevance of the identified code spans.\n\nOverall, these code spans provide a good basis for understanding and potentially fixing the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
