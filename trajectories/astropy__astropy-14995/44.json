This issue surfaces in v5.3 but not in v5.2. The expected behavior is that the mask should be propagated correctly, even when one operand lacks a mask, similar to how it worked in v5.2. The key problem identified is that an operand without a mask is treated as having a mask of None's, which causes a TypeError when `np.bitwise_or` attempts to operate on an integer and a None. Reviewing the provided code span in `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask`, it is clear that this method handles mask propagation in arithmetic operations. The method already has logic to handle cases where masks are None, but there seems to be a discrepancy in how these cases are managed compared to the expected behavior outlined in the issue. Specifically, the method does not account for the specific error scenario described, where `np.bitwise_or` fails due to a NoneType operand. This suggests that the identified code span is directly relevant to the reported issue and requires adjustments to correctly handle the case where one operand lacks a mask. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete for identifying relevant code, but additional work will be needed to resolve the issue.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n"
