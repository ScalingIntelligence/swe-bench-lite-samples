The issue specifically points to failures when one operand lacks a mask, leading to a TypeError due to incompatible types when performing bitwise operations.

The '_arithmetic' method controls the overall arithmetic operation and the '_arithmetic_mask' method specifically handles the mask arithmetic. These methods are the core of the functionality described in the issue, especially where mask handling and potential errors occur.

The provided file context includes the NDArithmeticMixin class and its _arithmetic method, particularly the segment where mask handling is done in the _arithmetic_mask method. The code inspects the masks of both operands and decides how to handle them based on whether they are None or not. The existing code correctly handles the cases where both masks are None or only one is None by returning None or the non-None mask. The issue seems to arise when the np.bitwise_or operation is performed on a mask that contains None values.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
