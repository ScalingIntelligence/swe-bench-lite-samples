This causes errors when performing arithmetic operations with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. The expected behavior is that the mask should be copied over when one operand lacks a mask, which worked correctly in v5.2 but is failing in v5.3.\n\nIn the search results, we find relevant code spans within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class. Specifically, the method `_arithmetic_mask` and its usage within `_arithmetic` are the likely places responsible for handling these operations. The `_arithmetic_mask` method looks at how masks are combined, particularly with `handle_mask`. There's also detailed handling of what to do when one of the masks is None in `_arithmetic_mask`, which directly relates to the issue described regarding `np.bitwise_or`. The identified code spans should help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the reported problem.",

The current implementation returns `None` if both masks are `None` or if `handle_mask` is `None`. It also handles copying the mask from the operand if the self mask is `None` and vice versa. The actual bitwise operation (e.g., np.logical_or) is performed when both masks are present. However, there's no explicit handling for cases where one mask is `None` and the other is an integer array. This could be the source of the error when using `np.bitwise_or`.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
