The issue specifically mentions that this behavior changed between v5.2 and v5.3, leading to a TypeError when using np.bitwise_or to handle masks. The relevant code spans in the search results suggest several methods in the NDArithmeticMixin class that are likely involved in handling arithmetic operations and mask propagation: _arithmetic, _arithmetic_mask, and multiply. The _arithmetic method is central as it orchestrates the arithmetic operations and mask handling. It calls _arithmetic_mask which directly handles the mask propagation, making it a critical part to inspect. The multiply method, which is the user-facing method for multiplication operations, calls _prepare_then_do_arithmetic, which in turn uses _arithmetic. The _arithmetic_mask method's logic for handling cases where masks are None is particularly relevant to the issue reported. Additionally, the _arithmetic method contains logic for handling different strategies for mask propagation, including using np.logical_or. Given the specific error involving np.bitwise_or with a NoneType mask operand, it's essential to ensure that the code properly handles the scenario where not all operands have masks. This examination indicates that the provided code spans are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

The key insight is that the bitwise_or operation fails when an integer is compared with None. The expected behavior is that the mask should be propagated correctly or copied over from the existing mask when one operand lacks a mask, similar to the functionality in v5.2. The provided code context and search results primarily focus on the NDArithmeticMixin class, which is central to handling arithmetic operations in NDDataRef, especially concerning mask handling. The _arithmetic method and its sub-methods like _arithmetic_mask directly deal with mask propagation and are likely where the error occurs. The search results do not add significantly new information but confirm the centrality of these methods in addressing the issue. Given the nature of the reported problem and the context provided, the identified code spans seem relevant and complete for addressing the issue based on the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
