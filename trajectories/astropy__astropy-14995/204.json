The key points from the issue are:\n\n1. When one operand does not have a mask, the operation using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails due to attempting to perform a bitwise OR operation between an integer and a NoneType.\n2. The expected behavior is that if one operand lacks a mask, the existing mask should be propagated to the output.\n\nTo address this, I focused on the `NDArithmeticMixin` class within the `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` file, particularly the `_arithmetic_mask` method, which is responsible for handling mask operations during arithmetic. This method determines the resulting mask based on the masks of the operands. I identified the following relevant spans in the code:\n\n- Span `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` - This method directly deals with mask handling during arithmetic operations, and it is likely where the bug causing the TypeError is located.\n- Span `NDArithmeticMixin.multiply` - This method involves arithmetic operations and uses the `_arithmetic_mask` method, making it relevant for reproducing and addressing the issue.\n\nGiven these spans, I concluded that they are directly relevant to the reported issue.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
