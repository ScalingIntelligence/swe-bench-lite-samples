The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over or handled similarly to how it was in v5.2 without errors. The relevant code sections likely involve arithmetic operations in NDDataRef and handling of masks in NDArithmeticMixin.

The TypeError 'unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'' occurs when using np.bitwise_or to handle the mask. I've inspected the provided context and search results. The NDArithmeticMixin class in 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' is relevant, particularly the '_arithmetic' and '_arithmetic_mask' methods where mask handling logic is defined. The problem likely arises in the '_arithmetic' method triggered by arithmetic operations like 'multiply', where mask handling with None values causes issues. The search results support this, showing the 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide' methods which all call '_prepare_then_do_arithmetic' ultimately leading to '_arithmetic'. The '_arithmetic_mask' is responsible for calculating the resulting mask and might not have handled None properly leading to the TypeError. Fixing this requires a change in the mask handling in '_arithmetic' or '_arithmetic_mask' to ensure it doesn't try to operate on None when a mask is missing, or handle it as an identity operation or by copying over the existing mask.",

In such instances, it returns None or deepcopies the non-None mask, avoiding direct operations between a mask and None. Additionally, the arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) use the _prepare_then_do_arithmetic method, which in turn utilizes the _arithmetic method. This setup ensures that mask handling in arithmetic operations is centralized and consistent. Further, the _arithmetic method's mask handling logic appears comprehensive, covering cases where either operand has a mask or not. Based on the provided code and logic, it seems that the mask handling during arithmetic operations in NDArithmeticMixin is well-considered and should manage NoneType masks effectively.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
