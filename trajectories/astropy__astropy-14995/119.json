The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output when one operand lacks a mask, similar to how it worked in the previous version (v5.2).\n\nThe provided file context and search results show the implementation of the NDArithmeticMixin class and its methods, including `multiply`, which is directly related to the issue. The `NDArithmeticMixin._prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method is of particular interest as it handles the logic for arithmetic operations, including the handling of masks. This method is where the mask propagation logic should be examined and potentially corrected.\n\nSince the search results include the relevant methods `multiply` and `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`, it appears sufficient to address the reported issue.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the failure of mask propagation in NDDataRef arithmetic operations when one of the operands lacks a mask. The error specifically occurs with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, indicating that the operation attempts to perform a bitwise OR between an integer and a NoneType, which results in a TypeError. The expected behavior is that the mask should be copied over to the output when one of the operands does not have a mask, similar to the functionality in v5.2.\n\nFrom the file context provided, we have identified key parts of the code within `NDArithmeticMixin`. This class includes methods for arithmetic operations such as `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, which internally call `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic` and eventually `_arithmetic` for actual arithmetic processing. The `_arithmetic` method handles mask propagation using the `handle_mask` parameter.\n\nIn the new search results, additional sections of `NDArithmeticMixin` are provided, including the `_arithmetic_mask` method, which directly deals with mask handling during arithmetic operations. This method checks for the presence of masks and applies the `handle_mask` operation. The issue described is likely to be resolved within this section of the code, where the handling of NoneType masks needs to be addressed to prevent the TypeError.\n\nTo fix the issue, the `_arithmetic_mask` method should be modified to handle cases where one of the masks is None without causing a TypeError. This modification should ensure that if one mask is None, the other mask is directly used, or a new mask is created that includes all elements, ensuring that arithmetic operations involving masks (especially with `np.bitwise_or`) do not fail due to NoneType masks.\n\nKey spans in the code to focus on for resolving this issue include `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` and potentially `NDArithmeticMixin._prepare_then_do_arithmetic` if there are further interactions with mask handling that can be checked for robustness.",
