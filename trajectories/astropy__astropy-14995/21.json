            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to mask propagation failing when one of the operands in NDDataRef arithmetic operations does not have a mask in v5.3. This specifically affects operations using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, where the error arises due to an attempt to apply bitwise OR between an integer and `NoneType`. The current search results provide a relevant code span within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class. In this class, the `_arithmetic` method handles various arithmetic operations, including mask handling. Key parts of this method engage with `handle_mask`, which in the provided spans directly interacts with how masks are treated during arithmetic operations. This alignment suggests that the `_arithmetic` method's handling of masks and specifically the case where an operand might not have a mask, could be the root cause of the reported issue. Notably, the method conditionally handles masks based on whether a result or operand has a mask, and it calls `_arithmetic_mask` when `handle_mask` is not `None`. Given the issue description and the involved function's role, it is reasonable to infer that the identified section of code is highly relevant to resolving the reported problem. Potential fixes or adjustments to handle cases where an operand lacks a mask more gracefully might be required here. Additionally, the `multiply` method, which relies on the `_arithmetic` method for its operations, indicates that modifications in `_arithmetic` could affect how multiplication operations involving NDDataRef instances are handled in terms of mask propagation.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
