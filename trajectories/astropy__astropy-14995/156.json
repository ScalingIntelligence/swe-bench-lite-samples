Specifically, when one operand lacks a mask, the mask propagation fails with a TypeError when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output or to replicate the behavior from the previous version where there was no issue.\n\nThe code provided in the search results includes the `NDArithmeticMixin` class which is likely involved in handling arithmetic operations on NDData objects. The method `_arithmetic` handles the core arithmetic logic, including mask propagation. The method `_arithmetic_mask` is responsible for determining the resulting mask after an operation, which involves handling cases where one or both operands lack masks. The `multiply` method, which is used in the provided example code, delegates to `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`, which in turn calls `_arithmetic` to perform the multiplication with mask handling. Based on context and function name, these methods are highly relevant as they directly deal with arithmetic operations and mask handling in NDData.\n\nSpecifically, the issues likely arise where masks are handled in `_arithmetic_mask`. The failure case described in the issue (TypeError due to 'int' and 'NoneType') suggests that the code does not adequately handle cases where an operand has a `None` mask. To fix this, the code might need to be adjusted to treat `None` masks as identities for the `np.bitwise_or` operation or ensure that such cases do not lead to trying to perform bitwise operations on `None` types.\n\nGiven the relevance of mask handling in arithmetic operations and the specific focus on how masks are computed in `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask`, the provided code spans cover the areas that need to be examined and potentially adjusted to resolve the reported issue.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
