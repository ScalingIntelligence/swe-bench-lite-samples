This results in a TypeError when performing operations with handle_mask=np.bitwise_or. The issue is not present in version 5.2 of astropy. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the NDArithmeticMixin class that handle mask propagation during arithmetic operations. We focus on the _arithmetic_mask method as it directly deals with mask handling. It currently handles the case where one of the masks is None by returning the mask of the other operand, which, when combined with bitwise_or, leads to the TypeError. The solution should involve ensuring that operations involving None masks are handled gracefully, possibly by allowing operations to proceed without attempting to use None in bitwise operations. This involves understanding the logic within _arithmetic_mask and potentially modifying it to account for None masks in a way that avoids the TypeError. The code samples provided in the issue demonstrate the problematic behavior, and the identified code in _arithmetic_mask needs to be adjusted to handle these cases properly.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
