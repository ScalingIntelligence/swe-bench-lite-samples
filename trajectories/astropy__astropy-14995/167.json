The error occurs when `np.bitwise_or` is used to handle masks, as it attempts to operate on an integer and a NoneType. To resolve this, it's necessary to identify where the mask handling logic in NDDataRef (e.g., in `NDArithmeticMixin` or related classes) checks for and handles the absence of a mask. Potential locations include the `_arithmetic_mask` method and the `_arithmetic` method within `NDArithmeticMixin`, as well as related utility functions or methods in `NDDataRef` and its mixins. Additional scrutiny should be given to how masks are initially set and propagated within the NDData framework.",

This results in a TypeError when using `np.bitwise_or`. The key focus is on how the mask handling mechanism in versions 5.2 and 5.3 differs. The code analysis begins with examining the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, which is pivotal for understanding mask handling during arithmetic operations. Several spans within this class appear relevant: '_arithmetic', '_arithmetic_mask', '_arithmetic_data', and '_arithmetic_uncertainty'. These spans collectively define the arithmetic operations and their interactions with masks, uncertainties, and data. Specifically, the '_arithmetic_mask' span directly addresses mask handling by determining how masks are propagated or combined. It notably checks for None masks and applies the specified mask handling operation (like `np.bitwise_or`). This span is highly relevant as it directly relates to the reported mask propagation error. Other spans (like '_arithmetic_data' and '_arithmetic_uncertainty') are also essential for a complete understanding of how arithmetic operations interact with different attributes of NDDataRef, including mask handling indirectly.\n\nAdditionally, the `NDDataRef` class from 'nddata_withmixins.py' is identified as a subclass of `NDArithmeticMixin`, reaffirming its relevance to the issue at hand. The '_arithmetic' function in 'ccddata.py' is also relevant, as it decorates methods for arithmetic operations, potentially influencing how operations are executed in subclasses like NDDataRef.",

To resolve this, it's necessary to identify where the mask handling logic in NDDataRef (e.g., in `NDArithmeticMixin` or related classes) checks for and handles the absence of a mask. Potential locations include the `_arithmetic_mask` method and the `_arithmetic` method within `NDArithmeticMixin`, as well as related utility functions or methods in `NDDataRef` and its mixins.

This method checks if masks are present and calculates the resulting mask using a provided mask handler, which defaults to `np.logical_or`. The file context also indicates that `NDDataRef` inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, suggesting that it uses these methods for arithmetic operations including mask propagation.

The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output or for the operation to handle the missing mask as it did in v5.2.\n\nAfter reviewing the file context, I observed that the current implementation in `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic` method does handle the mask, but it appears to lack specific handling for cases where one operand lacks a mask, leading to errors when using `np.bitwise_or`. This suggests a potential issue in the mask handling logic within `_arithmetic_mask` and possibly also within `_arithmetic_data`.\n\nUpon processing the new search results, particularly focusing on the relevant sections within `NDArithmeticMixin`, the identified relevant code spans include `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, `_arithmetic_data`, and `_arithmetic_uncertainty`. These spans provide a comprehensive look at how arithmetic operations are handled in the context of mask propagation, data operations, and uncertainty propagation.\n\nTherefore, based on the reported issue and the detailed analysis of the current code context and new search results, the relevant code spans that need to be addressed are those that specifically deal with mask handling and arithmetic operations when masks may be absent in one of the operands. The identified spans in the file 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' should assist in understanding and potentially rectifying the described issue.",

Specifically, the `_arithmetic` method is responsible for carrying out arithmetic operations, and it delegates mask handling to the `_arithmetic_mask` method. This method checks if masks are present and calculates the resulting mask using a provided mask handler, which defaults to `np.logical_or`. The file context also indicates that `NDDataRef` inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, suggesting that it uses these methods for arithmetic operations including mask propagation. Given this information, I will focus the search on these methods and related utility functions within the `NDData` and `NDArithmeticMixin` classes to locate the exact points where mask handling logic needs to be adjusted or added to handle cases where one operand lacks a mask.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
