The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output when one operand lacks a mask, similar to the behavior in v5.2.\n\nFrom the search results, several relevant code spans have been identified that handle arithmetic operations and mask propagation:\n\n1. `NDArithmeticMixin` class: This class contains the core logic for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes methods for handling masks during these operations.\n2. `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic` method: This method orchestrates the arithmetic operation, including how masks are handled.\n3. `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` method: This method specifically deals with the mask propagation logic. The current implementation seems to handle cases where both operands or neither have masks, but it fails when one operand lacks a mask.\n\nIn the provided search results, `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic` and `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` are particularly relevant. The first method sets up the arithmetic operation and the handling of masks, while the second method directly addresses the mask handling that causes the issue when one operand does not have a mask. These methods need to be modified to ensure that when one operand does not have a mask, the existing mask from the other operand is correctly propagated to the output, without causing a TypeError due to the attempted operation between an integer and None. The expectation is that this behavior should mirror the successful mask handling from v5.2.\n\nAdditional considerations should be made to ensure that all arithmetic methods within `NDArithmeticMixin` correctly implement this new mask handling logic, as the other methods (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are all expected to behave consistently with respect to mask propagation.",

The `_arithmetic_mask` method specifically handles the combining of masks from both operands. The issue described involves a TypeError when using `np.bitwise_or` with operands where one lacks a mask, indicating a potential issue in how `None` and int are being handled in the mask treatment logic.

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
