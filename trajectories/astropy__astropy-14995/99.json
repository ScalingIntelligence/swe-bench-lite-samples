The key areas to focus on in the search results are the methods responsible for handling mask arithmetic, particularly '_arithmetic_mask' and '_arithmetic'. In '_arithmetic_mask', the method is designed to handle mask propagation based on the presence or absence of masks in both operands. However, the current implementation does not explicitly deal with the scenario where one operand has a mask of None, which could be causing the reported issue. The '_arithmetic' method, as the master method controlling arithmetic operations, also needs to be reviewed to ensure that it properly manages the handling of mask properties during operations. Based on the reported issue and the current context of identified code, the most relevant code spans are those handling mask propagation and overall arithmetic operations in the NDArithmeticMixin class.",

The error indicates a TypeError due to an attempt to perform a bitwise operation between an integer and a NoneType. The relevant code for handling mask propagation during arithmetic operations is found in the _arithmetic_mask method of the NDArithmeticMixin class. This method is designed to handle the combination of masks from two operands, including cases where one operand might have a None mask. The current implementation of _arithmetic_mask checks if either self.mask or operand.mask is None and returns the other mask if one is None. This setup suggests that the method is intended to handle cases where one operand lacks a mask, but the specific behavior with np.bitwise_or hasn't been thoroughly tested or implemented to handle None masks properly.

The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output. The issue points to specific arithmetic operations (multiply, add, subtract, divide) that are failing due to the interaction between masks (or lack thereof) and the bitwise_or operation. The relevant code spans from the search results are those that handle arithmetic operations and mask handling within the NDArithmeticMixin class. Specifically, the methods _arithmetic, _arithmetic_mask, and the arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) themselves are critical. The method _arithmetic handles the overall arithmetic operation, including mask handling. The method _arithmetic_mask specifically deals with the mask handling logic, and the arithmetic operation methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are the entry points for these operations. Additionally, the _prepare_then_do_arithmetic method is involved in preparing the operands for the arithmetic operations. The code in ccddata.py related to _arithmetic is also relevant as it pertains to the arithmetic operations on CCDData objects, which likely use the NDArithmeticMixin internally.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
