The problem likely arises when one operand's mask is `None`\u2014a valid state indicating the absence of a mask\u2014and this `None` is not properly handled before attempting the `np.bitwise_or` operation. This operation, which expects two operands to be of mask-like type (e.g., arrays or other suitable types), fails when one operand is `None`.

The analysis of provided search results reveals that the NDArithmeticMixin class is central to these operations. Relevant spans include '_arithmetic', '_arithmetic_mask', and 'multiply'. The '_arithmetic' method sets up the environment for arithmetic operations, including how masks are handled. The '_arithmetic_mask' method specifically deals with the computation of the resulting mask during such operations. The 'multiply' method, which is the site of the reported error, uses '_prepare_then_do_arithmetic' to execute the multiplication operation. Given the issue description, it seems that the '_arithmetic_mask' method might need adjustments to handle properly the situation where one operand's mask is None. Additionally, the '_arithmetic' method might need to be reviewed to ensure it sets up the mask handling correctly for all operations. These findings suggest that the codebase currently does not handle None-mask situations appropriately in arithmetic operations, leading to the TypeError when using bitwise_or. This indicates a need for a more nuanced handling of masks in arithmetic, perhaps echoing the behavior from v5.2 to resolve the issue. The provided search results are relevant and should be sufficient to start implementing the necessary changes.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
