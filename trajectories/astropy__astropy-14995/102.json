The relevant code spans identified are within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, specifically the `_arithmetic_mask` method where the mask handling is implemented. This method is crucial for managing how masks are propagated and combined during arithmetic operations. The other spans within `NDArithmeticMixin` relate to other aspects of arithmetic handling such as data, uncertainty, and metadata, which, while important, are not the direct cause of the reported issue. Therefore, the focus should remain on the mask handling code. Additionally, the `NDDataRef` class, which is a subclass of `NDArithmeticMixin`, is the class used in the demonstration of the issue.

The provided file context contains the relevant code snippet from the NDArithmeticMixin class, which shows how masks are managed in arithmetic operations. In particular, the `_arithmetic_mask` method attempts to handle cases where masks might be missing, but it does not explicitly account for the possibility of 'None' values being passed directly to the `handle_mask` function, which in this case is `np.bitwise_or`. Given the explicit mention of `np.bitwise_or` as the function causing the TypeError in the issue description, the detected code section appears pertinent. However, the specific condition causing the TypeError (where an integer meets a NoneType) isn't explicitly addressed in the provided code snippet. Hence, while the context contains relevant code, it may not include all necessary changes to rectify the exact issue described.",

The issue is not present in v5.2. The main points to address in the code are: 1) Handling the case where one operand has no mask. 2) Ensuring that the mask, if it exists, is properly propagated or copied over to the output. 3) Avoiding type errors when the operation involves a mask of NoneType. The provided file context and search results contain relevant sections of the code, specifically: - 'NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask' in astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py, which deals with how the mask is handled during arithmetic operations. - 'NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic' in the same file, which orchestrates the arithmetic operations and uses the mask handling method. Additionally, 'NDDataRef' in astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py shows the class inheritance and implementation that ties together the mixins including NDArithmeticMixin. The code inspection confirms that the handling of masks in 'NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask' might not account for situations where one of the masks is None, leading to errors like the one described. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and suggest modifications in the 'NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask' method to properly handle None masks.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
