Specifically, the issue arises when performing arithmetic operations with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` and one operand has a mask of None, leading to a TypeError. The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output when one operand lacks a mask. The provided code spans from `astropy/nddata/nddata.py` and `astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py` are relevant as they define the `NDData` and `NDDataRef` classes, which are central to the issue. Specifically, `NDData.__init__` method handles the initialization of data, mask, and other attributes, which is crucial for understanding how mask handling is set up initially. The `NDDataRef` class, being a subclass of `NDData`, inherits this setup and is involved in the arithmetic operations reported to fail. These code spans provide the necessary context to investigate and potentially modify the mask handling to address the reported issue. Given the information provided, the search task can be considered complete as the identified code spans are directly related to the functionality under question. Further investigation into the specific arithmetic operations and mask handling within these classes would be necessary to implement a fix.",

The goal is to identify the code spans responsible for handling these operations and the mask propagation. The issue specifically mentions that when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, it fails when one of the operands has a `NoneType` mask. The provided search results include multiple methods and utility functions in `NDArithmeticMixin`, which is likely involved in the arithmetic operations and mask handling. The focus should be on methods that deal with arithmetic operations and mask handling, such as `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and specifically on the `multiply` method, which is used in the example provided in the issue description. By examining these methods, we can determine if the mask handling logic correctly addresses operands with `NoneType` masks. The identified code spans should provide insights into how masks are propagated and how to handle cases where masks are `None`.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
