This setup directly addresses the mask propagation issue since NDArithmeticMixin is responsible for handling arithmetic operations including mask handling. The specific mask handling logic using `np.bitwise_or` within `multiply` and other arithmetic methods will need to be implemented inside NDArithmeticMixin. Additionally, the provided example uses `multiply` with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, which suggests that the relevant code for handling masks during arithmetic operations is indeed within the scope of NDArithmeticMixin. Given the context, it is reasonable to expect that the implementation details for handling masks during arithmetic operations in NDDataRef are managed within the NDArithmeticMixin class, which is included in the inheritance list of NDDataRef. However, the actual implementation of the `bitwise_or` handling for mask propagation within the methods of NDArithmeticMixin is not exposed in the provided context.

The error occurs because the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's, leading to a TypeError when attempting bitwise_or on an integer and a None. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle mask propagation and arithmetic operations.\n\nFrom the search results, the class `NDArithmeticMixin` in `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` appears to be the key component handling arithmetic operations. Specifically, the method `_arithmetic_mask` is responsible for managing mask operations during arithmetic. This method checks if either operand has a mask and applies the `handle_mask` function, which defaults to `np.logical_or`. The issue likely arises within this method when one of the masks is `None`.\n\nGiven this context, the identified code spans include `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` and potentially other methods that might interact with mask handling, such as `_arithmetic` and `multiply`. These spans define the core logic for arithmetic operations and mask handling, making them crucial for resolving the reported issue.\n\nThe task is complete as we have identified the relevant files and code spans that address the reported issue with mask propagation in arithmetic operations.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n"
