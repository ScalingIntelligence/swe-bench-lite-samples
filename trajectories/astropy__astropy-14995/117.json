The primary concern is that the operation fails due to a TypeError when an integer and a NoneType are operands for bitwise_or. The relevant section of the codebase that specifically addresses mask handling during arithmetic is `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask`. This method is critical as it determines the resulting mask during arithmetic operations based on the masks of the operands. The method has conditional logic to handle scenarios where either operand or both operands do not have masks, which seems to be the root cause of the reported issue. Given the issue description, it suggests that the mask handling logic needs adjustment to ensure that operations proceed smoothly when one operand lacks a mask. The identified code span directly relates to the problem described and is likely where a fix needs to be implemented to handle NoneType masks appropriately, ensuring they do not lead to TypeError during operations like bitwise_or.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
