The error indicates a TypeError when using np.bitwise_or on an integer and a NoneType. The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output when one operand lacks a mask. To address this, it's important to investigate the NDArithmeticMixin class, particularly the _arithmetic_mask method, as it is involved in handling masks during arithmetic operations. Additionally, looking into the NDDataRef class and how it interacts with NDArithmeticMixin is crucial.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
