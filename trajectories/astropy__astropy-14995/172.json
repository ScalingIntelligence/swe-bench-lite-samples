The search results provide the relevant class NDArithmeticMixin in 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py'. Notably, the method '_arithmetic_mask' is designed to handle mask operations during arithmetic, which is directly related to the issue. This method checks for the presence of masks and delegates the handling to the provided 'handle_mask' function, which in this case is 'np.bitwise_or'. This method needs to be examined and possibly adjusted to ensure that it correctly handles cases where one operand has a mask and the other does not, avoiding the TypeError by ensuring that NoneType is not involved in bitwise operations. Furthermore, the '_arithmetic' method, which orchestrates arithmetic operations, including mask handling, should also be reviewed to ensure comprehensive handling of such scenarios across all arithmetic operations. This initial focus on these methods should address the issue described and facilitate further investigation and potential adjustments to the codebase if necessary.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
