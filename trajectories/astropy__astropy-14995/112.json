The specific error is a 'TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'' during arithmetic operations with 'handle_mask=np.bitwise_or'. This issue did not occur in version 5.2. The task is to identify the relevant code responsible for mask handling during arithmetic operations. The provided context suggests that related files are primarily in the 'astropy/nddata/' directory, with focus on classes like NDDataArray, NDArithmeticMixin, and MaskedNDArray. The main goal is to find the specific code that handles mask operations with 'np.bitwise_or' and may be causing the error due to operations involving NoneType masks.",

The error occurs specifically with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, likely due to attempting bitwise operations between integers and None. The relevant code spans should focus on the mask handling during arithmetic operations, particularly in methods like `multiply`, which was used in the provided example. The identified code spans in `NDArithmeticMixin` and `NDDataArray` classes include methods for arithmetic operations and mask handling. The `_arithmetic_mask` method is of particular interest as it deals directly with mask propagation and could be where the error occurs if improper handling of None masks is present. Additionally, the `multiply` method serves as a concrete example of an arithmetic operation relevant to the issue. For completeness, other arithmetic methods like `add`, `subtract`, and `divide` should also be considered, even if not directly mentioned in the issue, as they likely follow similar mask handling logic. Furthermore, the `NDDataArray` class contains setter and getter methods for the mask property, which could also be relevant to understanding how masks are managed and potentially propagated or handled incorrectly.",
