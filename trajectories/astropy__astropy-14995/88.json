Upon inspection of the provided files, the classes NDArithmeticMixin and NDDataRef seem to be directly related to the arithmetic operations involving NDData. The error is specifically occurring in the context of arithmetic operations when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, which suggests that the problem might lie in how masks are handled during these operations. To narrow down the exact location of the problem, a detailed search is required focusing on NDArithmeticMixin and the handling of mask operations. Additionally, since the issue is specific to version 5.3, it's important to verify changes in the attributes or methods of NDDataRef between versions 5.2 and 5.3.",

The new search results in nddata_withmixins.py confirm the relationship and usage of NDArithmeticMixin within the NDDataRef class.

The methods within this class, such as `_arithmetic`, control how operations are performed, including how masks are handled. The operation_ignores_mask parameter plays a crucial role in deciding how masks are propagated and handled, especially in conjunction with numpy's bitwise operations like np.bitwise_or. Additionally, the methods `multiply`, `add`, `subtract`, and `divide` in NDArithmeticMixin all internally call `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`, which in turn invokes `_arithmetic`. This structured approach ensures that all manner of arithmetic operations are handled uniformly, with specific attention to mask propagation. Furthermore, looking at the NDDataRef class, it is clear that it leverages NDArithmeticMixin for its arithmetic operations, further emphasizing the critical role of NDArithmeticMixin in mask handling and propagation. Given this context, reviewing changes in the handling of np.bitwise_or in mask operations across v5.2 and v5.3, especially within the NDArithmeticMixin class, is imperative for understanding and resolving the mask propagation failure issue.",

The methods within this class, such as `_arithmetic`, control how operations are performed, including how masks are handled. The operation_ignores_mask parameter plays a crucial role in deciding how masks are propagated and handled, especially in conjunction with numpy's bitwise operations like np.bitwise_or. Additionally, the methods `multiply`, `add`, `subtract`, and `divide` in NDArithmeticMixin all internally call `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`, which in turn invokes `_arithmetic`. This structured approach ensures that all manner of arithmetic operations are handled uniformly, with specific attention to mask propagation. Furthermore, looking at the NDDataRef class, it is clear that it leverages NDArithmeticMixin for its arithmetic operations, further emphasizing the critical role of NDArithmeticMixin in mask handling and propagation. Given this context, reviewing changes in the handling of np.bitwise_or in mask operations across v5.2 and v5.3, especially within the NDArithmeticMixin class, is imperative for understanding and resolving the mask propagation failure issue.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
