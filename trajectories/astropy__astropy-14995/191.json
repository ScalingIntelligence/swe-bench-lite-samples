The '_arithmetic' method defines the general arithmetic operation, including the handling of masks with 'handle_mask'. The '_arithmetic_mask' method specifically deals with mask arithmetic operations, including the handling of None masks. The 'multiply' method, which is likely where the issue occurs based on the provided example, calls '_prepare_then_do_arithmetic', which in turn calls '_arithmetic'. These methods should be inspected to ensure proper handling of masks, especially when one or both operands might be None. Given the issue description, it's likely that the '_arithmetic_mask' method needs to be adjusted to handle the case where either self.mask or operand.mask is None safely. Also, the '_arithmetic' method's handling of 'handle_mask' should be reviewed to prevent the TypeError mentioned in the issue.",

Specifically, when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, the operation fails if one of the operands has a `None` mask, resulting in a `TypeError`. This issue does not occur in previous versions (v5.2), indicating a regression.\n\nThe provided file context from `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` directly relates to the issue. The `NDArithmeticMixin` class contains methods for arithmetic operations including `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and `multiply`, which handle mask propagation and arithmetic operations. The `_arithmetic_mask` method checks if either operand's mask is `None` and returns the other operand's mask if one is `None`. This current implementation does not handle the `bitwise_or` operation with `None` types gracefully.\n\nThe new search results include additional context for the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, specifically the `_arithmetic_mask` method which is critical for handling masks during arithmetic operations. The logic in `_arithmetic_mask` currently does not account for operations involving `None` masks and specific functions like `np.bitwise_or`. This omission likely results in the observed `TypeError` when performing arithmetic operations with a `None` mask.\n\nTo fix the issue, the `_arithmetic_mask` method must be updated to handle cases where `handle_mask` is `np.bitwise_or` and one of the masks is `None`. A potential solution could involve defining a mask of zeros (or another appropriate default mask) when encountering a `None` mask before applying the `bitwise_or` operation.

Following the provided implementation, there is a specific section of code within `_arithmetic_mask` that deals with the situation where one of the masks is `None`. However, it is not explicitly handling the bitwise operations with a `NoneType`. The method returns `None` if both masks are `None` or if `handle_mask` is explicitly set to `None`. In cases where one mask is `None` but the other is not, it returns the mask that is not `None`. This approach does not address the potential risk of a `TypeError` when a bitwise operation such as `np.bitwise_or` is applied with a `NoneType`. Therefore, it seems necessary to adjust this method to include validations or default values that prevent bitwise operations on `NoneType`.",

The expected behavior is that when one of the operands does not have a mask, the existing mask should be copied over to the output or behave as it did in v5.2. The provided code spans in the search results include the methods `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and `multiply` from the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, which handle arithmetic operations, mask handling, and specific multiplication operations, respectively. These methods are directly relevant to the issue as they deal with the propagation and handling of masks during arithmetic operations, where the failure occurs. The analysis of these methods shows that the current implementation does not handle the case where one operand has a mask and the other does not, which leads to the TypeError when attempting to perform a bitwise OR operation between an integer and None. This suggests that the relevant code spans are indeed those that deal with mask handling and arithmetic operations within the NDArithmeticMixin class.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n"
