The problem seems to arise because the operation tries to apply `bitwise_or` between an integer and a `None` type, which leads to a `TypeError`. The relevant code spans in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class relate to the handling of masks during arithmetic operations. The '_arithmetic_mask' method is particularly relevant as it directly deals with how masks are propagated and combined during arithmetic operations. This method checks for the presence of masks in the operands and decides how to proceed based on whether the masks are `None` or present. Based on the issue description, it is crucial to ensure that when one operand lacks a mask, the arithmetic operation does not attempt to operate on a `None` type, and instead, should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by copying the mask from the other operand or treating `None` masks appropriately. The provided code spans in `NDArithmeticMixin` give a good foundation to trace the logic and modify the code to address this issue.
