Also, the Masked and MaskedNDArray classes should be checked for how they handle None masks and arithmetic operations.",

This is specifically related to how the mask is handled in arithmetic operations with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. The issue suggests that in v5.2, this wasn't a problem, implying a change in behavior between versions that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe search results from `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` are highly relevant, as they contain the `NDArithmeticMixin` class which deals with arithmetic operations, including those related to mask handling. The spans identified include methods like `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and specific arithmetic operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`). These methods directly relate to how arithmetic operations are performed, likely including mask propagation which is the main issue described. The `_arithmetic_mask` method, in particular, shows how masks are handled during operations, which aligns with the reported issue.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the identified spans from `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` should be sufficient to start addressing the mask propagation issue. Additional spans may need to be identified if deeper analysis of related code segments is required, but for now, the identified spans seem relevant and sufficient for addressing the immediate issue.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
