The provided search results contain two relevant files: 'astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py' and 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py'. The first file defines the `NDDataRef` class, which includes `NDArithmeticMixin`, `NDIOMixin`, and `NDSlicingMixin`. The second file contains the implementation of `NDArithmeticMixin`, which includes the method `_arithmetic_mask` responsible for handling masks during arithmetic operations and the `multiply` method, which uses `_arithmetic_mask`. The issue likely lies within the `_arithmetic_mask` method, specifically how it handles scenarios where one of the operands does not have a mask. The relevant code spans are the definition of `NDArithmeticMixin` and the `_arithmetic_mask` method itself, as these are directly related to the mask handling during arithmetic operations.",

The primary concern involves the TypeError encountered when performing operations like multiplication, where one operand has a mask and the other does not. The issue seems to arise from attempting to perform a bitwise OR operation between an integer and a None type. The expected behavior is that the mask should be intelligently handled, possibly by copying over the existing mask or by treating the unmasked operand as having a mask of zeros, avoiding any operation that could lead to type errors. The current file context already provides the _arithmetic_mask method from NDArithmeticMixin, which specifically handles mask calculations but appears to incorrectly handle cases where one operand's mask is None, which might be the root cause of the issue. In the search results, there are multiple methods in NDArithmeticMixin that could be relevant to addressing this issue, including _arithmetic_data, _arithmetic_uncertainty, and the arithmetic operations themselves (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Each of these methods interacts with the mask and data of the operands, thus they need to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure proper handling of masks during arithmetic operations, especially when one of the operands lacks a mask. The _arithmetic method, which orchestrates the arithmetic operations, also needs to be examined for how it handles the mask propagation through the handle_mask parameter, which defaults to np.logical_or and might be causing the issue when dealing with None masks.",

The key elements from the issue are: 1) The mask propagation should handle the case where one operand does not have a mask. 2) The expected behavior is to copy over the existing mask or handle it similarly to how it was done in v5.2. 3) The reproduction of the issue involves the multiplication operation (multiply method) using np.bitwise_or as the handle_mask option, which fails due to the TypeError involving an integer and a NoneType. From the provided code spans, I see that the _arithmetic method is central to handling these operations and includes sections dealing with mask handling, specifically the _arithmetic_mask method and the mask updates within the _arithmetic method. These are directly relevant to ensuring proper mask propagation. Additionally, the multiply method is also relevant as it is the specific operation where the issue occurs.

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n"
