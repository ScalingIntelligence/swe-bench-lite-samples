The key areas in the code responsible for handling mask operations during arithmetic are the _arithmetic method and the _arithmetic_mask method within the NDArithmeticMixin class. The _arithmetic method orchestrates the arithmetic operations, including how masks are handled (optionally through np.logical_or), and the _arithmetic_mask method specifically deals with the calculations of the resulting mask. The relevant parts of the code involve checking if either operand's mask is None and handling these cases during mask propagation. Given the issue, the focus should be on refining the mask handling logic in these methods to ensure that operations proceed appropriately even when one operand lacks a mask, potentially by defining a default mask or adjusting the logic to handle NoneType masks more gracefully.",

Therefore, I believe all relevant code identified so far is sufficient for handling the reported issue related to mask propagation when one of the operands does not have a mask.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
