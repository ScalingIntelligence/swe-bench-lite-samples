The key problem described is that the operation `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails when attempting to operate on integers and NoneTypes. The solution expected is for the mask to be copied over to the output if one operand doesn't have a mask, similar to how it worked in v5.2.\n\nIn the search results, the relevant code is primarily found in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class within the `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` file. The methods `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask` are especially relevant as they deal directly with arithmetic operations and mask handling. These methods are responsible for handling the masks during arithmetic operations and could be the source of the issue described. The methods `multiply`, `add`, `subtract`, and `divide` are also relevant since they are the arithmetic operations where mask handling fails, as demonstrated in the report examples.\n\nGiven these findings, it is clear that the identified sections provide a comprehensive view of how the arithmetic operations and mask handling are implemented within the NDDataRef class in the astropy package. Therefore, these code spans are relevant to addressing the mask propagation issue mentioned in the reported problem.",

This is addressed in the _arithmetic_mask method within the NDArithmeticMixin class. The method determines how to handle masks during arithmetic operations, including cases where one operand lacks a mask. The code checks if a mask exists and propagates it accordingly. However, it does not handle the specific case where an arithmetic operation like np.bitwise_or encounters a NoneType, which is consistent with the reported issue. The method would benefit from an additional check to prevent TypeError when a NoneType is encountered.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
