The TypeError indicates that the bitwise_or operation is attempting to operate on an integer and a None, leading to the failure. The expected behavior is that when one operand does not have a mask, the existing mask should be copied over to the output, similar to v5.2 behavior.\n\nFrom the file context, it's evident that the issue is most likely related to the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, particularly the `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask` methods. The `_arithmetic` method handles the arithmetic operations and includes the logic for handling masks using `handle_mask`. The `_arithmetic_mask` method specifically deals with the mask handling logic during arithmetic operations.\n\nIn the new search results, the `NDDataRef` class in `astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py` confirms that `NDDataRef` inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, reinforcing the initial suspicion that the problem lies within the arithmetic mixin. The `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask` methods in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class are also found in the new search results, showing the same logic as in the file context. These methods handle the mask propagation logic and use `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` as specified in the issue. The `multiply` method, which is also part of the mixin, uses the `_arithmetic` method for its operations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans are identified in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, focusing on the `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask` methods where the mask handling logic is defined. These spans are likely where the fix needs to be applied to address the issue of mask propagation when one operand does not have a mask.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
