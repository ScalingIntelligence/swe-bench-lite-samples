This class inherits from several mixins including `NDArithmeticMixin`, which suggests that this mixin could potentially handle arithmetic operations involving masks. Given the issue description, it is likely that the problem originates from how `NDArithmeticMixin` manages mask handling when one operand is missing a mask.\n\nWhile the search results do not provide the exact code implementing `np.bitwise_or`, the inheritance structure strongly implies that the arithmetic operations' mask handling is likely implemented within `NDArithmeticMixin`.

This failure occurs specifically with the use of np.bitwise_or for handling masks. An error arises when np.bitwise_or attempts to operate on an integer and None, indicating that a mask of None is being assumed for the operand without a mask. The expected behavior described is that when an operand lacks a mask, the existing mask should be propagated to the output, as was the case in version 5.2. To address this issue, it is essential to identify the relevant sections within the NDArithmeticMixin class in the astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py file. This class contains the core arithmetic methods including handling of masks, data, uncertainties, and metadata. The methods _arithmetic, _arithmetic_mask, and _prepare_then_do_arithmetic are crucial to review, as they involve the logic for arithmetic operations, how masks are handled, and how the arithmetic is prepared and executed. By examining these methods, it becomes clear that the current handling of masks is not adequately addressing the scenario where an operand might be missing a mask, which leads to the TypeError encountered in version 5.3. The identified code spans directly deal with this issue and should be the focus for any necessary updates.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
