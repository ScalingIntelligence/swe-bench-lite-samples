The TypeError specifically points to an incompatibility between 'int' and 'NoneType' when using `np.bitwise_or` to handle mask propagation. The relevant files identified are 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' and 'astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py'. The most pertinent code spans involve the `_arithmetic_mask` method in the NDArithmeticMixin class, which handles mask propagation, and the `multiply` method, which is where the issue manifests. To address the issue, modifications should be made to ensure that if an operand lacks a mask, it is appropriately handled to avoid TypeError. The existing logic in `_arithmetic_mask` does not account for operations involving a mask and a non-mask (None) directly, which is causing the error. An adjustment is needed to handle None masks explicitly, possibly by defining a behavior where None masks are treated as fully transparent (or opaque) for the operation. This way, the operation can proceed withoutTypeError, ensuring that the existing mask, when present, is correctly propagated to the result. Additionally, the `NDDataRef` class inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, confirming its relevance to the reported issue.",

The method _arithmetic_mask is responsible for handling masks during these operations. The issue describes a failure in mask propagation when one operand does not have a mask, and this is handled in the _arithmetic_mask method, where it checks for None masks and tries to copy the existing mask over to the output or handle the operation as needed. The multiply method, which is also present, calls _prepare_then_do_arithmetic, which likely uses _arithmetic_mask for mask handling. Therefore, the provided file context contains the necessary code to understand and potentially fix the issue related to mask propagation.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
