This results in a `TypeError` from attempting to use `np.bitwise_or` on an integer and `None`. The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output when one operand lacks a mask, similar to the behavior in v5.2. Given the code spans provided, the relevant sections appear to be within the `NDArithmeticMixin` class. Specifically, the methods `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, `multiply`, and the class definition `NDDataRef` are pertinent. The `_arithmetic` method is where the arithmetic operations are processed, including handling of masks with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. The `_arithmetic_mask` method handles the logic for combining masks, which includes cases where masks might be `None`. Together, these sections of code determine how masks are propagated and processed during arithmetic operations in `NDDataRef`. The `multiply` method is particularly relevant as it directly relates to the operation described in the issue. Reviewing and potentially modifying `_arithmetic_mask` and `_arithmetic` would be crucial to address the mask propagation issue, ensuring that `None` masks are appropriately handled without causing `TypeError`.",

This leads to a TypeError when attempting bitwise operations between an integer and None. To address this, the focus should be on the NDArithmeticMixin class within the astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py file, particularly on the _arithmetic_mask method and the _arithmetic method. The _arithmetic_mask method is crucial for determining mask handling in arithmetic operations. In the provided code, it doesn't explicitly handle cases where one operand's mask is None, which is likely causing the error. The _arithmetic method sets the mask for the result, but current code suggests it might not be accounting for cases where one mask might be None (implicitly treated as no mask), leading to the error. Therefore, the code span that handles mask operations during arithmetic (ID: NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask) and the overall arithmetic operation handling (ID: NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic) in the astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py file are identified as relevant.",

The previous inspection of the `_arithmetic` method revealed its role in arithmetic operations, including mask propagation. The `handle_mask` parameter within this method determines how masks are combined, and the `_arithmetic_mask` method is dedicated to dealing with mask combinations. Notably, the `_arithmetic` method contains logic to handle cases where one mask is `None`, but there's no specific handling for when `np.bitwise_or` is used. To deepen understanding, it's crucial to find other methods or parts of the codebase that utilize these functions, as they might provide insights into how mask propagation is managed across different contexts or operations.",

The code checks for the presence of masks and applies the specified operation (`handle_mask`).\n\n2. `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` - This method specifically deals with the mask calculations during arithmetic operations. It checks if the masks are `None` and applies the specified operation to combine them.\n\n3. `NDArithmeticMixin.multiply` - This method is used to perform multiplication operations and is relevant because the issue includes examples of multiplication with and without masks.\n\nGiven the issue's description, the key areas of focus are the handling of `None` masks and the application of `np.bitwise_or` to combine mask values. The method `_arithmetic_mask` directly deals with these aspects and is likely where the error occurs when one operand has a `None` mask. The relevant code spans are those that deal with mask handling and specifically with the `_arithmetic_mask` method. By examining and potentially modifying this method, the issue of mask propagation failure can be addressed by ensuring that `None` masks do not cause operations to fail but instead propagate appropriately.",

The method _arithmetic_mask explicitly handles two cases: one where both self.mask and operand.mask are None, and another where only one of them has a mask. This suggests that the relevant code to manage the mask propagation in various scenarios is covered. Furthermore, the methods cover different operations like multiplication, indicating that the essential arithmetic and mask propagation functionalities are addressed within these methods, which should be sufficient to implement the expected behavior described in the issue.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
