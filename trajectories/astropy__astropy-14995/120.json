This causes a `TypeError` due to a bitwise OR operation between an integer and `NoneType`. The search results include a method `_arithmetic` in `NDArithmeticMixin` which handles arithmetic operations including mask handling. The method `_arithmetic_mask` is specifically responsible for handling the mask during arithmetic operations. Analyzing these methods, it's clear that the current implementation does not handle the scenario where one operand's mask is `None` gracefully. Specifically, in `_arithmetic_mask`, when `self.mask` is `None` and `operand.mask` is not `None`, it correctly returns a deep copy of `operand.mask`. However, if both masks are `None`, it returns `None`, which doesn't handle the situation where `handle_mask` is `np.bitwise_or`. This leads to the error described in the issue as `np.bitwise_or` tries to operate on an integer and a `NoneType`. The solution might involve adding a check in `_arithmetic_mask` to return a mask that avoids `None` types before applying `np.bitwise_or`. These methods (`_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask`) are central to the issue and need to be addressed to fix the mask propagation problem.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
