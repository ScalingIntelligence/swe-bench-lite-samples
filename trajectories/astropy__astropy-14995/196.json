The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied to the output when one operand lacks a mask. From the provided search results, it's clear that the relevant code is in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class in the `ndarithmetic.py` file. The `_arithmetic` method and its associated methods (`_arithmetic_mask`, `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) are critical for understanding how mask propagation is handled. In particular, the `_arithmetic_mask` method has logic that deals with the merging of masks, which appears to be where the issue lies. This method currently does not handle the case where one mask is None, which results in the TypeError.

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
