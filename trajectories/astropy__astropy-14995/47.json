The search results from 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' provide several relevant code spans including '_arithmetic', '_arithmetic_data', '_arithmetic_uncertainty', and '_arithmetic_mask'. The '_arithmetic_mask' method seems particularly relevant as it handles the mask during arithmetic operations and directly addresses the issue of combining masks, including scenarios where one operand lacks a mask. The method checks conditions for mask propagation and decides whether to return None, deepcopy one of the masks, or perform the specified operation (`np.bitwise_or` in this case) on the masks of both operands. This method directly matches the issue reported as it outlines how the mask is supposed to be handled during arithmetic with a mask and without a mask. To resolve the issue, modifications or corrections in this '_arithmetic_mask' method seem necessary. For example, ensuring that a mask of None is not incorrectly treated as an operand in bitwise operations. Additionally, '_arithmetic_uncertainty' does not immediately address the current issue but is relevant for a complete understanding of arithmetic operations within NDDataRef. The search task is likely incomplete as there might be other sections in the codebase, such as tests or additional methods, that could be relevant to understanding or resolving the issue fully.

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
