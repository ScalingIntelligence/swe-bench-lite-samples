The _arithmetic method contains logic to handle the mask, including copying the mask from one operand to the result if the other operand has no mask. The multiply method, which is also part of the NDArithmeticMixin class, uses the _arithmetic method and is therefore relevant to how the mask propagation issue might be addressed.

The relevant code sections for this issue are likely found in the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, particularly the `_arithmetic` and `_arithmetic_mask` methods. The `_arithmetic` method handles the main arithmetic operation and defines how masks are handled. The `_arithmetic_mask` method specifically deals with mask propagation and the application of `np.bitwise_or`. Both methods need to be examined to ensure they correctly handle cases where masks may be None. The provided search results include these methods, confirming they are the correct areas to focus on for addressing the issue. It is also worth noting the `multiply` method, which calls `_prepare_then_do_arithmetic`, which in turn uses `_arithmetic`, indicating the chain of operations involved in the arithmetic processes.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
