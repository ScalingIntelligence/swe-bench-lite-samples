The '_arithmetic' method within this class is responsible for performing arithmetic operations while handling masks and uncertainties. Errors occur when handling arithmetic operations involving operands with and without masks, specifically in the propagation of masks using 'np.bitwise_or'. The '_arithmetic_mask' method is also relevant as it calculates the resulting mask during arithmetic operations. The issue likely stems from how NoneType masks are treated when one operand lacks a mask. To fix this, we need to ensure that mask handling correctly accounts for operands without masks, possibly by treating None as an all-False mask or by implementing a conditional check to prevent operations involving NoneType and integers.",

However, there is no explicit handling for cases where one operand has a mask and the other does not have a mask. The current logic seems to assume both operands have masks or none do.

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
