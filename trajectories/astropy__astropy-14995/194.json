The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output when one of the operands lacks a mask, mirroring the behavior in v5.2 where this is not a problem. To address this, it's essential to identify the relevant code spans that handle mask operations during arithmetic, particularly focusing on where operands are checked for masks and how mask handling is implemented. The analysis of the search results shows that the `NDArithmeticMixin` class in 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' contains methods that are directly related to arithmetic operations and mask handling: `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and `_arithmetic_wcs`. Specifically, the `_arithmetic_mask` method is responsible for handling the mask during arithmetic operations, including the case where one operand might not have a mask. This method directly addresses the issue by defining what happens to the mask in different scenarios\u2014when neither operand has a mask, when one operand has a mask, and when both have masks. Thus, the identified code spans are relevant and sufficient to address the issue as they cover the core functionality implicated by the reported issue.",

However, the issue arises when the operation tries to perform bitwise operations on a NoneType and an integer. This points to a potential bug in how NoneType masks are handled in the arithmetic operations.

The reported issue involves mask propagation when one of the operands does not have a mask, leading to a TypeError during arithmetic operations with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`.

The current file context provides relevant code spans within `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`, specifically methods related to arithmetic operations and mask handling (`_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`).\n3. New search results expand on these methods, revealing additional methods like `_arithmetic_data`, `_arithmetic_uncertainty`, `_arithmetic_wcs`, and `_arithmetic_meta`. These methods handle different aspects of the arithmetic operation, but the issue at hand is primarily about mask handling.\n4. The most pertinent code spans are still within `NDArithmeticMixin`, specifically the `_arithmetic_mask` method where mask handling logic resides. The other methods are related but not directly addressing the reported issue.\n5. The `_arithmetic_mask` method checks conditions related to mask presence and operation, but it does not explicitly handle the case where one operand has a mask and the other does not, which could be causing the TypeError. This gap needs further attention.\n6. There are no new relevant code spans introduced in the additional search results that directly address the mask propagation issue when dealing with a None mask.

This problem arises specifically during arithmetic operations with 'handle_mask=np.bitwise_or' and results in a TypeError because the operation attempts to perform a bitwise OR between integers and None. The expected behavior is for the existing mask to be copied over to the output when one operand lacks a mask. To address this, focus should be on the '_arithmetic' method in the NDArithmeticMixin class, particularly on how the mask is handled and propagated. The 'ndarithmetic.py' file contains the code spans relevant to arithmetic operations and mask handling, including the '_arithmetic_mask' and '_arithmetic' methods. The '_arithmetic_mask' method is especially critical since it directly deals with the creation of the resulting mask based on the input masks. Additionally, the '_arithmetic' method calls '_arithmetic_mask' and sets up the conditions for mask handling. As these methods already exist in the provided file context, there seems to be completeness in terms of the code spans needed to resolve the issue. The provided search results further confirm this by including additional methods like '_arithmetic_data', '_arithmetic_uncertainty', '_arithmetic_wcs', '_arithmetic_meta', and methods for specific arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
