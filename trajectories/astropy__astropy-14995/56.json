Specifically, the error occurs when using `np.bitwise_or` to handle the mask and one operand has a mask of None. The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output or handled similar to v5.2 where there's no problem. From the provided search results, several code spans are relevant to this issue. The `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic` method defines how arithmetic operations are handled, including how masks are propagated. The `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` method specifically deals with how masks are combined during arithmetic operations. Since the issue mentioned `np.bitwise_or`, it's important to check how masks are handled in this context within these methods. The `NDArithmeticMixin._prepare_then_do_arithmetic` method also seems relevant as it prepares operands for arithmetic operations, which could involve setting masks or handling them appropriately. All these methods should be examined to ensure that the handling of masks, especially when one operand has a mask of None, is correctly managed to avoid TypeErrors.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
