The _arithmetic_mask method specifically deals with the management of masks during arithmetic operations, including the case when one operand does not have a mask. The NDDataRef class, which inherits from NDArithmeticMixin, is also provided in the context.

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
