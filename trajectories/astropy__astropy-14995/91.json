Specifically, the error occurs when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, which attempts to operate on an integer and a NoneType, leading to a TypeError. Given the context and referenced class names (NDDataRef, NDArithmeticMixin), it's essential to focus on these mixins and related methods responsible for arithmetic operations and mask handling. The context suggests that core functionality may not have fully grasped or intelligently dealt with NoneType masks in operations. Hence, targeted search should include 'NDArithmeticMixin', 'NDDataRef', and delve into methods handling mask arithmetic and bitwise operations, with a special focus on where NoneType treatment or defaulting to 'no mask' is expected but not properly managed.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the failure of mask propagation in NDDataRef when performing arithmetic operations with operands that lack masks, specifically when using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`. The error occurs because `np.bitwise_or` cannot operate on a mix of integers and NoneTypes. The expected behavior is that when one operand lacks a mask, the existing mask should be copied over to the output or handled as it was in v5.2 without errors.\n\nReviewing the search results, several code spans are relevant to the issue. The `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic` method is central as it defines the behavior of arithmetic operations, including how masks are handled. Specifically, the method sets up how masks are propagated and how the operation should behave when masks are involved. This method uses `handle_mask` to determine the operation on masks.\n\nFurther, the `NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic_mask` method directly addresses the handling of masks during arithmetic operations. It includes checks to see if masks exist and how to handle them when one operand lacks a mask. This method could be where the error arises if not properly handled.\n\nFinally, the `NDArithmeticMixin.multiply` method is relevant as it is the specific arithmetic operation being tested in the reported issue. Understanding how multiplication handles masks will be crucial for resolving the issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the mask propagation issue in NDDataRef.",

Specifically, it mentions that arithmetic operations with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fail when one operand's mask is None, causing a TypeError due to the bitwise operation trying to operate on an integer and a NoneType. In v5.2, this was handled correctly. The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output if one of the operands lacks a mask. I analyzed the context and search results, focusing particularly on how mask handling is implemented in the NDArithmeticMixin class. I identified several code spans relevant to the mask handling: the `_arithmetic` method where the overall arithmetic operation and its handling options are set, the `_arithmetic_mask` method where the mask for the operation is determined, and the specific arithmetic methods like `multiply` that are being used in the provided example. I confirmed that the mask handling logic could benefit from explicit checking for NoneType masks before applying the bitwise operation, to maintain backward compatibility and avoid TypeErrors. Furthermore, I reviewed the NDDataRef class to understand how it integrates with NDArithmeticMixin from an overall system standpoint.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n"
