The error arises due to an attempt to perform a bitwise OR operation between an integer and a NoneType, which indicates that the operand without a mask is being treated as a mask of None's. The solution likely involves adjusting how masks are handled in the arithmetic operations to ensure that None masks are appropriately managed to prevent such type errors. The relevant parts of the codebase seem to be in the `astropy/nddata` directory, particularly in files related to `NDData`, `NDDataRef`, `NDArithmeticMixin`, `NDSlicingMixin`, and `NDIOMixin`. These files contain the definitions and implementations of classes and methods that manage NDData objects, including their masks and arithmetic operations. Specifically, the identified spans include the definition of `NDDataRef` and its inheritance of `NDArithmeticMixin`, which is likely where the mask handling in arithmetic operations is defined. Additionally, the `__init__` methods for `NDData` and `NDDataArray` reveal how masks are initialized and handled when an `NDData` object is instantiated. The `mask` property in these classes is also relevant as it defines how masks are accessed and possibly modified. Given the complexity and interconnectedness of these components, a thorough review of all related code spans is necessary to determine the exact location and nature of the adjustments needed to resolve the mask propagation issue.",

Specifically, the bitwise_or operation fails when trying to operate on an integer and a None. The goal is to understand how mask propagation is handled in the arithmetic operations and identify the relevant code spans that might be causing this issue. From the provided context and search results, key areas to focus on include the `NDArithmeticMixin` class and its methods, particularly `_arithmetic`, `_arithmetic_mask`, and operations like `multiply` that involve mask handling. The expected behavior is that if one operand does not have a mask, the existing mask should be copied over to the output, mimicking the behavior from v5.2. The current context already shows relevant files like `astropy/nddata/nddata.py` and `astropy/nddata/compat.py`, which define the `NDData` and `NDDataArray` classes, including their mask handling properties. The search results from `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` provide deeper insights into how arithmetic operations are implemented, especially the mask handling logic in the `_arithmetic_mask` method. This method is crucial because it directly deals with how the masks of two operands are combined, which is at the core of the reported issue.",

This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.
