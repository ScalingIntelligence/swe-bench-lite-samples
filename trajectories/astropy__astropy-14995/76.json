The issue arises when one of the operands does not have a mask, leading to a TypeError when performing the bitwise OR operation between an integer and a NoneType. This behavior is only occurring in version 5.3, not in version 5.2. The relevant files in the search results would be those under `astropy/nddata/`, specifically `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` and `astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py`. Upon analysis: \n\ndata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py: This file defines the class `NDArithmeticMixin`, which includes methods for arithmetic operations, including handling of masks (`_arithmetic_mask` method). The `_arithmetic_mask` method checks for the presence of masks in the operands and decides how to handle them. It seems to be the central place where the change should be implemented.\n\nastropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py: This file defines the `NDDataRef` class, which inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, among others. This structure indicates that instances of `NDDataRef` should use the mask handling logic defined in `NDArithmeticMixin`. \n\nRegarding the search task's completeness, these identified parts of the code should provide enough context to understand and fix the mask propagation issue. However, to ensure the fix correctly propagates the mask in the specified manner when one operand is missing a mask, it would be good to identify or implement a new function or augmentation in the `_arithmetic_mask` method within `NDArithmeticMixin` to adhere to the expected behaviors specified in the report.",

The main problem arises when one of the operands does not have a mask, causing a TypeError due to the attempted operation on an integer and a NoneType. The goal is to ensure that the mask that exists is copied over to the output when one operand lacks a mask, mimicking the behavior of v5.2 where there are no errors.\n\nThe current file context and search results provide several key pieces of information. The `NDArithmeticMixin` class contains the method `_arithmetic_mask` which handles the propagation of masks during arithmetic operations. This method checks if the mask is None for self or the operand and handles it accordingly.\n\nIn the search results, the `_arithmetic` method within `NDArithmeticMixin` is the main function that orchestrates arithmetic operations, including mask handling. This method calls `_arithmetic_mask` to handle mask propagation, which aligns with the issue in focus. Additionally, the `NDDataRef` class, as per the file context, inherits from `NDArithmeticMixin`, indicating that instances of NDDataRef would use these methods for mask handling.\n\nGiven this, the identified code spans are directly related to the handle_mask behavior during arithmetic operations in NDData, particularly how each operand's mask is processed and combined. The primary goal is to ensure that operations can proceed correctly even when one operand lacks a mask, and this is addressed by the identified methods within `NDArithmeticMixin`.",

The issue is that when performing arithmetic operations with handle_mask=np.bitwise_or, it fails if one operand has a mask of None, resulting in a TypeError. The expected behavior is that the existing mask should be copied over to the output or handled in a way that it did not cause issues in v5.2.\n\nFrom the file_context, the relevant code is located in 'astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py' and 'astropy/nddata/nddata_withmixins.py'. The problematic method is '_arithmetic_mask' in the NDArithmeticMixin class which handles the mask propagation during arithmetic operations. This method currently has conditions to handle cases where either self.mask or operand.mask is None, but it seems it does not handle the case where the bitwise_or operation is requested (handle_mask=np.bitwise_or) and one of the masks is None.\n\nIn the search_results, the same method '_arithmetic_mask' appears again, confirming that this is indeed the method responsible for handling masks during arithmetic operations. It includes the logic to return None if both masks are None or to copy the existing mask if only one is None. However, the expected behavior when one mask is None and bitwise_or is used is not explicitly handled in the found code spans.\n\nTo fix the issue, it is necessary to modify '_arithmetic_mask' to correctly handle the situation when one operand does not have a mask and the operation is bitwise_or. This might involve explicitly checking for None and applying a different behavior when bitwise_or is the requested operation.",

  "initial_message": "In v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.
