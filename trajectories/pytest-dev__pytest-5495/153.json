            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns a confusing assertion rewriting message when dealing with byte strings in pytest. The specific confusion arises from the comparison of byte strings in the assertion output, where the ASCII ordinal of a character is shown as part of the error message rather than a more interpretable format. This issue seems to involve the assertion rewriting mechanism in pytest, particularly the comparison logic for `==` when both operands are byte strings (or possibly any sequence type). The `assertrepr_compare` function seems to be the central point for customizing the representation for pytest assertion statements, making it highly relevant. Within this function, the logic for byte string comparison is handled in the `_diff_text` function (triggered when `op == '=='` and `istext(left)` and `istext(right)`). This function utilizes the `difflib.ndiff` to compute differences, which might be causing the less human-readable output for byte strings. Other related functions include `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls`, which handle different types of comparisons (lists, sets, dicts, and dataclasses/attrs respectively) and seem less directly related to byte string comparison. Given the nature of the issue, it makes sense to focus on spans related to byte string handling. Span id 'assertrepr_compare' and '_diff_text' are chosen as directly relevant. The 'escape_for_readable_diff' function within '_diff_text' might be particularly important, as it deals with string representations of binary data, likely influencing the readability of comparison outputs. This approach omits spans related to comparing other types like lists, sets, dicts, and classes directly since they are extraneous to the issue concerning byte strings.",

Specifically, there is no function '_compare_eq_sequence' or similar that directly addresses the issue of presenting byte string differences in a clearer way. Without detailed guidance on how to integrate such a change into the code's current structure or a template of how the desired output should look, it's not feasible to implement this change accurately or effectively. Therefore, the request to modify the function '_compare_eq_sequence' cannot be fulfilled without additional context or specifications.",
