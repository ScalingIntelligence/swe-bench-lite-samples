The example provided shows how the assertion error message is displayed when comparing empty byte strings with non-empty ones. The confusion stems from the message showing ASCII ordinals (like 52 for '4') instead of the actual byte values. This issue seems to be related to the logic in the AssertionRewriter class which is responsible for rewriting assertions in the code. Specifically, the visit_Compare method of this class could be handling byte string comparisons. Given this, it is plausible that the resolution to the reported issue would involve modifying methods in the AssertionRewriter class, particularly those involved in generating comparison explanations (like visit_Compare), to better handle byte strings and potentially adjust the message format to be more clear and intuitive for users.",

The examples provided clearly show the confusion in the error messages where the ASCII ordinal of a byte is shown rather than a more human-readable format. The focus is on improving the assertion rewriting process specifically for byte string comparisons. From the <file_context> and <search_results>, it's evident that the code involves 'AssertionRewriter' class and methods like 'visit_Compare' and '_call_reprcompare' that handle the comparison and assertion rewriting. These methods are crucial as they directly deal with the comparisons and generating the assertions messages. Therefore, they should be reviewed and possibly modified to handle byte strings better, by either changing the comparison method or enhancing the error message generation. The methods '_format_assertmsg' and '_call_reprcompare' are the likely candidates for modifications due to their direct interaction with the assertion messages and comparison operations. It's important to ensure that any changes made here do not negatively impact other types of comparisons and assertions.",
