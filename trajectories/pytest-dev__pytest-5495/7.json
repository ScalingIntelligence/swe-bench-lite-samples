The user provided examples where the assertion error message is unclear when comparing empty byte strings with non-empty byte strings, especially with the ASCII ordinal values mentioned in the error message. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the comparison and representation of byte strings in assertion errors. The search results include several functions that are likely relevant, such as assertrepr_compare, _diff_text, _compare_eq_sequence, and _compare_eq_iterable, as they directly deal with comparison and diffing of different data types, including byte strings.\n\nThe `assertrepr_compare` function is particularly important as it determines the explanation for the comparison failure based on the type of the objects being compared. It calls `_diff_text` when both objects are text or byte strings, which is directly relevant to the reported issue. The `_compare_eq_sequence` and `_compare_eq_iterable` functions also handle comparisons of sequences, which could include byte strings. These functions will need to be reviewed to ensure that the comparison and error messages for byte strings are clear and understandable.\n\nGiven the context of the issue, the identified spans are likely relevant to resolving the confusion around byte string comparison in assertion rewriting. Specifically, the spans related to `assertrepr_compare`, `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, and `_compare_eq_iterable` should be further examined and potentially modified to improve the clarity of the error messages for byte string comparisons.",
