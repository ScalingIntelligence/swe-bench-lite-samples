To address this, we should focus on the code responsible for generating these assertion messages. Given the file context, 'pytest_assertrepr_compare' in '_pytest/assertion/__init__.py' is set to 'util.assertrepr_compare'. This suggests that 'util.py' is where the main assertion handling for comparisons happens. In the search results, 'assertrepr_compare' function is central as it decides how to handle and display different types of comparisons. Specifically, the '_diff_text' function is relevant as it handles comparison of text and byte strings. This function correctly identifies and escapes binary text and provides a detailed diff, which could be enhanced or adjusted to improve the clarity of the byte string comparisons in assertion errors. Therefore, the key areas to focus on are the '_diff_text' function for detailed handling of byte string differences and 'assertrepr_compare' for overall comparison logic.",
