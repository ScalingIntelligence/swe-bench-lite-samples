The relevant functions to investigate in the search results are those related to assertion comparison and byte string handling in the assertion rewriting utility. Looking at the search results, the function `assertrepr_compare` seems central as it handles the representation of comparison results, including type-specific comparison strategies. This function calls `_diff_text`, which is specifically designed to handle differences between text types, including byte strings. Given this, the relevant code spans would be `assertrepr_compare` and `_diff_text`, especially as they relate to how byte strings are processed and compared in the assertion rewriting framework. These functions directly address the comparison of byte strings and their representation in the assertion error messages, which aligns with the user's concern about confusion with byte string comparisons.",

For byte strings specifically, the `_diff_text` function is used, which handles detailed comparison and potentially formats the output differently for byte strings. Additional investigation into how byte strings are explicitly handled in `_diff_text` and whether it can be improved for clarity is suggested. Furthermore, considering the assertion rewriting in `rewrite.py`, particularly the `AssertionRewriter` class and its involvement in transforming assert statements during runtime, might also provide insights into how assertions involving byte strings are processed and represented.

The search results contain relevant sections from the `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` file, specifically focusing on the `assertrepr_compare` function and related helper functions such as `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, and others. These functions handle the comparison and representation of differing items, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Additionally, the `_diff_text` function handles the escaping and diffing of byte strings, which is crucial for understanding the issue. The `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file contains the `AssertionRewriter` class, which is involved in the rewriting of assert statements during test execution. This class and its methods are also relevant, particularly `visit_Assert` and `visit_Compare`, as they manage the assertion rewriting process and comparison handling, respectively. Therefore, the provided search results greatly assist in understanding and potentially resolving the issue related to confusing assertion rewriting messages for byte strings.",

This involves understanding and potentially modifying the `assertrepr_compare` function in `util.py` and the possibly related `AssertionRewriter` class in `rewrite.py`. The file context provided includes the `assertrepr_compare` function which is responsible for comparing and producing detailed explanations for assertions, including those involving byte strings. The function uses `_diff_text` for text comparisons, which involves handling byte strings. This function's logic for diffing byte strings, including the ASCII ordinal representation and detailed diff output, is present and might be the source of the confusion mentioned in the issue. Furthermore, the `AssertionRewriter` class in `rewrite.py` is also provided in the context, indicating it's involved in the runtime transformation of assert statements, potentially affecting how byte string assertions are processed and displayed. Given the detailed examination of the provided file context, it seems that the relevant sections for addressing the reported issue are indeed present.
