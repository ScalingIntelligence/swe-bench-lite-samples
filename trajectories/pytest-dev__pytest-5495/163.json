The examples provided show that when comparing byte strings, the assertion error message includes ASCII ordinal numbers, which can be confusing. The relevant code spans to focus on are those that handle comparison logic for byte strings, particularly in the context of assertion rewriting. The `assertrepr_compare` function in `util.py` is a central piece that handles the comparison explanation logic, including cases for byte strings. Additionally, the `_diff_text` function specifically addresses the text (or byte string) comparison in detail, which would likely need adjustments for clearer byte string comparison messages. Other functions like `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls` also involve comparison logic but might not directly address the byte string issue as closely as `assertrepr_compare` and `_diff_text`.",
