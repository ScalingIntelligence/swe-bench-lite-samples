The problem seems to be how the comparison is displayed when byte strings are involved.

The 'util.py', 'rewrite.py', and 'compat.py' files seem particularly relevant due to their involvement in assertion handling and string manipulation. Functions like 'assertrepr_compare', '_compare_eq_sequence', and 'ascii_escaped' could be key points to focus on.",

Specifically, the error messages for assertion failures involving byte strings are mentioned as being confusing. The provided search results include several functions from `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` that handle assertion comparisons, especially `assertrepr_compare` which is critical for generating detailed explanations for assertion failures. Within this function, there are checks for byte strings and detailed comparisons for sequences, sets, dictionaries, and more. The function `_diff_text` is particularly important as it handles the diff between text representations, which includes bytes. This function is essential for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior related to byte strings in assertion messages. The other functions like `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, etc., provide further context on how different types of comparisons are handled, which aids in understanding the broader context of the assertion rewriting mechanism. Based on the issue's focus on byte strings, the key functions `assertrepr_compare`, `_diff_text`, and potentially others that handle byte string comparisons should be considered for potential modifications or enhancements to improve the clarity of error messages.",
