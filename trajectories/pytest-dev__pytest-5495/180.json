The provided search results contain several functions and classes related to assertion rewriting and comparison. Specifically, the `assertrepr_compare` function handles the comparison of objects during assertions, and the `_diff_text` function specifically deals with comparing text or byte strings. Given the issue's focus on byte strings, these functions are directly relevant. Additionally, other functions like `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, and `_compare_eq_dict` handle detailed comparisons for sequences, sets, and dictionaries, which could also be relevant depending on the broader context of the codebase. The `AssertionRewriter` class is also pertinent as it initiates the assertion rewriting process, which is central to the issue. While the specific logic for dealing with byte string comparisons and generating clear error messages is found in `_diff_text`, understanding how the assertion rewriting process integrates with these functions in the broader `AssertionRewriter` class is crucial. This holistic understanding ensures we have a clear path for addressing the issue at hand.",
