This includes components from the assertion rewriting and utility modules.

Additionally, the broader context provided in 'assertrepr_compare' and its sub-functions like '_compare_eq_sequence', '_compare_eq_set', and '_compare_eq_dict' would also be necessary to ensure a holistic understanding of how different types, including byte strings, are compared.
