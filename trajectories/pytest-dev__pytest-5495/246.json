The examples provided show the assertion failure messages where byte strings are being compared, and the differences are expressed in terms of ASCII ordinals, which is not intuitive for users. To address this, we need to focus on the functions responsible for generating these comparison explanations, particularly where byte strings are handled.\n\nFrom the search results, the following functions are identified as relevant:\n- `assertrepr_compare`: This function is the main entry point for generating detailed comparison representations. It checks the type of `left` and `right` operands and delegates the comparison to specific functions if both are byte strings.\n- `_diff_text`: This function is used to generate a text diff for comparison explanations. It handles byte strings by converting them to a readable format and then performing a diff. Its handling of byte strings is of particular interest here, as it directly affects how byte strings are represented in failed assertions.\n- `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, `_compare_eq_cls`, and `_notin_text`: These functions are helper functions for generating more detailed explanations for different types of comparisons. While not directly related to byte strings, they contribute to the overall assertion rewriting functionality and understanding them aids in comprehending the entire system.\n\nConsidering the issue at hand, the primary focus should be on refining the `_diff_text` function to provide clearer representation of byte string differences. Currently, the function escapes binary text for a readable diff, but it might not be sufficient to address the user's confusion. Further improvements might involve adding additional context or using a more intuitive representation of byte differences.",
