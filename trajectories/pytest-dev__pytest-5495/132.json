The main concern is the confusing error message with ASCII ordinals and the ambiguity this introduces. The search results provide several functions that are part of the assertion rewriting and comparison logic, which are critical for understanding how byte string comparisons are handled and potentially for improving the error message clarity. The functions '_diff_text', '_compare_eq_sequence', and 'assertrepr_compare' are particularly relevant because they directly involve byte strings and provide mechanisms for textual and sequence comparison, including byte sequences. '_diff_text' has a specific focus on handling binary text comparisons and could be modified to improve readability of diffs involving byte strings. '_compare_eq_sequence' will also be useful for identifying specific differences in byte sequences. 'assertrepr_compare' is the entry point where the assertion results are formatted and where enhancements could be made to the error messages for byte string comparisons. These functions collectively help in diagnosing and potentially rectifying the issue described in the reported issue.",
