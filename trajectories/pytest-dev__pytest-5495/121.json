Specifically, the function `assertrepr_compare` is crucial as it determines the representation of the difference between the two objects, which is the core issue described. The function `_diff_text` is also relevant because it handles the diffing process for text and bytes objects, which directly relates to the confusion over byte string comparisons. The other functions like `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls` are part of the broader comparison mechanisms, but they do not directly deal with the byte string comparison issue at hand.
