Additionally, functions like `assertrepr_compare`, `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls` in 'util.py' are responsible for generating detailed comparisons and differences, which are crucial for understanding the assertion errors, particularly with byte strings.
