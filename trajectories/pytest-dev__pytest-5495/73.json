The sample test cases provided show how the assertion error messages are confusing when comparing empty byte strings to non-empty ones. The ASCII ordinal of '4' is mentioned as 52, which is part of the confusing message. To address this, we need to look into the parts of the code responsible for assertion rewriting and especially how byte strings are handled in these comparisons.\n\n1. We first look into the `rewrite_asserts` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. This function is responsible for rewriting the assertions in the test files.\n\n2. The `assertrepr_compare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` is crucial as it constructs the detailed assertion explanation, which is where the confusing message likely originates.\n\n3. Additionally, the `_diff_text` function (also in `util.py`) handles the diffing of text, which could be crucial for handling byte strings given the examples provided in the issue. The function `escape_for_readable_diff` could be a reason for the confusing output, especially when dealing with byte strings.\n\n4. Other helper functions like `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, etc., all in `util.py`, also contribute to the representation of differences and could be involved in how the byte string comparisons are displayed.\n\nOverall, the key areas to focus on are the assertion rewriting process and how byte strings are specifically handled in these processes. The provided search results cover the relevant functions and methods that are likely involved in the confusing assertion rewriting messages for byte strings.",
