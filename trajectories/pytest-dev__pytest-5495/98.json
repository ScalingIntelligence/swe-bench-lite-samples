The user provides examples of test cases using byte strings, showcasing diff outputs that include ASCII ordinal values. The confusion lies in the interpretation of these ordinal values as part of the error message. The search results primarily focus on the `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` files, which contain methods and classes relevant to assertion rewriting and utility functions, respectively. These files are highly relevant to the issue since they define how assertions are rewritten and how comparison results are explained. Within `rewrite.py`, we find the `AssertionRewriter` class and its method `visit_Compare`, which is responsible for handling comparison operations in the AST. This method could potentially be where the confusion arises in case of byte string comparisons. In `util.py`, functions such as `assertrepr_compare` and `_diff_text` are central to producing comparison explanations, which need to be clear and accurate, especially for byte strings. These functions are likely spots for improving the clarity of the assertion error messages regarding byte strings. Identifying these specific spans of code is crucial as they directly address the functionality that needs to be improved to resolve the issue.",

The search results from `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` contain the relevant functions `assertrepr_compare` and `_diff_text` which handle the comparison and provide the difference for text and byte strings. These functions are crucial for the assertion error messages related to byte strings. Both the `assertrepr_compare` and `_diff_text` spans have been previously identified in the file context, and they remain the most relevant functions for handling the comparison and displaying the differences between byte strings. The logic in these functions directly addresses the issue of confusing assertion messages for byte strings. The `_diff_text` function specifically includes logic to escape binary text for a readable diff, which is likely where improvements could be made to better address the confusion described in the issue. The `_diff_text` function is situated within the broader comparison handler `assertrepr_compare`, detailing specifically how text comparisons should be processed, including those involving byte strings. Thus, the logic for managing and representing byte string differences is central to addressing the issue. However, the confusion arises from the way ASCII ordinal numbers are presented (like '52' for '4'), which is directly managed within the `_diff_text` function's formatting of byte string differences. The search results reinforce the centrality of this function in resolving the issue.",
