The functions identified directly relate to this use case.\n\n3.3 Evaluate relevance of each code span based on alignment with reported issue\nBoth assertrepr_compare and _diff_text are directly related to the assertion handling and byte string comparison mentioned in the issue.\n\n3.4 If new functions or classes are suggested by the issue, identify their relevance.\nNo new functions or classes are suggested by the reported issue itself.\n\n3.7 Identify and extract relevant code spans\nThe functions assertrepr_compare and _diff_text are extracted based on their direct involvement in handling byte strings during assertion comparisons.\n\n3.6 Verify any references to other parts of the codebase\nOther parts of the codebase that handle byte strings might be relevant but are not directly referenced or required to address the immediate issue.\n\n3.5 Review entire sections of code for completeness\nThe identified functions are part of a larger module handling various types of assertions.

These functions are responsible for generating the comparison explanations for assertions, including how they handle text and bytes. \n\nThe `_diff_text` function specifically deals with byte strings and includes logic to escape binary text for a readable diff. This is highly relevant to the issue as it directly addresses the comparison and representation of byte strings.\n\nAdditionally, the `_compare_eq_sequence` function might also be relevant as it seems to handle sequence comparisons, which could include byte strings. However, the main focus should be on `_diff_text` since it deals directly with binary text representation, which is the core concern of the reported issue.",
