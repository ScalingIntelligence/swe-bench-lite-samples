It uses various helper functions like '_diff_text' for text comparisons, which could be relevant for byte string comparisons. The '_diff_text' function specifically handles text types, including bytes, and uses 'repr' for escaping binary text, which could be part of the confusion. Additionally, the helper functions for verbose and iterable comparisons, like '_compare_eq_verbose' and '_compare_eq_iterable', provide more detailed output when verbose mode is enabled, which might be relevant for understanding detailed byte string comparisons.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue reported, the focus should be on the sections of code that handle detailed comparison and representation of equality assertions, especially for text types (including bytes). The code spans related to generating detailed explanations or diffs for text comparisons are most relevant.
