Additionally, the `rewrite_asserts` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` might also be pertinent as it involves the rewriting of assertion statements.

It processes strings and byte objects, potentially influencing how the error messages are displayed.\n\n2. **AssertionRewriter**: This class is responsible for rewriting assertions. Its methods might be manipulating how byte string comparisons are handled or displayed.\n\n3. **assertrepr_compare**: This function provides rich representations for comparison assertions. It uses `saferepr` for representing the objects in the output, which is crucial for how the byte strings are shown in the error message.\n\n4. **_diff_text**: This function computes the difference between two texts, which is directly related to the comparison of byte strings. It processes the strings to make the difference more readable, and it's likely where the ASCII ordinal conversion happens.\n\n5. **_compare_eq_sequence**: This function specifically compares sequences. Since byte strings are essentially sequences of bytes, this function is likely to be involved in the comparison logic for byte strings, including the part where it reports the first extra item using its ASCII ordinal.\n\nBy focusing on these parts of the code, we can identify the necessary changes or improvements to make the assertion rewriting messages less confusing when dealing with byte strings.",
