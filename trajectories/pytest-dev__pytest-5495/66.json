The example provided in the issue shows the confusion caused by the assertion error messages, specifically regarding the difference in byte strings. The key function involved in the generation of these messages is `assertrepr_compare` which is responsible for generating detailed comparison explanation for failed assertions. The `_compare_eq_sequence` function within this context is particularly relevant as it handles the comparison of sequences, which includes byte strings. This function is responsible for generating the detailed output when the lengths of the sequences differ, which matches the scenario described in the issue. The other function `rewrite_asserts` from `rewrite.py` is also relevant but less directly related to the issue as it handles the rewriting of assert statements for better error reporting, but not the actual comparison logic. Therefore, the focus should be on `assertrepr_compare` and `_compare_eq_sequence` for addressing the issue.",
