The problem is particularly evident in the pytest assertion message formatting, which needs to be clearer when dealing with comparisons involving byte strings. The key functions and modules to investigate are those involved in assertion rewriting and comparison visualization. This includes modules like `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, and potentially `src/_pytest/compat.py` for any ASCII handling. The target functions are likely within `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, or broader assertion comparison functions in `util.py`. Further, understanding how custom assertion messages are handled, as seen in `pytest_assertrepr_compare`, can provide clues.",
