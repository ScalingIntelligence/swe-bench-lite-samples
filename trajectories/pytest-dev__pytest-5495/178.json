The provided examples show that the assertion error messages, while technically correct, are not intuitive, especially when the error messages mention ASCII ordinal values like 52 and 49. To address this, it would be beneficial to look into the assertion rewriting and comparison logic in the _pytest module. Specifically, the focus should be on functions dealing with comparison and assertion rewriting for byte strings. The `assertrepr_compare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` and the `rewrite_asserts` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` are potential starting points.",

The reported issue specifically mentions the confusing assertion error messages for byte string comparisons, which include ASCII ordinals like '52' for '4'. This suggests that the relevant code spans should include those that handle byte string comparisons and generate the assertion messages. In the provided search results, several key functions are identified that are likely to be involved in this process:\n\n1. `rewrite_asserts` from `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` - This function appears to be involved in rewriting assertions, which is a key part of the assertion handling process.\n2. `assertrepr_compare` from `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` - This function is responsible for generating detailed comparison explanations for assertions, which is directly related to the assertion messages in question.\n3. `_diff_text` from `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` - This function is used to generate text diffs, which are likely to be used in generating the detailed assertion messages for text (and potentially byte string) comparisons.\n4. `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls` from `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` - These functions are related to detailed comparison handling for different types, including text and sequences, and could be involved in handling byte string comparisons.\n5. `_notin_text` from `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` - While this function is related to handling cases where text is not in another text, it may still be relevant to understanding the overall handling of text (including byte strings) in assertion messages.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue and the functions identified in the search results, it is reasonable to conclude that the provided code spans are relevant to addressing the issue of confusing assertion messages with byte strings. These spans cover the main functions involved in assertion rewriting and handling, including those that generate detailed comparison explanations and handle different types of comparisons.",
