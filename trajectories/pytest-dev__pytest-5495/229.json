The user provides examples where the assertion failure message includes ASCII ordinal values which makes the message unclear. This issue is related to the pytest assertion rewriting functionality, specifically how the differences between byte strings are represented in the assertion failure messages. The code spans identified are part of the pytest assertion rewriting utility, which includes functions that handle the comparison and representation of differing objects, including byte strings. The '_diff_text' function is particularly relevant as it handles the comparison of text, which includes byte strings. This function is responsible for calculating and formatting the difference between two texts, which could be used to provide more readable and informative messages when assertions involving byte strings fail. The 'assertrepr_compare' function, which orchestrates the various comparison functions, is also relevant as it directs the flow of comparison based on the type of objects being compared. By examining these functions, we can assess their impact on the clarity and informativeness of byte string comparison failure messages within pytest. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are '_diff_text', '_compare_eq_verbose', '_compare_eq_iterable', '_compare_eq_sequence', '_compare_eq_set', '_compare_eq_dict', '_compare_eq_cls', and '_notin_text'. These functions collectively contribute to the assertion rewriting functionality, including how byte string comparisons are handled and reported.",
