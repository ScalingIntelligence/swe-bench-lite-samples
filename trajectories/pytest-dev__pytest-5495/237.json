It specifically points out that the ASCII ordinal of characters is shown in the error message, which can be confusing. The search results reveal several functions and methods in the pytest assertion rewriting module that handle comparisons between different types of objects, including byte strings. The 'assertrepr_compare' function is a central piece, determining how to compare left and right operands based on their types. It segregates comparisons into text, sequence, set, dict, and class based on their types. For byte strings, the '_diff_text' function is used to generate a diff with details about the differences. This function handles escaping of binary text for readable diffs and skips identical leading and trailing characters unless verbose output is requested. The '_compare_eq_sequence' function may also be relevant as it provides detailed output for sequences, including byte strings. Further, the '_compare_eq_verbose' and '_compare_eq_iterable' functions assist in providing verbose output for a more detailed comparison. These functions collectively offer context and detailed comparison outputs which are crucial for understanding the differences when byte strings do not match, thereby addressing the reported issue. Thus, these functions and their implementations are highly relevant to the issue of confusing assertion rewriting messages with byte strings.",
