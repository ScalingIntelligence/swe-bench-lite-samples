The provided search results contain several relevant code spans within the `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` file, particularly in the `assertrepr_compare` function and its helper functions such as `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, and `_compare_eq_iterable`. These spans handle the comparison and representation of differences between byte strings, which directly address the confusion mentioned in the issue. The analysis of these code spans indicates that they are likely involved in generating the assertion messages seen in the issue, suggesting that they are the relevant parts of the codebase that need to be reviewed or modified to resolve the issue. Additionally, the `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` could potentially be related to the rewriting of assertions involving byte strings, but direct relevance is less clear from the provided code spans.",
