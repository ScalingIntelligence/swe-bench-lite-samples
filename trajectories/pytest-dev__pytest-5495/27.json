The problem seems to be in how the assertion comparison between byte strings is displayed, particularly with the ASCII ordinal values appearing in the error messages. The relevant files that might contain the logic for handling such comparisons are 'src/_pytest/assertion/util.py' and 'src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py', as these deal with assertion rewriting and comparison utilities. The focus should be on functions or methods that handle comparison of byte strings, such as '_compare_eq_sequence' in 'util.py' or 'visit_Compare' in 'rewrite.py'.",
