Specifically, the error messages for byte string comparisons are unclear, with ASCII ordinals being presented without context. The search results cover files related to the pytest assertion rewriting and utility functions, which are directly relevant to the issue. The relevant code spans include the `assertrepr_compare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`, which handles comparison explanations for assertions, and the `_diff_text` function, which specifically deals with text differences. These functions are key for generating the comparison output seen in the issue report. The analysis of these functions shows that they already handle byte strings but may need adjustments to improve message clarity.
