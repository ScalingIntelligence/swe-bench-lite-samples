The main focus seems to be on the `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` files, which contain functions related to assertion rewriting and comparison. In particular, `rewrite_asserts` and `assertrepr_compare` functions are directly involved in the process of assertion rewriting and comparison, making them highly relevant. Additionally, the `_diff_text` function is responsible for handling differences in text comparisons, which could be important for understanding the confusion with byte strings. The other functions like `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls` are also relevant as they handle specific types of comparisons that could be involved in the assertion rewriting process. The `doc/en/example/assertion/failure_demo.py` file contains test cases that demonstrate the use of assertions, which could be useful for understanding the context of the reported issue. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans are: `rewrite_asserts`, `assertrepr_compare`, `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, `_compare_eq_cls`, and the test cases in `failure_demo.py`.",
