The relevant search results detail the functions that handle comparison operations and text diffing. The 'rewrite_asserts' function manages the rewriting of assertions, while 'assertrepr_compare' generates detailed explanations for assertion failures, including comparisons between byte strings. The '_diff_text' function specifically handles the diffing of text, which is pertinent to the example given in the issue. This function has handling for byte strings and provides readable diffs which could be the source of confusion noted.
