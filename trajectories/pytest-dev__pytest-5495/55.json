The issue is specific to how pytest handles the comparison of byte strings during assertion rewriting, leading to confusing error messages. To address this, we need to focus on the relevant parts of the pytest codebase that handle assertion rewriting and comparison of objects. The search results provide several key functions and classes that are directly involved in this process: `rewrite_asserts`, `AssertionRewriter`, `assertrepr_compare`, and helper functions like `_diff_text`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, etc. These functions and classes are responsible for rewriting assertions and generating comparison explanations, which are crucial for this issue.
