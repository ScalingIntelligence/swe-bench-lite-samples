Specifically, the confusion arises from the ASCII ordinal values appearing in the assertion error messages. Given the nature of the issue, it's crucial to locate the code responsible for generating these assertion error messages, particularly where byte strings are compared and differences are explained. The relevant files already identified might not directly address the byte string comparison issue but provide context on how assertions are processed and messages are generated. Focusing on files like src/_pytest/assertion/util.py, specifically the functions handling detailed comparison outputs ('_compare_eq_iterable', '_compare_eq_sequence', etc.), is a good starting point. Additionally, examining the src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py file to understand how asserts are rewritten and formatted could provide further insights.",

The provided search results include several code spans in two files ('rewrite.py' and 'util.py'), which are relevant to assertion rewriting and the handling of byte string comparisons. \n\nThe 'AssertionRewriter' class in 'rewrite.py' seems to be the central class for assertion rewriting, initiating the process and manipulating Python AST representations of the code. \n\nIn 'util.py', the 'assertrepr_compare' function handles the actual comparison of values during assertions, deciding how to display differences depending on the type of the values (like text, sequences, sets, dicts, or other classes). This function delegates to various helper functions like '_diff_text', which is specifically tasked with producing diffs between strings or byte strings. This function is likely the one confused by byte string comparisons as mentioned in the issue. \n\nOther functions like '_compare_eq_sequence' dedicate to longer comparisons and display of extra items in sequences, which might also relate to byte strings if they are treated as sequences of characters. \n\nOverall, these functions and the class together build the toolkit needed for most assertion rewriting operations in pytest, directly relevant to the user's reported issue with byte strings. This suggests deeper examination of '_diff_text' specifically for potential implementation adjustments to address the user's confusion.",
