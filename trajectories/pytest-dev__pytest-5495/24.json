The example provided shows an assertion error where the byte strings are compared, and the error message refers to the ASCII ordinal of the differing characters. The search results include several functions from the `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` file that could be relevant to this issue. Specifically, `assertrepr_compare`, `_diff_text`, and `_compare_eq_iterable` are related to comparison and diff generation which are core to the assertion rewriting functionality. These functions handle the comparison of sequences, text, and provide diff explanations. The function `assertrepr_compare` is particularly important as it decides how to compare and represent the difference between left and right values for equality checks. It further delegates to `_diff_text` when both values are text, which is relevant to byte strings as they can be considered text in this context. The other functions like `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, `_compare_eq_dict`, and `_compare_eq_cls` support different types of comparisons and might indirectly contribute to the handling of byte strings by providing comprehensive comparison mechanisms for different data types. On the other hand, the functions in `src/_pytest/compat.py` do not seem directly relevant to the issue at hand as they appear to be more about general compatibility and not specific to assertion rewriting or byte string handling.",
