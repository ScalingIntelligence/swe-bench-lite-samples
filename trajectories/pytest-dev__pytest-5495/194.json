This function checks the type of the left and right operands and delegates to different helper functions based on the type. For byte strings (which are instances of `bytes`), it uses the `_diff_text` function.\n\nThe `_diff_text` function is responsible for generating the diff for text or byte strings. It handles escaping of binary text for a more readable diff. Since the issue involves byte strings specifically, this function is highly relevant.\n\nOther helper functions listed, such as `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_iterable`, and `_compare_eq_sequence`, are not directly related to byte strings or the specific issue but are part of the broader assertion rewriting machinery.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the most relevant span is the `_diff_text` function, which directly handles the comparison and diffing of byte strings.",
