The provided examples and stack traces indicate that the problem lies within the comparison logic for byte strings in pytest's assertion handling. The relevant files seem to be the ones handling assertions and their rewriting. Specifically, the files in the 'src/_pytest/assertion/' directory are highly relevant, as they contain functions and methods lik `assertrepr_compare`, `_compare_eq_verbose`, and `_compare_eq_iterable` which are directly involved in how assertions are processed and displayed. Additionally, the `rewrite_asserts` function in '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py' is where the actual assertion rewriting happens, so it may also contain a part of the problem. To narrow down the exact location of the issue, we should focus on the comparison logic for byte strings within these files.",

The issue involves confusion over the ASCII ordinal representation in diff outputs for byte strings, particularly when comparing empty byte strings to those containing simple byte representations like '42' or '1'. The primary relevant code spans are those dealing directly with the comparison of byte strings within the assertrepr_compare function and its supporting functions. From the provided search results, I identified the `assertrepr_compare` function and its related helper functions, particularly `_diff_text`, which handles the diffing of text and byte strings. This function uses the difflib module and includes logic to adjust and display detailed differences between the byte strings being compared. Given the nature of the issue, these code spans seem highly relevant for a first pass analysis and potential modification to clarify the assertion error messages for byte strings. Further steps might involve adjusting the escape logic for byte strings or modifying the detailed diff display to provide more context, possibly enhancing the `_diff_text` function to include ASCII representation within the diff output for enhanced clarity, ensuring that the reported issue is addressed directly.",
