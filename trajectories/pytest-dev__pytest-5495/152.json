Specifically, when an assertion like `assert b'' == b'42'` fails, the error message mentions 'Right contains more items, first extra item: 52', which corresponds to the ASCII ordinal of '4'. This makes it unclear to the user what exactly is being compared. The provided search results contain relevant sections of code that might be involved in generating these messages:\n\n1. `assertrepr_compare` in `util.py` appears to be a function that possibly formats the comparison when assertions fail. It formats the left and right sides of the comparison and constructs a summary message.\n\n2. `_compare_eq_verbose` in `util.py` further elaborates on the comparison by generating a verbose explanation, which includes the difference between the left and right sides of the comparison prefixed with '-' and '+'.\n\n3. `AssertionRewriter.visit_Compare` in `rewrite.py` involves the assertion rewriting mechanism, which rewrites the comparisons in the test code to provide more informative failure messages. This function visits comparison nodes in the AST to rewrite them.\n\nThese sections of code are likely relevant because they directly involve the assertion messages and the rewriting process necessary for the reported issue. The function `pytest_assertrepr_compare` in `hookspec.py` is also relevant as it is a hook specification for custom comparison explanations that plugins can provide, indicating that this module is part of the broader mechanism for assertion rewrite customization.\n\nBy examining these code spans, we can gather essential parts of the codebase that contribute to the confusing assertion messages for byte string comparisons.",
