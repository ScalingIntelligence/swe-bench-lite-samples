The user pointed out that the ASCII ordinal representation of bytes in the assertion error messages (like '52' for '4') is confusing. The analysis of the existing code spans shows that the function `_diff_text` is directly handling the comparison of byte strings and the representation of differences. This function includes a mechanism for escaping binary text to make the diff more readable, and it manipulates and formats the string representations of the byte strings involved in the comparison. This code span directly addresses the user's confusion as it attempts to clarify the diff output for byte strings. Other spans in the `assertrepr_compare` function handle the overall assertion representation and how different types of objects are compared, which is also relevant context for understanding how byte string comparisons fit into the larger framework. The `saferepr` function in another file (src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py) is also important as it determines the string representation of objects in the assertion messages, potentially influencing how byte strings are displayed.",
