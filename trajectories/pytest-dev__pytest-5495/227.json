The example provided shows that when asserting equality between byte strings of different lengths, the error message contains ASCII ordinals which can be confusing for users. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant sections of the codebase that handle the assertion rewriting and comparison of byte strings specifically. The search results contain several relevant functions in the 'src/_pytest/assertion/util.py' file. These functions include 'assertrepr_compare', which is the main function for generating assertion explanations, and '_diff_text', which specifically deals with comparing text. Given the nature of the issue, the '_diff_text' function is particularly relevant as it handles the comparison of byte strings and generates the diff output. Additionally, the '_compare_eq_verbose', '_compare_eq_iterable', '_compare_eq_sequence', '_compare_eq_set', '_compare_eq_dict', and '_compare_eq_cls' functions are also relevant as they handle different types of comparisons and might be involved in the overall assertion rewriting process.
