The provided example shows a misleading assertion error message where the ASCII ordinal of a character is displayed instead of a straightforward comparison. To address this, it's necessary to delve into the pytest assertion rewriting and comparison logic. The related files and functions listed in the context provide a good starting point. Specifically, the `assertrepr_compare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` is a key point to investigate, as it handles how assertions are explained in the failure messages. Additionally, `_compare_eq_sequence` might also be relevant, as it deals with equality comparison of sequences, which byte strings are an instance of. The goal is to identify how byte strings are being compared and potentially suggest improvements to the error message generation process.",

The user provided examples where the assertion error message is not clear when comparing byte strings, specifically mentioning ASCII ordinals like 52 for '4'. To address this, we need to find code that deals with the comparison of byte strings in the assertion rewriting process. The search results show several relevant functions in 'src/_pytest/assertion/util.py':\n1. 'assertrepr_compare' function handles various types of comparisons, including equality checks for text and sequences. It calls '_diff_text' and other comparison functions based on the type of the objects.\n2. '_diff_text' function is specifically for diffing text, including byte strings. It has logic to handle byte strings by escaping them for a readable diff.\n3. Other functions like '_compare_eq_verbose', '_compare_eq_iterable', '_compare_eq_sequence', '_compare_eq_set', '_compare_eq_dict', and '_compare_eq_cls' handle different types of comparisons, which might also be relevant if the issue extends beyond byte strings to other types.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the search results, the relevant code spans are in the 'assertrepr_compare' and '_diff_text' functions, which directly handle the comparison and diffing of byte strings. These functions should be inspected closely to see if they can be improved to provide clearer error messages for byte string comparisons, as described in the issue.",
