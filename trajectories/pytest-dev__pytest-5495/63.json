Relevant files appear to be those handling assertion rewriting, comparison, and the representation of differences in byte strings. Identifying where and how these comparisons are made, especially for byte strings, is crucial for understanding the problem. Due to the nature of the issue, it's likely connected to `assertrepr_compare` and comparison functions in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` or similar parts of the codebase dealing with assertion logic.

The provided search results contain several functions that handle the comparison and diffing of various types, including byte strings. The key function of interest is `assertrepr_compare`, which determines how the comparison is handled based on the type of data. For byte strings, the relevant function is `_diff_text`, which is called when the types are text (str) or bytes. This function is responsible for generating the diff and handling escape sequences for readability. By examining these functions, we can see how byte strings are treated and potentially identify any areas of confusion or improvement related to the generated diff messages. Additionally, other functions like `_compare_eq_verbose` and `_compare_eq_iterable` are related to handling more general comparison scenarios, which could also influence how byte string comparisons are presented. Given the issue's focus on byte strings and the clear connection to the identified functions, it is reasonable to conclude that these code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",
