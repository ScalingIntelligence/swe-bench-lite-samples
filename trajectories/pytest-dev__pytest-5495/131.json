The provided examples indicate that the assertion error messages are enhanced in a way that might be misinterpreted by users. Specifically, it seems the first extra item in the byte string comparison is represented by its ASCII ordinal, which could be confusing. All the provided files are part of the pytest framework and deal with differing aspects of assertion rewriting, comparison, and representation. Given the complexity of this issue, understanding and potentially modifying the behavior of the assertion rewriting and comparison logic, located in the `src/_pytest/assertion/` directory and its submodules, would be necessary. One such submodule, `rewrite.py`, showcases the mechanism for rewriting asserts, while the `util.py` provides comparison and error representation functionalities. Further investigation should focus on functions within these files and the customization of error messages to handle byte strings in a more user-friendly manner.",

The search results provide several functions that handle different types of comparisons, including byte strings. The '_diff_text' function is particularly relevant as it deals with the comparison of text, which would include byte strings. This function handles the creation of a diff for text and includes logic to escape binary text for readability. Additionally, the 'assertrepr_compare' function, which orchestrates the comparison logic, includes a check for byte strings and delegates to '_diff_text' when appropriate. These functions are crucial for addressing the issue as they directly involve the comparison and presentation of differences in byte strings.",
