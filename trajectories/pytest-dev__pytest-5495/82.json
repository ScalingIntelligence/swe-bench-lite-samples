Specifically, the assertion error messages are not clear when comparing byte strings, leading to confusion about the differences between the byte strings.\n\nGiven the search results, several functions and utility methods in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` seem relevant to this issue. These functions handle the comparison and representation of differences for various types, including byte strings and sequences. The `assertrepr_compare` function is particularly relevant as it is responsible for generating the explanation of comparison outcomes, which would include byte strings. Additionally, the `_diff_text` function appears to handle the comparison of text-like objects, which could include byte strings, and might need adjustments to handle byte strings more effectively.\n\nRelated functions such as `_compare_eq_verbose`, `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, `_compare_eq_set`, and `_compare_eq_dict` could also be reviewed if they influence how byte strings are compared and represented in the assertion errors. Moreover, the `_compare_eq_cls` function might be relevant if byte strings are part of a class or data structure being compared.\n\nOverall, the identified functions in the `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` file are sufficient to address the issue at hand as they cover the various aspects of comparison handling, including the representation of byte strings. Further modification of these functions may be required to improve the clarity of the assertion messages for byte strings.",
