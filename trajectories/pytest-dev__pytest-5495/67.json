The provided examples show that the assertion error messages are not intuitive when dealing with byte strings. The focus should be on identifying the code responsible for generating these messages. Given the context of the error messages, the relevant files seem to be those related to assertion rewriting and comparison handling, particularly `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` and `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. These files contain functions responsible for assertion comparison and rewriting, which might need adjustments to handle byte string comparisons better.",

The given examples highlight the problematic assertion comparisons which display ASCII ordinal values (like 52 for '4' and 49 for '1') making the output confusing. The search results contain several key functions and methods that are directly related to assertion rewriting and comparison handling. Specifically, the functions `assertrepr_compare`, `_diff_text`, and `_compare_eq_sequence` in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` are central to the comparison logic and could potentially be modified to improve the output for byte strings. Additionally, the `rewrite_asserts` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` is responsible for the actual rewriting of assertions, and understanding its interaction with the comparison functions is crucial. Therefore, these functions are identified as relevant based on their direct involvement in handling the assertion rewriting and comparison logic, which should be examined and possibly modified to address the issue. It's important to note that the current implementation in `_diff_text` seems to handle byte strings but could be made more user-friendly by better explaining the ASCII representation in the diff output.",
