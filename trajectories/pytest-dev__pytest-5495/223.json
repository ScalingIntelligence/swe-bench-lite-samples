Two key functions, '_rewrite_test' and 'rewrite_asserts', are found processing the test functions and rewriting the asserts respectively. In 'src/_pytest/assertion/util.py', the 'assertrepr_compare' function is relevant as it provides detailed comparison explanations including how different types, such as byte strings, are handled. Furthermore, specific functions like '_diff_text', '_compare_eq_sequence', and '_compare_eq_iterable' handle the detailed diffing of sequences, which is crucial for understanding the differences in byte strings. These functions are instrumental in determining how differences between byte strings are communicated and thus directly address the issue at hand.",

Additionally, the `_diff_text` function within `util.py` specifically addresses the comparison of text objects, including byte strings, and provides a detailed diff. The `_compare_eq_iterable`, `_compare_eq_sequence`, and other related functions also contribute to the comparison logic. Furthermore, the `pytest_assertrepr_compare` hook in `__init__.py` is set to `util.assertrepr_compare`, indicating that this is the entry point for customizing assertion representations.
