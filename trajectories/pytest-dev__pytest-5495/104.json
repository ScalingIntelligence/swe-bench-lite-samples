The section 'assertrepr_compare' is particularly relevant as it handles the comparison logic for '==' operations and differentiates between text and other types of data. Inside 'assertrepr_compare', the '_diff_text' function is called when both left and right are text, but it also checks for byte strings and processes them differently. This function is directly related to the issue of ASCII ordinal interpretation in byte string comparisons.
