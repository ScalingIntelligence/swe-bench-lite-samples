The provided search results include multiple files, but the most relevant one is `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, which contains classes and functions related to assertion rewriting. The key spans to look at are related to the `AssertionRewritingHook` class, which is responsible for rewriting assertions, and the `Rewrite_asserts` function, which handles the rewriting of assert statements. These spans likely contain the code directly involved in the rewriting process, thus relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the `_saferepr` function also appears relevant as it relates to the representation of objects, possibly in error messages. Looking at these spans should provide enough context to address the confusing assertion messages related to byte strings.",
