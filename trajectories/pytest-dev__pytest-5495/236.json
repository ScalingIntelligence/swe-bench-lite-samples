The examples provided indicate that the assertion error message is not clear, especially when dealing with byte strings. The focus is on understanding and potentially improving how pytest handles and displays differences in byte string comparisons within assertion errors. From the search results, the most relevant code spans are those that deal with the comparison of text (including byte strings) and the generation of detailed assertion explanations. The function `assertrepr_compare` is central as it orchestrates the comparison and generation of detailed explanations for different types of comparisons. Specifically, `_diff_text` is directly involved in handling text and byte string differences, making it highly relevant to the issue at hand. Furthermore, `_compare_eq_sequence` and `_compare_eq_iterable` are also relevant as they handle sequence comparisons, which include byte strings. These functions construct the detailed diff explanations that are part of the assertion error messages. Therefore, these functions need to be carefully examined to understand how they handle byte strings and potentially suggest improvements to the clarity of the error messages.",
