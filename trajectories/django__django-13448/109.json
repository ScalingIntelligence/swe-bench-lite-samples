The error is occurring during the execution of 'create_test_db' method in Django where it tries to serialize the database to a string. Since the table 'django_admin_log' does not exist, it seems that the database is not getting migrated when MIGRATE is set to False. The 'create_test_db' method in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' is identified as relevant because it deals with the creation of test databases and the migration process based on the settings. The method checks if MIGRATE is True to decide whether to run migrations before serialization. Given the traceback, the exception occurs during the serialization step which suggests that the database is expected to have certain tables which it does not have because migrations were skipped. This suggests that the code related to the creation of test databases and the setting of 'MIGRATE' could be critical to resolve the issue.",
