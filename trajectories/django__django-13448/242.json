The traceback indicates issues related to missing tables and invalid cursor names in the database backend, which suggests that certain database operations that are usually handled by migrations are failing because migrations are being skipped. This could be due to legacy code or settings that assume certain database states that are not present without running migrations. To debug this, focus on the areas where database setup and test database creation occur, and look for any code that might rely on migrated tables directly.",

The 'BaseDatabaseCreation' class in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' which deals with the creation of test databases and the setting regarding the migration during testing. Specifically, 'BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db' is of interest as it contains logic to call migrations based on the 'TEST' settings. The failure could stem from how 'MIGRATE': False is handled in this method.\n2. The 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' which is responsible for executing migrations. Understanding how this class behaves when migrations are not to be executed ('MIGRATE': False) can help troubleshoot why the test setup might be failing.\n3. The specific database backends (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle) in their respective 'creation.py' files each handle test database creation differently, particularly in the '_create_test_db' and '_clone_test_db' methods. These methods need inspection to ensure that disabling migrations ('MIGRATE': False) doesn't disrupt database creation for tests.\n\nThese code spans are directly related to the reported issue, especially around how test databases are created and managed under the 'MIGRATE': False setting. Further investigation will be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure, considering the wide range of database backends and their various implementations of test database management.",

Specifically, the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class and its subclasses in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` and the corresponding backend-specific creation files define the behavior for creating test databases, which is critical when the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting is used. The `migrate` command in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` also plays a role in setting up the database schema, which would be skipped if 'MIGRATE': False is set. Given the traceback and the nature of the issue (failure when skipping migrations), the relevant code for handling this configuration is present in the provided file context. Additional context might be needed to fully debug why the specific table (`django_admin_log`) is not found, but the code responsible for managing the test database and migrations is here.",
