  "initial_message": "Test runner setup_databases crashes with \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False}.\nDescription\n\t\nI'm trying to upgrade a project from Django 3.0 to Django 3.1 and wanted to try out the new \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} database setting.\nSadly I'm running into an issue immediately when running ./manage.py test.\nRemoving the \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} line allows the tests to run. So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback. I'll try to debug this some more.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 84, in _execute\n\treturn self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\npsycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable: relation \"django_admin_log\" does not exist\nLINE 1: ...n_flag\", \"django_admin_log\".\"change_message\" FROM \"django_ad...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ^\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", line 1156, in execute_sql\n\tcursor.execute(sql, params)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 66, in execute\n\treturn self._execute_with_wrappers(sql, params, many=False, executor=self._execute)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 75, in _execute_with_wrappers\n\treturn executor(sql, params, many, context)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 84, in _execute\n\treturn self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/utils.py\", line 90, in __exit__\n\traise dj_exc_value.with_traceback(traceback) from exc_value\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 84, in _execute\n\treturn self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\ndjango.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation \"django_admin_log\" does not exist\nLINE 1: ...n_flag\", \"django_admin_log\".\"change_message\" FROM \"django_ad...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ^\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"./manage.py\", line 15, in <module>\n\tmain()\n File \"./manage.py\", line 11, in main\n\texecute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 401, in execute_from_command_line\n\tutility.execute()\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 395, in execute\n\tself.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/test.py\", line 23, in run_from_argv\n\tsuper().run_from_argv(argv)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 330, in run_from_argv\n\tself.execute(*args, **cmd_options)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 371, in execute\n\toutput = self.handle(*args, **options)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/test.py\", line 53, in handle\n\tfailures = test_runner.run_tests(test_labels)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/test/runner.py\", line 695, in run_tests\n\told_config = self.setup_databases(aliases=databases)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/test/runner.py\", line 616, in setup_databases\n\tself.parallel, **kwargs\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/test/utils.py\", line 174, in setup_databases\n\tserialize=connection.settings_dict['TEST'].get('SERIALIZE', True),\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", line 78, in create_test_db\n\tself.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", line 121, in serialize_db_to_string\n\tserializers.serialize(\"json\", get_objects(), indent=None, stream=out)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/serializers/__init__.py\", line 128, in serialize\n\ts.serialize(queryset, **options)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/serializers/base.py\", line 90, in serialize\n\tfor count, obj in enumerate(queryset, start=1):\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", line 118, in get_objects\n\tyield from queryset.iterator()\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 360, in _iterator\n\tyield from self._iterable_class(self, chunked_fetch=use_chunked_fetch, chunk_size=chunk_size)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 53, in __iter__\n\tresults = compiler.execute_sql(chunked_fetch=self.chunked_fetch, chunk_size=self.chunk_size)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", line 1159, in execute_sql\n\tcursor.close()\npsycopg2.errors.InvalidCursorName: cursor \"_django_curs_139860821038912_sync_1\" does not exist\n"
