The traceback indicates a problem when attempting to run tests after setting this configuration, specifically related to missing tables like 'django_admin_log' which should be created through migrations. The provided search results include relevant code spans from Django's database backend creation scripts, such as `_create_test_db` methods in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py`, `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`, and `django/db/backends/oracle/creation.py`. These methods handle the creation and management of test databases, including operations like dropping and recreating databases, which aligns with the errors mentioned in the traceback about missing tables and cursor issues.

The traceback indicates a `ProgrammingError` related to an undefined table 'django_admin_log'. This suggests that the test database setup might not be correctly handling the case where migrations are skipped. Several key files and functions were identified as potentially relevant to this issue: 1. `BaseDatabaseCreation`, particularly `_create_test_db`, which manages the creation of test databases. 2. `ConnectionHandler`, which includes the `prepare_test_settings` method, responsible for setting up test settings including the 'MIGRATE' option. 3. `MigrationExecutor`, which handles the execution of migrations, might provide insight into how migrations are skipped or handled during tests. Additional search results confirmed these suspicions by revealing critical sections such as the default settings for 'TEST_RUNNER' and 'MIGRATION_MODULES' in `global_settings.py`, and the `prepare_test_settings` method within `ConnectionHandler`. These sections are essential as they define how test settings are prepared and how migrations are managed during the test phase. The identified spans are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior when 'MIGRATE' is set to False.",

The traceback indicates that the error occurs due to a missing table 'django_admin_log' during the test setup. This suggests that there might be a dependency on migrations even when trying to skip them, possibly due to some legacy code or settings.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, it is clear that the key files and code spans to focus on are those related to the database settings, especially 'TEST' settings and how they are handled in the 'ConnectionHandler.prepare_test_settings' method. Also, the 'MigrationLoader' and 'MigrationExecutor' classes are crucial as they handle the loading and execution of migrations.\n\nThe 'MigrationLoader' class's 'migrations_module' method is particularly relevant as it determines the module where migrations are stored. The 'MigrationExecutor' class's '_create_project_state' method is important because it creates the state of the project, including the applied migrations. However, the most direct relevance to the issue seems to be in 'django/db/utils.py' where the 'prepare_test_settings' method specifically sets up the test database settings, including the 'MIGRATION' setting which could be causing the crash when set to False. It's likely that further debugging or a tweak around these settings could resolve the issue.",

The traceback indicates a failure due to an undefined table 'django_admin_log'. This suggests that the test database is not being properly set up, possibly due to the 'MIGRATE': False setting disabling migrations during testing.\n\nGiven the file context and search results, the focus should be on the database creation and test settings preparation. The relevant code spans include:\n1. `BaseDatabaseCreation._create_test_db` and `BaseDatabaseCreation._get_test_db_name` in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` - This class and method are critical for creating and naming the test database, which is likely involved in the crash.\n2. `ConnectionHandler.prepare_test_settings` in `django/db/utils.py` - This method sets up the test settings, including the 'MIGRATE' option, which directly relates to the issue.\n3. `DatabaseCreation._get_test_db_name` in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py` - This method determines the name of the test database in the SQLite backend, which can be relevant for understanding the database configuration.\n\nThese code spans provide a good starting point for investigating why the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting causes the test runner to crash. Further analysis may involve checking the database schema loading process in the absence of migrations and ensuring that necessary tables are created or available in this context.\n\nGiven the analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly involve the database creation and the handling of the 'MIGRATE' test setting.",
