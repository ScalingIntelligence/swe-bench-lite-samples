This indicates that some code is trying to access a table that hasn't been created because migrations are being skipped. The traceback suggests that the error occurs during the setup of the test database when attempting to serialize the database contents. This points to the 'create_test_db' method in 'BaseDatabaseCreation' as a potential source of the issue. Additionally, the 'migrate' command and migration executor are likely involved, especially considering the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting affects migration behavior. Analyzing the 'create_test_db' method reveals that it handles the creation and setup of the test database, including the serialization of database contents, which is where the error manifests. The 'migrate' command's 'sync_apps' method is also relevant as it deals with syncing models to the database, which is crucial when migrations are skipped. The 'MigrationExecutor' class handles the actual migration process, which is bypassed when 'MIGRATE' is set to False in test settings.\n\nBased on the issue description and the provided search results, the relevant code spans are primarily located in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' within the 'BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db' method, which is directly involved in setting up the test database. Additionally, 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' contains the 'Command.sync_apps' method, which would be involved if migrations were not skipped. Lastly, 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' includes the 'MigrationExecutor' class, which manages migrations, though its direct relevance might be less in the context where migrations are intentionally skipped.",

  "initial_message": "Test runner setup_databases crashes with \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False}.\nDescription\n\t\nI'm trying to upgrade a project from Django 3.0 to Django 3.1 and wanted to try out the new \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} database setting.\nSadly I'm running into an issue immediately when running ./manage.py test.\nRemoving the \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} line allows the tests to run. So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
