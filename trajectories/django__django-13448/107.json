The traceback points to the missing 'django_admin_log' table, which suggests that the database setup logic for testing is not handling the no-migration scenario correctly. Investigating the DatabaseCreation class and related database backend files (particularly those handling test database creation) should shed light on the issue. I will focus the search on code related to the creation and handling of test databases.",

The code within this class handles the test database creation and the conditional migration call based on the 'MIGRATE' setting, which directly relates to the reported issue. Additionally, the 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' file, which contains the logic for the 'migrate' command, is also relevant as it indicates how migrations are managed and executed.

  "initial_message": "Test runner setup_databases crashes with \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False}.\nDescription\n\t\nI'm trying to upgrade a project from Django 3.0 to Django 3.1 and wanted to try out the new \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} database setting.\nSadly I'm running into an issue immediately when running ./manage.py test.\nRemoving the \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} line allows the tests to run. So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
