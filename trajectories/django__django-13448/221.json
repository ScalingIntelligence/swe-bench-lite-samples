The traceback indicates that the 'django_admin_log' table does not exist, which suggests that the database setup is failing when migrations are skipped. Analyzing the provided search results, two relevant files are identified: 'django/db/utils.py' and 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py'. In 'django/db/utils.py', the ConnectionHandler class includes the 'prepare_test_settings' method, which initializes the TEST settings for a connection, including the MIGRATE setting. This method is crucial as it sets up the test settings based on the provided configuration. In 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py', the BaseDatabaseCreation class contains methods related to creating and setting up test databases, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand. Specifically, the 'create_test_db' method is of particular interest, as it handles the creation of the test database and the subsequent migration process based on the TEST settings. This method includes a check for the MIGRATE setting, and if False, it skips the migration process, which aligns with the feature being used in the reported issue. These two files and the identified methods within them provide the necessary context to understand and potentially resolve the issue related to the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting and the ensuing database setup crash.
