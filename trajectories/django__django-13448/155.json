This is evident from the traceback provided, which points to the `create_test_db` method in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` as the source of the error. Specifically, the error occurs around the serialization of the database when migrations are skipped, leading to the absence of certain tables like 'django_admin_log'. The provided search results include relevant code spans within the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`. This includes the `create_test_db` method that handles the creation of the test database and determines whether to run migrations based on the settings. Additionally, the `serialize_db_to_string` method is also relevant as it is responsible for serializing the database contents into a string, which is used when `MIGRATE` is False and `SERIALIZE` is True. Given this analysis, the identified code spans are directly related to the issue at hand.",
