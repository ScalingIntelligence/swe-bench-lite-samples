The traceback indicates that the error occurs due to an undefined table 'django_admin_log' when skipping migrations. This suggests issues with the database setup during tests when migrations are skipped.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py', particularly the 'BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db' method. This method handles the creation of the test database and includes conditional checks for 'MIGRATE' in the 'TEST' settings dictionary. If 'MIGRATE' is False, it skips the migration process, which is likely where the issue arises.\n\nGiven the detailed traceback and the issue description, the identified code spans are directly related to the reported problem. These spans include critical functions such as '_create_test_db', 'serialize_db_to_string', and 'create_test_db', which are central to the database setup when running tests.

The crash occurs due to a missing table ('django_admin_log') during the test run. Given the traceback, the sequence of events suggests that the issue arises during the setup of the test database when attempting to serialize the database contents without running migrations. This serialization process likely tries to access tables that do not exist because migrations are skipped. The existing file context already provides relevant code spans related to the test database creation, specifically the 'create_test_db' and 'serialize_db_to_string' methods in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py'. The new search results primarily expand on the migration operations and the handling of model states during migrations, particularly in 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' and 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', providing deeper insight into how migrations and model operations are managed. This could be useful for understanding the impact of the 'MIGRATE': False setting on the database schema and data serialization during tests.",

The traceback points to Django's handling of the database creation and management processes, specifically when migrations are skipped. The file context provides detailed insights into how the test database is created and managed within Django's `BaseDatabaseCreation` class. Key methods include `create_test_db` and `serialize_db_to_string`, which handle the creation of the test database and the serialization of its contents, respectively. Notably, the `create_test_db` method checks the 'TEST' settings to determine whether migrations should be applied, and if 'MIGRATE' is False, it skips migrations. This behavior might be the cause of tables like 'django_admin_log' not being created, as they are typically part of the migration files. To further investigate and potentially resolve the issue, one should: 1) Examine the migration files that define the creation of the 'django_admin_log' table to understand how this table is supposed to be created and what dependencies it might have. 2) Look into whether, and how, the 'django_admin_log' table or similar tables are handled differently when migrations are skipped, particularly in the `serialize_db_to_string` method and related processes. 3) Check for any settings or configurations that might override or influence how the 'django_admin_log' table is treated in a test database context.

The traceback indicates that the crash is due to an attempt to access a non-existent table 'django_admin_log' during the test setup. This suggests that even though migrations are disabled, the test setup might still be trying to access certain tables that should be created by migrations.\n\nFrom the current context and search results, the relevant files seem to be 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' and 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py'. These files deal with database creation and migration operations, respectively, which are directly related to the issue. The method 'create_test_db' in 'BaseDatabaseCreation' class of 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' is particularly relevant as it handles the creation of test databases. This method is called during the test setup, and it contains logic related to migration handling based on the 'MIGRATE' setting.\n\nThe 'serialize_db_to_string' method in 'BaseDatabaseCreation' is also relevant, as it serializes the database to a string, which might involve accessing tables like 'django_admin_log'. Additionally, the 'generate_created_models' method in 'MigrationAutodetector' handles the creation of models, which could be related if the issue involves models expected but not created due to skipped migrations.\n\nOther files in the search results, such as 'django/db/migrations/operations/__init__.py', 'django/db/migrations/__init__.py', and 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', provide further context on migration operations and how they are managed or recorded, but they do not directly address the current issue.\n\nGiven the traceback and the context provided, focusing on the 'create_test_db' and 'serialize_db_to_string' methods in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py', as well as the 'generate_created_models' method in 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py', should help in further diagnosing why the non-existent table is being referenced, potentially indicating a gap in the handling of skipped migrations during test setup.",

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback. I'll try to debug this some more.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 84, in _execute\n\treturn self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\npsycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable: relation \"django_admin_log\" does not exist\nLINE 1: ...n_flag\", \"django_admin_log\".\"change_message\" FROM \"django_ad...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ^\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", line 1156, in execute_sql\n\tcursor.execute(sql, params)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 66, in execute\n\treturn self._execute_with_wrappers(sql, params, many=False, executor=self._execute)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 75, in _execute_with_wrappers\n\treturn executor(sql, params, many, context)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 84, in _execute\n\treturn self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/utils.py\", line 90, in __exit__\n\traise dj_exc_value.with_traceback(traceback) from exc_value\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 84, in _execute\n\treturn self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\ndjango.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation \"django_admin_log\" does not exist\nLINE 1: ...n_flag\", \"django_admin_log\".\"change_message\" FROM \"django_ad...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ^\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"./manage.py\", line 15, in <module>\n\tmain()\n File \"./manage.py\", line 11, in main\n\texecute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 401, in execute_from_command_line\n\tutility.execute()\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 395, in execute\n\tself.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/test.py\", line 23, in run_from_argv\n\tsuper().run_from_argv(argv)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 330, in run_from_argv\n\tself.execute(*args, **cmd_options)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 371, in execute\n\toutput = self.handle(*args, **options)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/test.py\", line 53, in handle\n\tfailures = test_runner.run_tests(test_labels)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/test/runner.py\", line 695, in run_tests\n\told_config = self.setup_databases(aliases=databases)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/test/runner.py\", line 616, in setup_databases\n\tself.parallel, **kwargs\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/test/utils.py\", line 174, in setup_databases\n\tserialize=connection.settings_dict['TEST'].get('SERIALIZE', True),\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", line 78, in create_test_db\n\tself.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", line 121, in serialize_db_to_string\n\tserializers.serialize(\"json\", get_objects(), indent=None, stream=out)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/serializers/__init__.py\", line 128, in serialize\n\ts.serialize(queryset, **options)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/serializers/base.py\", line 90, in serialize\n\tfor count, obj in enumerate(queryset, start=1):\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", line 118, in get_objects\n\tyield from queryset.iterator()\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 360, in _iterator\n\tyield from self._iterable_class(self, chunked_fetch=use_chunked_fetch, chunk_size=chunk_size)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 53, in __iter__\n\tresults = compiler.execute_sql(chunked_fetch=self.chunked_fetch, chunk_size=self.chunk_size)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", line 1159, in execute_sql\n\tcursor.close()\npsycopg2.errors.InvalidCursorName: cursor \"_django_curs_139860821038912_sync_1\" does not exist\n"
