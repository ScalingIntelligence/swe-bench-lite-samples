The error traceback suggests issues with database table relations during the test setup process, particularly when trying to serialize data without migrations being applied. Given the upgrade path from Django 1.4 to 3.1, it's possible that legacy configurations or models might be interacting with the new settings in unexpected ways. The search should focus on the database setup and test configuration within the project to identify where the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting is being applied and where the relevant code interacts with the database setup and table structures during the test run.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue hinges on the inability to use the new 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting introduced in Django 3.1 without encountering a crash when running tests. A key element to investigate here is how Django's migration system handles this setup, especially focusing on how this directive affects the creation and handling of test databases. The traceback indicates that the test runner is attempting to execute SQL that references a table ('django_admin_log') that does not exist, likely due to the 'MIGRATE': False setting preventing table creation via migrations.\n\nFrom the search results, several relevant code spans are identified: \n1. The `MigrationExecutor` class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py', particularly the methods `migrate` and `apply_migration` which orchestrate the migration process. These methods handle the applying of migrations during the test setup or in general usage, which may interact directly with the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting.\n2. In 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py', the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class and its method `_create_test_db` which sets up the test database. This function is crucial as it directly interfaces with the settings to determine the test database's creation behavior.\n3. Also in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py', the method `_get_test_db_name` likely to be used for fetching the name of the test database based on the settings.\n4. In 'django/conf/global_settings.py', the default settings for test runner and other parameters. Especially 'TEST_RUNNER' which might influence how the tests are started and how options like 'MIGRATE': False' are considered.\n\nThese code spans provide basic implementations and interactions that might be affecting the ability to use 'MIGRATE': False without causing a test runner to crash due to missing table references. More specifically, understanding how the migration system responds to this setting and whether it adequately prepares the test database environment (or lacks the preparations due to the setting) are central to addressing the issue.",

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
