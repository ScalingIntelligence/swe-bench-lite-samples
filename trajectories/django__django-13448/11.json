The search results include relevant files from the Django codebase, particularly focusing on the database creation and test database setup. The 'BaseDatabaseCreation' class in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' is a key component handling the test database creation, including the 'create_test_db' method which is central to the issue. The method conditionally calls 'migrate' based on the 'MIGRATE' setting in the 'TEST' configuration. Additionally, the 'DatabaseCreation' classes in 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py' and 'django/db/backends/postgresql/creation.py' provide backend-specific implementations of database creation, possibly affecting how the 'MIGRATE': False setting is handled. These files and methods appear relevant to understanding and resolving the issue, particularly how the 'MIGRATE' setting interacts with the database initialization and migration processes during testing.",

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
