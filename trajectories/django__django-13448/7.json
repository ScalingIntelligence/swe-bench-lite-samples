However, this causes the test runner to crash with a 'relation does not exist' error, indicating that some expected database tables are missing. The project has a significant history, having been upgraded from Django 1.4 to 3.0, and is now attempting an upgrade to 3.1. This legacy could be contributing to the issue. The traceback suggests that the problem originates in the database creation and setup phase, specifically when Django tries to serialize the database content during test setup. This serialization apparently fails due to the missing 'django_admin_log' table. To address this, it's crucial to pinpoint the exact point in the code where the test database setup is initiated and where the error occurs, especially focusing on the Django core management and database backend files related to test database creation and migration.",

The traceback indicates a `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable` error related to the `django_admin_log` table not existing. The error occurs specifically during the test database setup when trying to serialize the database contents.

The search results contain code spans from various Django database backend creation files that handle test database creation and management. These spans include methods like `_get_test_db_name`, `_create_test_db`, `_execute_create_test_db`, and `serialize_db_to_string`, which are crucial for understanding how the test databases are handled and potentially why the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting might be failing.

This context is important as it shows how each database backend handles the creation and cloning of test databases. The search results show the migration executor responsible for applying or unapplying migrations, which is crucial when testing with 'MIGRATE': False. It also shows how the executor handles detecting soft-applied migrations which could be related to the failure to identify tables like 'django_admin_log'. Additional analysis of the migration loader and recorder from the current file context would likely provide more insights into how applied migrations are tracked and interact with the test database setup process, specifically when bypassing migrations with 'MIGRATE': False.",

  "initial_message": "Test runner setup_databases crashes with \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False}.\nDescription\n\t\nI'm trying to upgrade a project from Django 3.0 to Django 3.1 and wanted to try out the new \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} database setting.\nSadly I'm running into an issue immediately when running ./manage.py test.\nRemoving the \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} line allows the tests to run. So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
