The error relates to database migrations and the absence of the 'django_admin_log' table, indicating that some critical tables might be missing due to the skipped migrations. Potential areas to investigate include the setup_databases function in Django's test runner, the database configuration and creation logic in django/db/backends/*, and the migration execution and serialization processes in django/db/migrations/*. Given the extensive upgrade from Django 1.4 to 3.1, legacy configurations and handling might also contribute to the issue.",

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
