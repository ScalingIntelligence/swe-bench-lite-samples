The traceback indicates that the crash occurs because a required table ('django_admin_log') does not exist in the database, which would normally be created by the migration process. This suggests that there may be assumptions in the code that rely on migrations being run even when 'MIGRATE' is set to False. The search results include the 'BaseDatabaseCreation' class in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py', which is responsible for creating test databases. Specifically, the method 'create_test_db' handles the creation of test databases and includes logic to optionally run migrations or serialize the database. Since the issue is directly related to the creation of the test database and its setup process, the relevant code spans are those where the 'create_test_db' method logic exists, as this would be the entry point for setting up the test database without migrations. Therefore, focusing on 'BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db' is crucial for identifying how the system handles the 'MIGRATE': False setting and where it might be failing or making assumptions about the state of the database.",

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
