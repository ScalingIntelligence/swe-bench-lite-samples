This is part of the Django 3.1 feature set, and the crash occurs when running tests. The traceback indicates that the error is related to a missing database table ('django_admin_log'). This suggests that the test setup is trying to access a table that doesn't exist because migrations are skipped. \n\nTo address this issue, we need to identify the parts of the code responsible for handling the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting and the database setup during testing. The search results include several files from the Django codebase, notably: \n1. django/conf/global_settings.py - This file contains global settings for Django, including TEST_RUNNER.\n2. django/db/utils.py - This file contains the ConnectionHandler and ConnectionRouter classes, which handle database connections and routing, including the prepare_test_settings method.\n3. django/db/migrations/executor.py - This file contains the MigrationExecutor class, which manages the execution of database migrations.\n4. django/core/management/commands/migrate.py - This file contains the Command class for the 'migrate' management command.\n5. django/db/backends/base/creation.py - This file contains the BaseDatabaseCreation class, which handles the creation of test databases, including the create_test_db method.\n\nRelevant code spans include:\n- ConnectionHandler.prepare_test_settings in django/db/utils.py, which prepares test settings for a database connection.\n- MigrationExecutor.migrate and related methods in django/db/migrations/executor.py, which handle the migration process.\n- BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db in django/db/backends/base/creation.py, which creates a test database and controls the migration process during test setup.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they include the logic that manages the 'MIGRATE' setting during the setup of test databases and the execution of migrations.

The traceback indicates that the issue arises from an attempt to access a table ('django_admin_log') that does not exist, which suggests that despite setting 'MIGRATE' to False, some part of the codebase is still trying to perform migrations or access non-existent tables. Identifying the relevant code spans involves looking at how the TEST settings are handled and specifically how the 'MIGRATE' flag is interpreted and respected across different parts of the system, including the creation of test databases and the execution of migrations.\n\nFirst, we should review the existing context to understand where the 'TEST' settings are processed and applied. The code spans from 'django/db/utils.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' indicate that there are already identified sections where the database connections are managed and migrations are handled. This context helps in understanding how the 'MIGRATE' flag might impact these operations.\n\nNext, examining the new search results, we find supplementary code spans in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' that show the creation of test databases and the handling of the 'MIGRATE' flag explicitly in the 'create_test_db' method. Additionally, 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py' provides specific handling of test databases for SQLite, which might have distinct behaviors related to migrations and database creation.\n\nThe identified code spans provide a detailed look into how the test databases are set up and how the 'MIGRATE' flag from the 'TEST' settings is being processed. This analysis will help in determining whether the provided search results are relevant to the reported issue and if further analysis is required. The 'create_test_db' method in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' is particularly relevant as it directly addresses the creation of test databases and the handling of migrations, which is central to the reported issue.",
