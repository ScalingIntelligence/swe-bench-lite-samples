The traceback indicates that the error is related to a missing 'django_admin_log' table, suggesting that some essential migrations are not being applied. Given the recent upgrade path from Django 1.4 to 3.1, there could be legacy configurations or settings that conflict with the new feature. The goal is to find code related to the test database setup and migration handling to determine why the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting causes the crash.",

The traceback indicates that the error occurs when trying to access the 'django_admin_log' table, which does not exist. This suggests that the database is not being properly set up or migrated when 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} is used. The search results provide insights into how Django handles test database creation and migration settings. Specifically, the 'BaseDatabaseCreation' class in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' has methods for creating and serializing test databases, which might be relevant to the issue. Additionally, the 'Command' class in 'django/core/management/commands/test.py' handles the execution of tests, including setting up databases. These sections could contain the necessary code to understand and potentially resolve the issue related to skipping migrations during testing.",

However, the context does show the logic for handling the 'TEST':{'MIGRATE': False} setting, which indicates that migrations are not applied if this setting is False.

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
