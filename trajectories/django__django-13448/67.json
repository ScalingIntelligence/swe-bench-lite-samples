The traceback indicates an error related to the 'django_admin_log' table not existing, which suggests that when migrations are skipped, some essential tables might not be created, leading to this crash. In the provided search results, the relevant code span is in the 'create_test_db' method of the 'BaseDatabaseCreation' class within 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py'. This method checks the 'MIGRATE' setting and, if True, runs migrations. The error likely occurs because with 'MIGRATE' set to False, the necessary tables for the tests are not being created. This code span is directly related to the issue reported, as it handles the creation of the test database and the decision to run migrations or not based on the 'MIGRATE' setting in the TEST dictionary.

This suggests that the Django test setup is not correctly handling the skipping of migrations when this setting is active. The provided context shows the relevant section in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' where the 'create_test_db' method handles database creation for tests, including the part where it checks the 'MIGRATE' setting and skips migrations if it's set to False. The search results provide additional context: 'django/db/utils.py' has code related to database handling and settings, and the 'prepare_test_settings' method within 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' ensures default test settings including 'MIGRATE'. Other sections in 'django/db/backends/*/creation.py' files show implementations specific to PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle databases, detailing how they handle test database creation, including specific error handling for duplicate databases. These all relate to the core functionality around database setup for testing, significant because the issue arises when trying to use the 'MIGRATE' setting to skip migrations. Given this context, the relevant code spans focus on the parts of the codebase that are directly involved in test database creation and handling the 'MIGRATE' setting, indicating where the issue might be occurring or where modifications might be needed to resolve the reported problem.",

This problem is occurring during the setup of the test databases. The traceback indicates that the issue is related to a missing table 'django_admin_log'. From the existing file context and new search results, several key areas are relevant:\n\n1. The 'create_test_db' method in 'BaseDatabaseCreation' sets up the test database and checks the 'TEST' settings to determine whether to run migrations. This method is crucial for understanding how the 'MIGRATE' setting is handled.\n\n2. The '_execute_create_test_db' method in 'BaseDatabaseCreation' is responsible for creating the test database. This method is overridden in various database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle) to handle specific database behaviors.\n\n3. The 'prepare_test_settings' method in 'ConnectionHandler' is responsible for setting the default test settings, including 'MIGRATE'. Understanding how this method works can provide insight into how the 'MIGRATE' setting is initialized and managed.\n\n4. The 'serialize_db_to_string' method in 'BaseDatabaseCreation' is used to serialize the database contents into a string, which is essential for testing. The traceback suggests an issue during this serialization process, possibly due to the missing table.\n\nGiven the specific crash related to 'django_admin_log', it seems likely that the issue involves the database state when 'MIGRATE' is set to False, causing tables not to be created. The identified code spans are crucial for understanding and resolving this issue.",

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback. I'll try to debug this some more.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 84, in _execute\n\treturn self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\npsycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable: relation \"django_admin_log\" does not exist\nLINE 1: ...n_flag\", \"django_admin_log\".\"change_message\" FROM \"django_ad...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ^\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", line 1156, in execute_sql\n\tcursor.execute(sql, params)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 66, in execute\n\treturn self._execute_with_wrappers(sql, params, many=False, executor=self._execute)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 75, in _execute_with_wrappers\n\treturn executor(sql, params, many, context)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 84, in _execute\n\treturn self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/utils.py\", line 90, in __exit__\n\traise dj_exc_value.with_traceback(traceback) from exc_value\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/utils.py\", line 84, in _execute\n\treturn self.cursor.execute(sql, params)\ndjango.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation \"django_admin_log\" does not exist\nLINE 1: ...n_flag\", \"django_admin_log\".\"change_message\" FROM \"django_ad...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ^\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"./manage.py\", line 15, in <module>\n\tmain()\n File \"./manage.py\", line 11, in main\n\texecute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 401, in execute_from_command_line\n\tutility.execute()\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 395, in execute\n\tself.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/test.py\", line 23, in run_from_argv\n\tsuper().run_from_argv(argv)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 330, in run_from_argv\n\tself.execute(*args, **cmd_options)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/base.py\", line 371, in execute\n\toutput = self.handle(*args, **options)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/management/commands/test.py\", line 53, in handle\n\tfailures = test_runner.run_tests(test_labels)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/test/runner.py\", line 695, in run_tests\n\told_config = self.setup_databases(aliases=databases)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/test/runner.py\", line 616, in setup_databases\n\tself.parallel, **kwargs\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/test/utils.py\", line 174, in setup_databases\n\tserialize=connection.settings_dict['TEST'].get('SERIALIZE', True),\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", line 78, in create_test_db\n\tself.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", line 121, in serialize_db_to_string\n\tserializers.serialize(\"json\", get_objects(), indent=None, stream=out)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/serializers/__init__.py\", line 128, in serialize\n\ts.serialize(queryset, **options)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/serializers/base.py\", line 90, in serialize\n\tfor count, obj in enumerate(queryset, start=1):\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", line 118, in get_objects\n\tyield from queryset.iterator()\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 360, in _iterator\n\tyield from self._iterable_class(self, chunked_fetch=use_chunked_fetch, chunk_size=chunk_size)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/query.py\", line 53, in __iter__\n\tresults = compiler.execute_sql(chunked_fetch=self.chunked_fetch, chunk_size=self.chunk_size)\n File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", line 1159, in execute_sql\n\tcursor.close()\npsycopg2.errors.InvalidCursorName: cursor \"_django_curs_139860821038912_sync_1\" does not exist\n"
