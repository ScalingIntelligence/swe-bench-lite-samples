The traceback indicates a problem with the `django_admin_log` table when the test databases are being set up.

Given the recent upgrade through several Django versions, it's possible that legacy database configurations or older migration scripts could be the root cause.

The traceback indicates a problem related to the existence of a specific table, 'django_admin_log', during the test execution. The search results provide several code spans that are likely relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **django/db/migrations/executor.py** - This file is crucial for understanding how Django handles migrations, including the setup and execution of migration plans. The MigrationExecutor class methods such as __init__, migrate, _migrate_all_forwards, apply_migration, and detect_soft_applied are directly involved in the migration process and might hold the key to understanding why the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting is causing issues.\n\n2. **django/conf/global_settings.py** - This file contains global settings for Django, including settings related to test runners (TEST_RUNNER) and migration modules (MIGRATION_MODULES). Although the specific 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting is not directly found here, understanding the default behavior and configuration of test runners might provide context for the issue.\n\n3. **django/db/migrations/questioner.py** - This file contains the MigrationQuestioner class, which is responsible for asking questions during the interactive parts of migrations. Although less directly relevant, understanding how migrations handle interaction could provide additional context.\n\n4. **django/db/backends/base/creation.py** - This file contains the BaseDatabaseCreation class, which includes methods for creating test databases. The create_test_db method is particularly relevant as it handles the creation of test databases with the option to run migrations (or not) based on the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting. This method could be where the issue with the 'django_admin_log' table arises.\n\nGiven the traceback and the context of attempting to use the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting, the code spans in the django/db/migrations/executor.py and django/db/backends/base/creation.py files are the most relevant for debugging the issue. Specifically, the MigrationExecutor class methods and the create_test_db method in BaseDatabaseCreation will be crucial for understanding and resolving the problem.",
