The traceback indicates a problem when the code tries to serialize the database contents to a string during the test database setup process. This suggests a potential issue with the method `serialize_db_to_string` in the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class. Given the context that the project is undergoing an upgrade from Django 1.4 to 3.1, there might be old settings or configurations that interfere with the new feature.

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
