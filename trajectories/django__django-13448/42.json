The traceback indicates an error related to the 'django_admin_log' table not existing, suggesting issues with database setup or migration handling. The search should focus on Django's database creation and setup logic, especially in the context of test databases, to identify any legacy code or configurations that might conflict with the new setting. Specifically, the focus should be on the 'django/db/backends' directory, which contains the backend-specific database creation logic.",

The traceback indicates that the error occurs during the serialization of the database to a string when migrations are skipped. The provided search results contain various code spans from different database backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle) and the base creation class in Django. The key parts to look for are the methods related to test database creation, destruction, and the handling of the 'MIGRATE' setting. From the base creation class, the `create_test_db` method is relevant as it handles the creation of the test database and manages the migration setting. Specifically, the `if self.connection.settings_dict['TEST']['MIGRATE']: ...` block and the `if serialize: self.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()` part are crucial for understanding how the database serialization is handled with and without migrations. Additionally, other backend-specific methods in the search results, such as `_get_test_db_name` and `_create_test_db`, are pertinent as they deal with the naming and creation of test databases, including how they handle the 'TEST' settings. These methods hint at potential points of conflict or conditions that might not be met when 'MIGRATE' is set to False, leading to the undefined table error.",

  "initial_message": "Test runner setup_databases crashes with \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False}.\nDescription\n\t\nI'm trying to upgrade a project from Django 3.0 to Django 3.1 and wanted to try out the new \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} database setting.\nSadly I'm running into an issue immediately when running ./manage.py test.\nRemoving the \"TEST\": {\"MIGRATE\": False} line allows the tests to run. So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
