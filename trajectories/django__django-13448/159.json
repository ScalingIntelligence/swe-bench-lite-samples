This issue could be related to the legacy setup or the new setting itself. The search results include several relevant files and spans: \n1. django/db/utils.py - Contains the ConnectionHandler class which handles database connections settings.\n2. django/conf/global_settings.py - Defines global settings including the default DATABASE settings.\n3. django/db/backends/base/creation.py - Includes the BaseDatabaseCreation class which deals with creating databases, relevant due to the TEST setting handling.\n4. django/db/backends/postgresql/base.py - The DatabaseWrapper class for PostgreSQL, which interacts with the databases directly.\n5. django/db/backends/oracle/creation.py - The DatabaseCreation class for Oracle, although not directly PostgreSQL, handles database-related creation.\n\nThe identified spans focus on database settings handling ('databases' property in ConnectionHandler), default settings in global_settings, and methods related to database creation and test database creation in BaseDatabaseCreation. These spans are critical to understanding how database settings are handled, particularly in test environments and might contain the necessary details to identify why the 'TEST' setting is causing issues.",

However, the issue persists because the test database setup still assumes the presence of certain tables when 'MIGRATE' is set to False. Further refinement is required in the 'create_test_db' method to ensure that operations involving these tables are skipped when 'MIGRATE' is False. The existing change partially addresses this by removing serialization logic for the test database, but additional checks and conditions are needed to handle all operations that depend on the existence of migration-created tables.",

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
