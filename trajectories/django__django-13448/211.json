This prevents migrations from being applied during testing, which might expose issues in the database setup or how the test database is being created and populated. Given the legacy nature of the project, it's possible that there are outdated settings or configurations that are not compatible with the new feature. The traceback points to errors related to undefined tables ('django_admin_log' does not exist) and issues with cursor handling in PostgreSQL. To debug this, we need to examine the database creation logic and settings in Django, particularly in the files related to database backend, creation, and migrations, focusing on how test databases are being handled and how settings might be affecting this process.",

This seems to be related to the database setup for testing, particularly how the test database is created and used when migrations are skipped. The traceback indicates an issue with the 'django_admin_log' table, suggesting that the error might be due to the serializer trying to access this table during the setup phase when migrations are skipped.\n\nLooking at the search results, several files and code spans are relevant to the issue. These include:\n\n1. **django/core/management/commands/migrate.py**: This file contains the logic for the 'migrate' command, which is crucial for handling database migrations. The 'handle' method is where the migration execution logic resides.\n\n2. **django/db/backends/base/creation.py**: This file is responsible for database creation operations, such as creating a test database. The '_get_test_db_name' and 'serialize_db_to_string' methods are particularly relevant as they handle the test database name and serialization of database contents, respectively.\n\n3. **django/core/management/commands/test.py**: This file contains the logic for the 'test' command, which triggers the test runner. The 'handle' method triggers the test execution, potentially where the error gets thrown.\n\n4. **django/db/backends/postgresql/creation.py**: This file contains backend-specific database creation operations which can give better insight if a PostgreSQL database is used.\n\nFrom the code spans, the most relevant ones are:\n\n- 'handle' method in 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py': This method handles the execution of the migration command, directly related to the database operations during migration.\n- 'handle' method in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py': This method handles database creation including test database which is critical when 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} is used.\n- 'handle' method in 'django/core/management/commands/test.py': This method triggers the test execution, where the issue is likely originating from.\n\nThese code spans are directly related to the reported issue as they deal with database migration execution, test database creation, and test execution - all of which are central to the issue description.",

The traceback indicates that the error occurs due to the 'django_admin_log' table not existing, which might be related to how the test database is being set up or how serialization of database states is handled when migrations are skipped. The search results include several key files and functions that might be relevant to solving the issue:\n\n1. **django/db/backends/base/creation.py** - This file contains the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class which is responsible for creating databases, including the test database. The `serialize_db_to_string` method within this class is likely involved in the serialization process which fails in the traceback.\n\n2. **django/db/utils.py** - Contains the `ConnectionHandler` class which prepares test settings, including the 'TEST' settings which control the database for testing. Specifically, the `prepare_test_settings` method sets defaults for the TEST dictionary, which should include 'MIGRATE'.\n\n3. **django/db/migrations/executor.py** - The `MigrationExecutor` class is core to the migration process. The `migrate` method applies migration plans to the database, and the issue might relate to how this interacts with the test database setup when 'MIGRATE' is set to False.\n\nBy analyzing these parts of the codebase, it should be possible to identify where the process is failing when 'MIGRATE' is set to False and the Django project is expecting certain tables or data to exist.",

So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.\nFor reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.\nHere's the trackeback.
