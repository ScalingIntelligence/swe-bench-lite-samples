In the span 'ManualPageBuilder.write', the method handles the writing of individual man pages. This method is responsible for placing the generated pages into the output directory (`self.outdir`). Importantly, it constructs the target file name using the section of each man page. This indicates that implementing a directory structure based on the section should be addressed here. If we modify the `destination_path` to include the section as a subdirectory, we can ensure the proper directory structure.\n2. The 'ManualPageBuilder.finish' method is iterated upon, and there is room to implement additional logic here to ensure the organizational structure of the output directory, like creating necessary subdirectories or handling post-build tidy-ups.\nOverall, based on the provided code and the issue at hand, these spans are critical for devising a solution that aligns with the MANPATH functionality.",

The current implementation places all man pages in a single-level directory (`<build-dir>/man`), which does not conform to this requirement. The relevant part of the codebase appears to be within the `ManualPageBuilder` class in `sphinx/builders/manpage.py`. Specifically, the `write` method needs to be adjusted to create the appropriate section directories (e.g., `man/man1`, `man/man3`, etc.) and place each generated man page within the correct section. Existing code spans show how man pages are currently written to the output directory, but do not handle the creation of section directories.\n\nFrom the new search results, it is evident that the `write` method still lacks the functionality to create section directories. The `destination_path` within the `write` method should be adjusted to include the section directory, ensuring that the file path is correctly structured. The `finish` method might also need adjustments to confirm that all necessary section directories are created if not already handled in the `write` method. The `init` and `get_outdated_docs` methods do not directly relate to the issue at hand, but the `write` and potentially `finish` methods need to be addressed for a complete solution.",

Unfortunately, this cannot be used in combination with the unix `MANPATH` environment variable. The `man` program explicitly looks for man pages in section directories (such as `man/man1`, etc.). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if sphinx would automatically create the section directories (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.) and place each generated man page within appropriate section.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThis problem can be over come within our project\u2019s build system, ensuring the built man pages are installed in a correct location, but it would be nice if the build directory had the proper layout.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to take a crack at implementing a fix, though this change in behavior may break some people who expect everything to appear in a `man/` directory. \r\n\n"
