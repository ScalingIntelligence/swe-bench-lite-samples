Currently, the man pages are all being placed in a single-level directory (`<build-dir>/man`), which does not support the section-based directory structure required by the `man` program (`man/man1`, `man/man3`, etc.). The solution described involves creating these section directories and placing each generated man page within the appropriate section.\n\nIn the provided search results, I found the `sphinx/builders/manpage.py` file which contains the `ManualPageBuilder` class that is responsible for building the man pages. This class's `write` method processes each man page and attempts to output it into the build directory. The current implementation places the files directly into `self.outdir`, which is likely the root of the man directory. To conform to the `MANPATH` standard, we need to modify this method to create subdirectories based on the man page section and place the pages there.\n\nWhat would make the search results complete in my opinion is if there was also context around any default configurations or specification of man sections to ensure that the logic for deciding these subfolders' creation is consistent with expected input and project structure, depending on the default configurations for _man_pages_ in `setup`. At the moment, however, there isn't anything in the context or results that ensures a handling specific to `/manX` folders where X is the unique man section/category\n\nThe provided spans do mark the relevant portions of the `sphinx/builders/manpage.py` file which needs to be further examined and revamped in context of the described problem. However, without the complete parsing across files, it is hard to conclusively deem this search exhaustive yet unless there are additional keywords/contexts that might suggest the requirement for new functionality or parts of the existing code that operate outside the identified spans.",

  "initial_message": "Generate man page section directories\n**Current man page generation does not conform to `MANPATH` search functionality**\r\nCurrently, all generated man pages are placed in to a single-level directory: `<build-dir>/man`. Unfortunately, this cannot be used in combination with the unix `MANPATH` environment variable. The `man` program explicitly looks for man pages in section directories (such as `man/man1`, etc.). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if sphinx would automatically create the section directories (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.) and place each generated man page within appropriate section.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThis problem can be over come within our project\u2019s build system, ensuring the built man pages are installed in a correct location, but it would be nice if the build directory had the proper layout.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to take a crack at implementing a fix, though this change in behavior may break some people who expect everything to appear in a `man/` directory. \r\n\n"
