Specifically, it requires that man pages be placed in appropriate section directories like `man/man1`, `man/man3`, etc., rather than a single-level directory. Given the context, the relevant file seems to be 'sphinx/builders/manpage.py' which contains the definition of ManualPageBuilder responsible for building man pages. Additionally, there are mentions of automatic directory creation, which could suggest looking into other utility functions or methods involved in directory management or path manipulation within Sphinx. It's also worth checking if any global configurations or default behaviors related to man page construction might need adjustment, perhaps in 'doc/conf.py' or similar configuration files. Furthermore, it's logical to inspect the finishing steps defined in 'sphinx/builders/manpage.py' under the 'finish' method, as these could be where adjustments to directory structure are needed.",

By analyzing the provided search results, the key areas of interest are the `ManualPageBuilder` class in `sphinx/builders/manpage.py` and the configuration settings in `doc/conf.py`. In `sphinx/builders/manpage.py`, the `ManualPageBuilder` class is responsible for building man pages but lacks the necessary logic to organize them into section directories. Additionally, there is a `default_man_pages` function that defines the default man pages without considering section directories. In `doc/conf.py`, the `man_pages` configuration lists potential man pages with their respective sections, which can serve as a basis for organizing them correctly. To address the issue, modifications will need to be made in the `ManualPageBuilder` class to check the section number specified in the `man_pages` configuration and organize the output directories accordingly.",

Unfortunately, this cannot be used in combination with the unix `MANPATH` environment variable. The `man` program explicitly looks for man pages in section directories (such as `man/man1`, etc.). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if sphinx would automatically create the section directories (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.) and place each generated man page within appropriate section.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThis problem can be over come within our project\u2019s build system, ensuring the built man pages are installed in a correct location, but it would be nice if the build directory had the proper layout.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to take a crack at implementing a fix, though this change in behavior may break some people who expect everything to appear in a `man/` directory. \r\n\n"
