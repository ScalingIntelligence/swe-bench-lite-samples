The current implementation places all generated man pages into a single-level directory, which does not conform to the expected structure. To address this, the relevant code spans need to be identified that handle the creation and placement of man pages. The analysis of the `sphinx/builders/manpage.py` file reveals the `ManualPageBuilder` class, which is responsible for the man page generation. Specifically, the `write` method of this class places the generated man pages into the `outdir` directory without creating section subdirectories. This behavior aligns with the current issue, as it does not support the `MANPATH` structure. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those that involve the generation and placement of man pages, particularly in the `write` method of the `ManualPageBuilder` class. These spans need to be modified to create and place files into appropriate section directories, such as `man/man1`, `man/man3`, etc.",

Unfortunately, this cannot be used in combination with the unix `MANPATH` environment variable. The `man` program explicitly looks for man pages in section directories (such as `man/man1`, etc.). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if sphinx would automatically create the section directories (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.) and place each generated man page within appropriate section.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThis problem can be over come within our project\u2019s build system, ensuring the built man pages are installed in a correct location, but it would be nice if the build directory had the proper layout.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to take a crack at implementing a fix, though this change in behavior may break some people who expect everything to appear in a `man/` directory. \r\n\n"
