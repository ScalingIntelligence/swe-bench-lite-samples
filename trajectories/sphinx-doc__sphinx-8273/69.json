In Unix-like systems, the `MANPATH` environment variable expects man pages to be in subdirectories corresponding to the section numbers (e.g., `man1`, `man3`, etc.). Currently, all pages are placed in a single directory (`<build-dir>/man`), which does not align with `MANPATH` functionality. It is necessary to adapt Sphinx to generate the pages in a section-specific directory structure.\n\nReviewing the code for `ManualPageBuilder` in `manpage.py`, several key areas are identified. The key part of the existing code structure where the change is likely to occur is the `write` method. This method currently generates manual pages without respect to their intended sections. The large tree of available documents ('LargeTree') and each target's name (referred as 'targetname') are undergoing the formation process. Thus, I will aim specifically at this function to note modifications that will necessitate the practical creation of directory structures that enhance the voting section. It will adjusted this part of computing in order to carry out the said modifications.\n\nUsing the above considerations, I can now recommend files and spans that may currently be related to this functionality as 'calculated candidates'.",

Current code structures place all man pages in a single directory, which does not conform to this standard. The search results for the issue must aim to identify how to modify the code to include section directories. The primary context can be found in the ManualPageBuilder class within the `sphinx/builders/manpage.py` file, particularly in the `write` method where the output directory (`self.outdir`) is specified. This location currently does not create or use any subdirectories based on the man page section. A promising area in the new search results is the `osutil.py`, which contains utility functions for file path handling, such as `os_path` and `canon_path`. These functions might be leveraged to handle section directories effectively. Since the main requirement is to ensure man pages are placed in the right section directory, focusing on how to modify the `write` method in the ManualPageBuilder class to achieve this would be crucial. Therefore, the identified relevant code span is the `os` and path handling functions within `osutil.py` which can potentially assist in organizing man pages into section directories.",

The `man` program explicitly looks for man pages in section directories (such as `man/man1`, etc.). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if sphinx would automatically create the section directories (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.) and place each generated man page within appropriate section.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThis problem can be over come within our project\u2019s build system, ensuring the built man pages are installed in a correct location, but it would be nice if the build directory had the proper layout.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to take a crack at implementing a fix, though this change in behavior may break some people who expect everything to appear in a `man/` directory. \r\n\n"
