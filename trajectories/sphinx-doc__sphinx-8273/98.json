Unfortunately, this cannot be used in combination with the unix `MANPATH` environment variable. The `man` program explicitly looks for man pages in section directories (such as `man/man1`, etc.). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if sphinx would automatically create the section directories (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.) and place each generated man page within appropriate section.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThis problem can be over come within our project\u2019s build system, ensuring the built man pages are installed in a correct location, but it would be nice if the build directory had the proper layout.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m happy to take a crack at implementing a fix, though this change in behavior may break some people who expect everything to appear in a `man/` directory. \r\n\n"
