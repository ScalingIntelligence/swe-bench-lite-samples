The current implementation seems to return subclasses of `Atom` when called without arguments, but the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`. Given the context provided, it's clear that the `atoms()` method is defined in the `Basic` class, and the `Atom` class directly inherits from `Basic`. To fix the issue, we should look for the `atoms()` method within the `Basic` class and relevant subclasses to ensure it adheres to the correct definition. Additionally, we might need to adjust the classes that further inherit from `Atom` such as `AtomicExpr` in `sympy/core/expr.py`, and possibly others.",

The issue requires a change in the definition of a leaf node from being a subclass of `Atom` to having no `.args`. This involves modifying the `Basic.atoms()` method to check for the absence of `.args` instead of using `isinstance(expr, types)`. So, I looked for related files and code spans that might be relevant for making this change. I found two main files with relevant code spans: `sympy/core/basic.py` (where the `Basic` class is defined) and `sympy/core/expr.py` (where the `Expr` class is defined and potentially could be impacted by the change).\n\nSpecifically, the identified spans are:\n- `sympy/core/basic.py` > `Basic.atoms`: This is the method that needs to be modified.\n- `sympy/core/basic.py` > `Atom`: This class definition is where the current logic for atoms is defined and it will likely be impacted by the change.\n\nMore broadly, examining the `Expr` class and related methods in `sympy/core/expr.py` is logical to ensure no adverse impacts from changing how atoms are identified. These additional spans include:\n- `sympy/core/expr.py` > `Expr.equals`, `Expr.is_polynomial`, `Expr.is_rational_function`, `Expr.is_algebraic_expr`, `Expr.taylor_term`, `Expr.as_leading_term`, `AtomicExpr` : These methods might have logic that relies on the current definition of atoms and thus deserve closer inspection.\n\nAdditionally, the `AtomicExpr` class descendants in `sympy/core/expr.py` also appear to define behaviors relevant to leaf nodes, indicating that care should be taken to ensure changes do not disrupt any part of the expression handling in `sympy/core/expr.py`.",
