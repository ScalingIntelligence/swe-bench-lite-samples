The provided search results show relevant files and spans, especially `sympy/core/expr.py` which defines `Expr` and `AtomicExpr`. The `atoms` method is also defined in `sympy/core/basic.py` within the `Basic` class, and in `sympy/matrices/common.py` within the `MatrixProperties` class. I identified the spans in `sympy/core/expr.py` (`Expr` and `AtomicExpr` classes) as they seem to be directly related to the issue. Additionally, the `atoms` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` is also relevant as it's a more generalized implementation that `Expr` would likely inherit or interact with.

The requirement is to modify the definition of a leaf node to be an object with no `.args` instead of just being a subclass of `Atom`. \n\nThe current context includes the `Expr` class and the `Basic` class with the `atoms` method. The `Expr` class does not directly handle the `atoms` method, leaving it to the `Basic` class. The `atoms` method in `Basic` uses `preorder_traversal` to traverse the expression tree and collect atoms based on the types specified or defaults to collecting all subclasses of `Atom` if no types are specified. This method needs to be adjusted to consider nodes with no `.args` as leaf nodes.\n\nThe new search results confirm the current implementation of the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class, which defaults to collecting all subclasses of `Atom`. This method needs to change to filter nodes by checking if they have `.args` and only include those without `.args` in the result. Additionally, the `args` property in the `Basic` class is used to access the arguments of an expression, which will be necessary to implement the new definition of leaf nodes.\n\nGiven these details, the identified relevant code spans are the `atoms` method and the `args` property in the `Basic` class.

The current implementation primarily relies on instances of specified types, rather than expressions that do not have `.args`. However, there are instances in the code where expressions do not have `.args`, such as in the `AtomicExpr` class. Thus, the relevant part of the code where a change would occur is identified in the `atoms` method within the `Basic` class, which could be extended to include a check for expressions that do not have `.args`. This involves modifying the existing `atoms` method to also consider expressions without `.args` as leaf nodes, which aligns with the described functionality requested in the issue.
