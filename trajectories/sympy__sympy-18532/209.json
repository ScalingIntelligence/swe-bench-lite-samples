This problem can be resolved by ensuring that the `atoms()` function in the `Basic` class checks for leaf nodes based on whether they have `.args`. In the provided context, the `Basic` class definition includes the `_args` attribute and the `atoms()` method. This method currently checks if an expression is an instance of the types provided (or `Atom` by default). With the issue definition, one should change the `atoms()` method to also check if the expressions have no `.args`. This will ensure that only true leaf nodes are returned. Therefore, extracting only the `atoms()` method's implementation from the `Basic` class is crucial to correctly associate the reported issue with the actual code that needs to be addressed.",
