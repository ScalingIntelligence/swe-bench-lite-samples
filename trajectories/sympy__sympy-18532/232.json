The current implementation in `sympy/core/basic.py` under the `Basic` class has an `atoms` method that checks if the expression is an instance of `types`, which defaults to `(Atom,)`. However, the issue suggests that the correct criterion for a 'leaf' node should be the absence of `.args`. This implies a change in the `atoms` method to filter based on the presence of `.args`. \n\nExamining the `Basic` class, there is a method `args` that returns `self._args`, which are the arguments of the expression. This method is crucial for determining if an expression has any arguments. Furthermore, the class `Basic` has a property `_args` that holds the arguments of the instance, and this is what should be checked to identify if an expression has no arguments. \n\nIn the provided search results, there is a detailed definition of the `Basic` class and its methods. The `Basic.atoms` method currently filters atoms based on type, but it needs to be adjusted to filter based on the absence of `.args`. The `Basic.args` property can be used to determine if an instance has arguments. \n\nGiven this context, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those related to the `Basic` class, especially its `atoms` method and the `args` property.",
