To address this, focus on the implementation of `atoms()` method and the `Atom` class to ensure the right criteria are used for identifying leaf nodes. Given the context, investigating the `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` files is crucial. Additionally, glance at `sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py` as it may relate to how atoms are handled when lambdifying expressions.
