There's also a mention of a subclass, `Permutation`, in 'sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py', which, although not directly inheriting from `Expr`, might be using the `atoms` method in a way that impacts performance or behavior. It's crucial to check how these classes interact with `atoms` and if they override or significantly use this method differently.

The current definition seems to return subclasses of `Atom` when no arguments are provided to `expr.atoms()`. However, the correct definition should be those objects that have no `.args`. This requires adjustments in the `atoms()` method to check for whether the object has `.args` and if it does, it should not be included in the result. The issue references `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. Upon reviewing the existing code and the new search results, it's clear that the `atoms()` method in both `Basic` class (sympy/core/basic.py) and `Permutation` class (sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py) needs to be modified to meet the new definition of a leaf node. Further, the code has revealed additional references and methods within the `Basic` class that might help in implementing the new functionality or adjusting the current one to align with the reported issue.",
