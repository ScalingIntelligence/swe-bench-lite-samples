The issue highlights that `expr.atoms()` currently returns subclasses of `Atom` when no arguments are passed, whereas it should return objects without `.args`. In the `Basic` class within `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `atoms` method includes a default behavior that sets `types` to `(Atom,)` if no types are provided, which is the source of the problem. The solution involves altering the `atoms` method to check for objects with no `.args` instead of considering subclasses of `Atom`. Additionally, the `Basic` class must be revised such that an object with no `.args` is correctly identified as a leaf node. This revision will ensure the method's correctness and verify that this change does not negatively impact the performance or functionality of other methods in the class.",
