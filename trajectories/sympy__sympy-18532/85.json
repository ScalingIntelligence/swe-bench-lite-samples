The files provided show the context in which `Basic` and `Expr` classes are defined, indicating where the `atoms` method might be implemented or used. To address this, a search should be conducted to locate the `atoms` method and the relevant subclasses of `Atom` that are being returned. Given the context, the search should focus on the `sympy/core/` directory and specifically look for the `atoms` method in the `Basic` or `Expr` classes.",

The method `atoms` in class `Basic` is crucial, as it specifies that when no types are provided, it defaults to returning instances of `Atom`. The key adjustment required is to modify this method to only consider objects without `.args` as leaf nodes, instead of just subclasses of `Atom`.\n\nInspection of the search results reveals several key spans of relevance:\n\n- `sympy/core/basic.py`:\n  - Span `Basic.atoms`: This span contains the `atoms` method definition which is the core of the issue. The method currently defaults to returning instances of `Atom`.\n  - Span `Basic.free_symbols`: This method may be indirectly related to the modification needs as it iterates over `.args`.\n\n- `sympy/core/expr.py`:\n  - Span `AtomicExpr`: This class inherits from both `Atom` and `Expr`. It has methods related to evaluation of derivatives and polynomial recognition, which could have implications if the definition of leaf nodes is altered.\n\nEach identification is based on its relevance to changing the specification of leaf nodes to those without `.args` and possible effects on related methods.\n\nTo accurately address the issue, a modification would need to adjust the `atoms` method within `Basic` to use the presence of `.args` as the criterion for constituting a non-leaf node, potentially leading to changes in other methods like `free_symbols` and `_sorted_args` if they do not adequately check for the presence of `.args` when identifying leaf nodes.",
