The primary relevance in the `sympy/core/basic.py` file's `Basic` class is the `atoms()` method itself. This method directly relates to the issue as it is defined to return elements of type `Atom` when no types are specified. This method should be adjusted to check that the objects have no `.args` rather than just being instances of `Atom`. Furthermore, the `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` also has an `atoms()` method that might need similar adjustment. Lastly, in `sympy/matrices/common.py`, the `MatrixProperties` class also contains an `atoms()` method which should be reviewed to ensure consistency and adherence to the correct definition of a leaf node.",

This should be fixed by considering an object with no `.args` as a leaf node. I need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the `atoms()` method and ensure the leaf node checks are correct. First, I reviewed the `sympy/core/basic.py` file context provided, where the `Basic.atoms()` method is defined. It already checks for instances of the types provided, with a default check for `Atom`. Next, I analyzed the new search results, focusing on the `sympy/core/expr.py` file, which contains the definition of `Expr`, as well as the `sympy/core/basic.py` file, which has additional context for `Basic.atoms()`. No new information was found in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` and `sympy/matrices/common.py` concerning the `atoms()` method issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans should be from `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`, specifically focusing on the `atoms()` method definitions and any related code that checks for leaf nodes.",
