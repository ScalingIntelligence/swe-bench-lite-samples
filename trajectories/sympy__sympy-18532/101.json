This implies identifying code that relates to the `atoms` method and the class hierarchy involving `Atom` and `Expr`. From the search results, the `sympy/core/expr.py` file contains several relevant spans, including the `Expr` class definition, method definitions within `Expr`, and the `AtomicExpr` class. In `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `Basic` class contains the definition of the `atoms` method. It's important to ensure that the `atoms` method correctly identifies instances of `Atom` based on the criterion of having no `.args`. The current implementation of `atoms` in the `Basic` class applies a filter based on type, which is a good starting point but may need adjustment to filter based on the `.args` attribute. The relevant spans include the `atoms` method in `Basic`, the `Expr` class in `expr.py`, and subclasses of `Atom` such as `AtomicExpr`. These sections are critical for addressing the issue by identifying where modifications are needed to ensure `atoms` properly distinguishes between objects based on the presence of `.args`.",
