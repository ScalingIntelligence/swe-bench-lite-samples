The current implementation of `Basic.atoms` in `sympy/core/basic.py` specifies that if no types are provided, it defaults to `Atom`. This directly addresses the part of the issue related to returning subclasses of `Atom`. The method needs to be modified to check for the presence of `.args` rather than relying on class types. The definition of `Basic` class indicates that every instance has an `_args` attribute, which means we need to modify the `atoms` method to include a check for the presence of `args` when deciding if a node is a leaf.\n\nThe immediate relevance of the `Basic` class and the `Basic.atoms` method is clear from the issue description and the code provided. The `Basic` class defines the `atoms` method, which is likely part of a hierarchy that includes subclasses like `Atom`. The task is to ensure that the `atoms` method evaluates nodes based on whether they have `.args` and not based on their class, which implies an update to the method.\n\nThe identified code span 'Basic.atoms' in `sympy/core/basic.py` is directly related to the issue because it outlines how the `atoms` method on instances of `Basic` is currently implemented and how it should change. Specifically, we need to identify leaf nodes using the presence of the `_args` attribute rather than the inheritance from `Atom`.",
