The current implementation in `Basic` class, specified by the `Basic.atoms` span, checks for instances of `types` which defaults to `(Atom,)` if no types are provided. This default behavior is likely the cause of the observed behavior. Additionally, the `Permutation` class in `permutations.py` and `MatrixProperties` class in `common.py` also have their own `atoms` methods, which might need to be reviewed or adjusted for consistency with the proposed change. Since the issue directly relates to the `atoms` method within the `Basic` class and potentially elsewhere, these other instances should be considered for potential impact and synchronization with the new definition of a leaf node. The initial focus should be on modifying the `Basic.atoms` method to check for objects without `.args` rather than just subclasses of `Atom`.",
