In the provided search results, the `atoms` method implementations in `Basic`, `Permutation`, and `MatrixProperties` classes are potential candidates. The `Basic` class defines the `atoms` method with a default type of `Atom`, which is not aligned with the requirement that leaf nodes should have no `.args`. The `Permutation` class and `MatrixProperties` class also have `atoms` methods that should be checked for relevance but since they either directly use their own structure (array_form) or call `_eval_atoms` respectively, their specific implementations might not directly address the issue but are contextually linked and thus should be noted for possible deeper investigation later.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, focusing on the `Basic` class's `atoms` method would initially be most crucial.
