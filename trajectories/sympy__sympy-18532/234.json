The correct definition should return objects that have no `.args`. The file context provided indicates that `sympy/core/basic.py` contains the `Basic` class with an `atoms` method and `Atom` class, while `sympy/core/expr.py` contains the `Expr` class that likely inherits this method. The `experimental_lambdify.py` also contains a `sympy_atoms_namespace` method that might be relevant in understanding how `atoms` is used. Therefore, focusing on these specific files and classes is crucial to pinpoint the exact locations of the code to modify or investigate.",

The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` is not aligned with this because it returns subclasses of `Atom` directly. To fix this, the definition of a leaf node should be changed to check that it has no `.args` rather than being an instance of `Atom`. This change needs to be verified not to affect performance. The relevant code span to focus on is `Basic.atoms` in `sympy/core/basic.py`, which performs the atom search. The issue suggests modifying this code to implement the correct behavior. The other file, `experimental_lambdify.py`, contains a static method `Lambdifier.sympy_atoms_namespace`, which uses `expr.atoms(Symbol, NumberSymbol, I, zoo, oo)` but does not directly address the core issue at hand, which is the behavior of `expr.atoms()` itself. Therefore, it is less relevant to the current task of modifying the `atoms` method to adhere to the new leaf node definition.",

The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` sets the default types to `(Atom,)` if no types are provided. To address the issue, we need to identify code spans that handle the definition and implementation of `atoms` method and any related classes or methods that might affect the performance or functionality. The search results provide context in `sympy/core/expr.py` and `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, specifically showing the `Expr` class with methods like `is_polynomial`, `is_rational_function`, and `is_algebraic_expr` that might be affected by changes in the definition of a 'leaf' node in the hierarchy. Also, the `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` has its own `atoms` method, which might need to be adjusted to fit the new definition. Additionally, the `AtomicExpr` class definition in `sympy/core/expr.py` shows that it inherits from both `Atom` and `Expr`, which is relevant as it directly relates to the expected behavior of `atoms` method.",

Currently, the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class is checking for instances of `Atom` directly. The issue suggests that this should be corrected to check if an expression has no `.args` instead of being a subclass of `Atom`. This change needs to be carefully implemented to ensure it doesn't negatively impact performance. Relevant code spans are identified in `sympy/core/basic.py` where the `atoms` method is defined and where the `Atom` class is defined. Additionally, other files like `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` also implement an `atoms` method, which should be reviewed for consistency. Other files such as `sympy/matrices/common.py` also contain references to `atoms`, suggesting a broader pattern to check in the codebase. Given the nature of the issue, it's important to ensure that all classes with an `atoms` method are aligned with the proposed change.",

But the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`. \n\nThis should be easy to fix, but one needs to check that this doesn't affect the performance. \n\n"
