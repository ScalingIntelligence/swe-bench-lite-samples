This suggests a need to redefine what constitutes a leaf node in the expression tree. To identify relevant code spans, I focused on the usage and definition of `.atoms()` and how it relates to `Atom`. The search results show implementations of `.atoms()` in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/matrices/common.py`, as well as a direct inheritance of `Atom` in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. The current implementation of `.atoms()` in `Basic` class in `basic.py` uses `Atom` as the default type if no types are specified, which aligns with the issue description. However, the issue recommends changing this to consider nodes with no `.args` as leaf nodes. This analysis points to the `Basic` class and its `.atoms()` method as the most relevant code spans to address the reported issue.",
