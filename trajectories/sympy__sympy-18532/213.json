The context provided shows that the `atoms` method is defined in the `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py`. Also, `Atom` is a subclass of `Basic` and there's a method `_atomic` defined in the same file. The `_atomic` function might be relevant as it sounds like it could relate to what `expr.atoms()` should be doing. Additionally, since `Expr` extends `Basic`, it's likely that the `atoms` method is intended to work with `Expr` instances. Therefore, it's important to check both `Basic` and `Expr` classes along with any associated methods like `_atomic`. Furthermore, to ensure performance is not affected, it's crucial to look into how these methods are used elsewhere in the codebase, especially in files like `sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py` where the `sympy_atoms_namespace` might use `atoms`.",

Currently, the method `atoms` in the `Basic` class of the file `sympy/core/basic.py` returns subclasses of `Atom`. The definition of a leaf node should be based on the absence of `.args`. This discrepancy is directly related to the issue. Furthermore, the `sympy_atoms_namespace` method in `Lambdifier` class from `sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py` uses `expr.atoms`, suggesting that changes in `Basic.atoms` could potentially affect this part of the codebase as well. Given the nature of the issue, it is crucial to ensure that modifying `Basic.atoms` does not adversely impact the performance or functionality of other dependent methods like `sympy_atoms_namespace`. Additionally, reviewing how `expr.atoms` is utilized across other parts of the codebase might also be necessary to ensure comprehensive understanding and potential areas affected by changes.",

The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` uses `(Atom,)` as the default type if no types are provided. However, the issue states that the definition of a leaf node should be based on the absence of `.args` rather than being a subclass of `Atom`. This requires a change in the `atoms` method's implementation. Given the current search results, the relevant files identified are `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. The `Basic.atoms` method directly relates to the issue and needs to be adjusted. Additionally, the `AtomicExpr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py` is related as it inherits from `Atom` and `Expr`, indicating how atoms are defined within expressions. The `Lambdifier.sympy_atoms_namespace` method in `sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py` is also relevant because it uses the `expr.atoms` method, implying potential context where the `atoms` method's behavior is explicitly used or tested.",
