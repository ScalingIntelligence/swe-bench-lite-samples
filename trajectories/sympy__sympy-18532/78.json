The correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`. It seems likely that the `atoms` method is defined in a class that is a subclass of `Basic` or `Expr`, and we should specifically look for implementations or calls to this method. Given the provided context, `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` seem especially relevant due to the presence of `Basic` and `Expr` classes, and the `atoms` method in `Basic`. Furthermore, since the issue involves understanding and possibly modifying the behavior of `atoms` regarding how it handles subclasses of `Atom`, we need to look into functions or methods that might deal with atom manipulation or classification.",

The current implementation in 'Basic.atoms' method checks for subclasses of 'Atom' if no types are provided, which is the source of the issue. Therefore, I searched for all occurrences where 'atoms' method or related classes are defined, leading me to the 'Basic' class in the provided search results. The 'Basic.atoms' method is implemented in a way that aligns directly with the issue described, as it checks for instances of 'Atom' without considering the presence of '.args'.
