The key aspect here is understanding the distinction between an `Atom` and an object with no `.args`.\n\nIn the provided search results, the `Basic` class definition contains the `_args` attribute, which is crucial for determining whether an object is a leaf node (i.e., has no `.args`). The `Basic.atoms` method currently returns objects if they are instances of the specified types, which defaults to `(Atom,)` if no types are provided. This method needs to be adjusted to check if objects have no `.args` rather than just being instances of `Atom`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue are the class definition of `Basic` and the `Basic.atoms` method. These spans provide the context needed to understand where the changes should be made to fix the issue as described.",

Since the `atoms` method is directly related to the reported issue and the `Basic` class where `.args` are managed is also present, it seems that the provided file context is highly relevant to addressing the issue.
