The current implementation returns subclasses of `Atom`, but the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`. This requires checking and modifying the `atoms` method in the relevant classes, primarily `Basic` and possibly `Expr`, as indicated by the provided context. Performance considerations should also be addressed to ensure that the changes do not negatively impact the system.",

The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` uses `Atom` as a criterion for leaf nodes, but we need to change this to check for the absence of `.args`. The relevant code spans to consider are:\n\n1. The `atoms` method in `Basic` class where the types are checked and `Atom` is currently used as the default for no arguments.\n2. The `Atom` class itself, which is currently used as the basis for determining leaf nodes.\n\nBy analyzing the provided code spans, it is clear that the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class is directly related to the issue. This method currently defaults to using `Atom` if no types are provided. To fix the issue, we need to modify this method to check for the absence of `.args` instead. The additional methods in the `Basic` class are not directly relevant to the change required for the `atoms` method, though they provide context on how other functionalities might interact with atoms. The `Atom` class definitions also provide insights into how atoms are currently defined but do not require changes.\n\nIn the second file, `sympy/core/expr.py`, while there is code related to expressions and their handling, none of the code spans directly indicate modifications needed for the `atoms` method as described in the issue. Therefore, focusing on the `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py` should suffice to address the issue.\n\nThe task involves updating the `Basic.atoms` method to correctly identify leaf nodes based on the absence of `.args` rather than relying on the `Atom` class.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue is about changing the behavior of `expr.atoms()` to return objects with no `.args` instead of subclasses of `Atom`. The current implementation of `atoms()` in the `Basic` class does not align with this requirement as it currently uses `isinstance(expr, types)` to check for types. To fix this, we need to modify the `atoms()` method to check if the expression has no arguments, i.e., `expr.args` is empty. The current context shows the `Basic` class and its `atoms()` method. The search results provided include various methods within the `Basic` class, but none that specifically address the issue of checking for expressions with no arguments. Therefore, the task is not complete as we still need to identify or modify the `atoms()` method to match the new definition of a leaf node.",
