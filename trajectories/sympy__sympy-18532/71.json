The relevant classes and methods to look for are `Basic`, `Expr`, `Basic.atoms()`, and possibly `Atom`. Since this involves changing the behavior of the `atoms()` method, we should primarily focus on files containing these classes. To ensure we are not missing critical parts, we should also include any files that might invoke or make use of these classes or methods. Given the provided files, it seems the focus should be on `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`, which contain the `Basic`, `AtomicExpr`, and `Expr` classes.",

This indicates that the current implementation in `Basic.atoms` needs to be adjusted to consider only objects with no `.args` as leaf nodes. The provided search results contain relevant code spans in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. It's evident from the `Basic.atoms` method that it currently checks for instances of the provided types, which default to `(Atom,)` if no types are specified. Additionally, there are definitions for `Atom` and `Basic` classes which are central to understanding the structure and methods involved. The `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` also defines its own `atoms` method, which may need similar adjustments if it's intended to conform to the same standard. The `MatrixProperties.atoms` method in `sympy/matrices/common.py` is also noteworthy as it directly relates to how atoms are identified in matrix contexts. Both these additional methods provide a more comprehensive view of where and how the method `atoms` is used within different contexts across the codebase, which could impact how a fix for the issue in `Basic.atoms` is applied. Given this understanding, it's clear that the `Basic.atoms` definition in `sympy/core/basic.py` should be modified to correctly identify atoms based on the criteria of having no `.args`, and ultimately this fix should also consider similar methods across different modules to maintain consistency.",

The 'Permutation' class in 'sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py' inherits from 'Atom' and implements its own 'atoms()' method, indicating that changes might be needed here as well. Although the 'MatrixProperties' class in 'sympy/matrices/common.py' also involves 'atoms()', it primarily uses 'Atom' as a type check, which doesn't directly conflict with the issue but could be indirectly affected.
