Currently, `expr.atoms()` with no arguments returns subclasses of `Atom`. The solution involves ensuring that only objects with no `.args` are returned as leaf nodes. The `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py` is a foundational class in SymPy and contains the `atoms` method. This method currently checks for instances of `types` which, if not provided, defaults to `(Atom,)`. This is the primary location to implement the fix, by altering the condition to check for objects with no `.args` rather than just instances of `Atom`. The other files containing `atoms` methods do not seem directly related to the reported issue, as they do not involve the same definition of `atoms` which is the focus of the fix needed.",
