The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` uses `types = (Atom,)` when no arguments are provided, which results in subclasses of `Atom` being returned. To address this, the implementation needs to be changed to check for objects with no `.args` instead. The search results show that `Basic.atoms` defines the method to collect instances of `Atom` or its subclasses by default. Additionally, there are `Permutation.atoms` and `MatrixProperties.atoms` methods defined in other files. The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` should be modified to check for objects with no `.args` and not just subclasses of `Atom`. This change should be made in `Basic.atoms` to ensure the functionality is updated as expected. The other methods (`Permutation.atoms` and `MatrixProperties.atoms`) do not seem to be directly affected by this issue as they have their own specific implementations. Therefore, only `Basic.atoms` in `sympy/core/basic.py` needs to be updated.",
