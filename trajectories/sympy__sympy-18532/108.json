Focusing on these files will be crucial to fixing this issue, especially given that the `atoms` method is directly relevant to the problem.

By examining the provided code spans, I can see that the `Basic` class includes an `_args` attribute which is relevant for determining if a node is a leaf node or not (i.e., having no `.args`). The `Basic.atoms` function currently returns instances of `Atom` which can potentially include subclasses of `Atom`. This aligns with the issue, as the correct definition of a leaf node should be based on the absence of `.args` rather than being a subclass of `Atom`. Additionally, the `Atom` class, which is a subclass of `Basic`, confirms that `Atom` instances have no `.args`, and also, the `Basic` class includes many attributes like `is_number`, `is_Atom`, etc., which also have to be reviewed if they interact with the `.atoms()` function. Given this detailed analysis, there might need modification within or around the `.atoms()` function to ensure it returns objects based on `.args` criteria, thus aligning with the current issue. Thus, I've identified two spans ('Basic.atoms' and 'Atom') as relevant to the reported issue.",
