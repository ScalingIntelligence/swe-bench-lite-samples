The relevant portion of the code is located in the `Basic` class within the `sympy/core/basic.py` file. Specifically, the `atoms` method within this class currently checks if an expression is an instance of the specified types, which by default includes `Atom`. The problem arises because the method does not correctly identify if an object is a leaf node (i.e., it has no `.args`). To address this issue, the method should be modified to check if an object has `.args` and if it does not, then it should be considered a leaf node. This modification will ensure that `expr.atoms()` returns the correct set of leaf nodes as per the requirement. Based on this analysis, the relevant code span is the `atoms` method definition within the `Basic` class.",

Specifically, it points out that `atoms()` should return objects with no `.args` instead of subclasses of `Atom`. This discrepancy suggests a need to refine the criteria used by `atoms()` to identify leaf nodes or atoms in the expression tree. The provided file context already highlights the `Basic.atoms` method, but the search results extend our view to other relevant portions of the `Basic` class, such as the `__new__` method that initializes `_args`, and several other methods that involve handling of `args`, such as `_has`, `replace`, and `simplify`. These additional methods are crucial for understanding how `args` are managed within the class, which directly impacts how we might modify `atoms()` to align with the reported issue. Taking all these into account, I will mark `Basic.atoms` and any other relevant spans, like those dealing with `args` initialization and processing, as relevant.",
