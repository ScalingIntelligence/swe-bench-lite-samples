Since the `atoms` method is described in the context of `Basic` and `Expr` classes, these should be the main focus for the search. Additionally, due to the potential impact on performance, it would be prudent to specifically locate the `atoms` method definition to ensure that modifications to this method do not inadvertently affect other functionalities or performance benchmarks.",
