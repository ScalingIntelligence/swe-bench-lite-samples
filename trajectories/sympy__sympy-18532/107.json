Additionally, the `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` is a subclass of `Atom` and has its own `atoms()` method, which might need adjustment based on the fix applied to `Basic`. Lastly, the `MatrixProperties` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py` also has an `atoms()` method, but it directly calls `_eval_atoms()` and doesn't appear to be particularly relevant to the issue unless subclasses of `Atom` are also involved here.",

But the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`. \n\nThis should be easy to fix, but one needs to check that this doesn't affect the performance. \n\n"
