The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` uses `(Atom,)` as the default type if no types are provided, which aligns with the current behavior of returning subclasses of `Atom`. To address the issue, the `Basic.atoms` function should be modified to check if an expression has no `.args` rather than checking if it is an instance of `Atom`. The presence of the `_args` attribute in the `Basic` class definition indicates that it is possible to determine whether an expression has `.args` or not, which is crucial for implementing the new behavior as requested. Thus, the relevant code spans are those defining the `Basic.atoms` method and the `Basic` class itself, as they will need to be adjusted to reflect the new definition of a leaf node.",
