Analyzing the provided code, we find the `Basic` class with the method `atoms()` which currently checks if an expression is an instance of certain types, including `Atom`. This method would benefit from being modified to check for the condition of no `.args`. Additionally, the `Basic` class already contains the attribute `_args`, which can be used to verify the condition. In the `Expr` class, the property `expr_free_symbols` shows how `.args` is iterated over, which could potentially be adapted to perform the check for the absence of `args`. Furthermore, the `AtomicExpr` class, which inherits from `Atom` and `Expr`, has its own `expr_free_symbols` property that returns itself if it has no arguments, which aligns with the issue's requirement to define leaf nodes as those with no `.args`. Based on this analysis, it appears that both the `atoms()` method in the `Basic` class and the related logic in the `Expr` and `AtomicExpr` classes are relevant to the issue.",

The file context includes the `Basic` class and its `atoms()` method, providing relevant context for understanding and potentially implementing the fix. Additionally, the subclasses and their methods in the file context, such as `AtomicExpr`, are relevant as they deal directly with atomic elements, indicative of the leaf nodes described in the issue.

The current implementation in the `Basic` class returns all instances of `Atom` in the expression tree, but the issue suggests that we should check whether a node has no `.args` to determine if it's a leaf node. This would involve modifying the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class. The search results contain relevant code spans in `sympy/core/basic.py`, particularly the `atoms` method and the definition of the `Basic` class. Additionally, the context provides the `Atom` class definition and the `Basic.atoms` method. The `atoms` method currently checks if an expression is an instance of `Atom`, but it needs to be adjusted to check if the expression has no `.args`. This adjustment should be made to `Basic.atoms` by replacing the condition `if isinstance(expr, types)` with something like `if isinstance(expr, types) and not expr.args`.
