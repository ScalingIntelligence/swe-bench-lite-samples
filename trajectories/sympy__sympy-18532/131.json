The issue specifically points out that `expr.atoms()` should return objects that have no `.args`, rather than just subclasses of `Atom`. This indicates a need to modify the `atoms` method to adhere to this new definition of a leaf node. The provided search results include the `Basic` class definition and the `atoms` method within it. The `Basic` class definition includes the `_args` attribute, which is crucial for determining whether an object has no arguments. The `atoms` method currently uses `preorder_traversal` to traverse the expressions and checks if the expression is an instance of the specified types. It defaults to `Atom` if no types are provided. This setup aligns with the issue's requirement for modification, making the `Basic` class and its `atoms` method highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
