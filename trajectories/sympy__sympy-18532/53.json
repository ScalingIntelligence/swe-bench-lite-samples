The correct definition of a leaf node should be based on the absence of `.args` rather than the class type being a subclass of `Atom`. Upon reviewing the search results, it is evident that the relevant code spans are located within the `Basic` class definition and the `Basic.atoms` method. The `__slots__` attribute in the `Basic` class definition includes `_args`, which is relevant to the issue since it dictates whether an object is a leaf node based on having no arguments. The `Basic.atoms` method currently filters atoms based on the type being a subclass of `Atom` when no types are specified, which is contrary to the desired functionality. These sections of code are directly related to the issue at hand, making them the appropriate spans to focus on for resolving the issue.",

To fix this, we should change the condition to check whether an expression has `.args` (i.e., it is a leaf node). This change requires careful consideration to avoid performance issues.
