The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` has a default type of `Atom` if no types are provided, which is not aligned with the reported issue. Additionally, the `Permutation.atoms` method does not use `.args` and should adhere to the correct definition. However, the `Expr` class, which is a subclass of `Basic`, does not have its own `atoms` method, and we must check if its behavior aligns with the issue indirectly through its inheritance. Thus, the relevant code spans to address the issue are in `Basic.atoms` and `Permutation.atoms`. No changes in `Expr` are directly visible within the provided spans, but its behavior through inheritance should be verified after fixing `Basic.atoms`.",

Specifically, a leaf node should be defined as having no `.args`. This is currently implemented in a way that doesn't match this definition. The analysis should focus on identifying the relevant code sections that handle the `atoms` method in `Basic` and any subclasses that might override this behavior, particularly checking how leaf nodes are determined and ensuring that the definition of a leaf node is based on the presence of `.args` and not just being a subclass of `Atom`. Additionally, we need to ensure that new or existing code doesn't inadvertently affect performance. \n\nFrom the search results and file context provided, the `atoms` method in `Basic` class and its potential overrides in subclasses like `Permutation` and `MatrixProperties` are relevant. `Basic.atoms` currently defaults to returning subclasses of `Atom`, which does not align with the desired behavior. The `Permutation` class correctly defines `atoms` based on the content of `array_form`, which is a specialized implementation but seems to be in line with the issue's requirements if we consider `array_form` as analogous to `args`. The `MatrixProperties` class also implements `atoms` but lacks a specific implementation detail in the provided context, so further investigation may be necessary. \n\nBased on the reported issue and the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are those dealing directly with the `atoms` method, including both the default implementation in `Basic` and any overrides in subclasses.",

The correct behavior should be to return objects with no `.args`, which indicates they are leaf nodes in the expression tree. The current implementation of `Basic.atoms()` in `sympy/core/basic.py` sets `types = (Atom,)` when no arguments are provided, which leads to the inclusion of all subclasses. This needs to be adjusted to check for objects without `.args`. Similar methods in other classes, like `Permutation` and `MatrixProperties`, also need review. The potential fix requires ensuring that `Basic.atoms()` and similar methods only return objects that are true leaf nodes, not just instances of `Atom`, to maintain expected performance. Note that other methods like `Basic.copy()`, `Basic.free_symbols`, and `Basic.expr_free_symbols` are not directly related to the issue but may be relevant for broader understanding or future modifications related to similar functionality.",
