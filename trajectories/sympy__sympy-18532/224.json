By reading the provided code in `sympy/core/basic.py`, I found the `Basic` class definition and the `Basic.atoms` method, which are key components mentioned in the reported issue. The `Basic` class defines `_args`, which is relevant for identifying whether a node is a leaf node or not. The `Basic.atoms` method currently filters by subclasses of `Atom`, and this logic should be altered as per the issue's request.

This method needs to be modified to instead check if `expr.args` is empty, which would indicate a leaf node. The search results include multiple file contexts with various methods and definitions. Notably, `sympy/core/expr.py` contains the `Expr` class with multiple methods, but no direct `atoms` method.

However, to address the issue as per the requirement, we need to ensure that `atoms()` checks for objects with no `.args` instead of just subclasses of `Atom`. Since we didn't find the method in `Expr`, we should now examine the `Basic` class directly for potential modifications.",

This method currently returns objects of type `Atom` but doesn't check for the presence of `.args`, which is the key change required by the issue. The `sympy/core/expr.py` file contains definitions related to classes like `Expr` and `AtomicExpr` but doesn't directly address the issue with `atoms()`.
