The search results contain the definition of the `Basic` class and its `atoms` method. The `atoms` method currently checks if an expression is an instance of the types provided (which defaults to `Atom` if no types are given). The issue suggests that instead of checking for instances of `Atom`, the method should check for expressions that have no `.args`. This is relevant because the `Basic` class has an `_args` attribute, and the `atoms` method should be modified to consider expressions with no `.args`. Therefore, the identified span 'Basic.atoms' is relevant to address the reported issue as it directly concerns the method that needs modification.
