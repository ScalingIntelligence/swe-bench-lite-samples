The `Basic` class includes `_args` as one of its slots, indicating that this is where the arguments for the class are stored. The `atoms` method currently checks if `expr` is an instance of the `types` provided (which defaults to `(Atom,)` if no types are specified). The `atoms` method does not directly check for objects with no `.args`. Instead, it relies on the type check. To resolve the issue, the `atoms` method would need to be modified to check if the `expr` has no `.args` before adding it to the result set.",
