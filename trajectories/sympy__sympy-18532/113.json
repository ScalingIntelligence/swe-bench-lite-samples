The correct definition of a leaf node should be based on whether it has no `.args`. To address this, we need to modify the `atoms` method to check for the absence of `.args` instead of just being an instance of `Atom`. The relevant code spans can be found in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, where the `atoms` method is defined. The modification can be made in the `atoms` method of the `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py`, and a similar check might be needed in the `atoms` method of the `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. The `atoms` method in `sympy/matrices/common.py` might also need to be adjusted, though the current implementation does not directly address the issue as it uses the default behavior of treating `Atom` as a leaf node.\n\nSteps to fix the issue include:\n1. Modify the `atoms` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` to check for the absence of `.args` before adding an expression to the result set.\n2. Verify if similar changes are needed in the `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`.\n3. Ensure that modifications do not negatively impact performance through thorough testing and validation.\n\nRelevant code spans include those defining the `atoms` methods in the `Basic` and `Permutation` classes.",
