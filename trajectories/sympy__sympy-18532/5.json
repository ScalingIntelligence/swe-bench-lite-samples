The search results reveal that in the `Basic` class, `atom()` method indeed checks types against `(Atom,)` if no types are provided. This confirms the bug as described. To fix this, the method should instead check if an object has no `.args` to determine if it's a leaf node. The suggested change aligns with the definition that a leaf node lacks `.args`, as annotated in the class `Basic` with the `__slots__`. The relevance of the presented code snippet from `sympy/core/basic.py` lies in the two spans: 'Basic', which introduces the class attributes like `_args`, among others, and 'Basic.atoms' that explicitly defines the problematic `atoms()` method. Both are necessary because any fix on `atoms()` should consider the overall object and attribute definition within the `Basic` class to avoid potential performance or other semantic impacts.",

This context is directly relevant to the issue, as it involves the `atoms()` method and its relationship to the `Atom` class. The current implementation of `atoms()` specifically looks for instances of `Atom` and returns them. To address the issue, it would be necessary to modify the `atoms()` method to check for objects with no `.args` instead of just subclasses of `Atom`. However, without further context on how objects are instantiated and their `.args` are managed, it is not clear if this modification would capture all relevant cases.

The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` uses `isinstance(expr, types)` where `types` defaults to `(Atom,)`. To address the issue, we need to modify the condition to check for objects with no `.args` property. The search results provide additional methods in the `Basic` class that involve `_args` and may be relevant for understanding the broader context or potential side effects. Specifically, the methods `__new__`, `__reduce_ex__`, `__getnewargs__`, `__getstate__`, `__setstate__`, `__hash__`, `_hashable_content`, `fromiter`, `class_key`, `rcall`, `_recursive_call`, `subs`, `_subs`, `_eval_subs`, `_has`, `replace`, `simplify`, `_eval_rewrite`, `_accept_eval_derivative`, `_visit_eval_derivative_scalar`, `_visit_eval_derivative_array`, and `_exec_constructor_postprocessors` could be relevant for ensuring the change does not inadvertently affect other functionalities.
