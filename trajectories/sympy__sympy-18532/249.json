This implies a need to re-evaluate the condition within the `atoms` method to ensure it correctly identifies leaf nodes (objects with no `.args`). Currently, the `atoms` method checks if an expression is an instance of the specified types, but it doesn't explicitly check for nodes with no `.args`. This is a clear mismatch with the requirement. To address this, the relevant part of the code is within the `Basic` class, specifically the `atoms` method. This method is where the logic for identifying 'atoms' should be adjusted to include a check for `.args`. The provided code shows the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class, which iterates through expressions and adds them to the result set if they match the specified types. Directly relevant to the issue is the `Basic.atoms` span and potentially the `Basic.free_symbols` span for context on how `args` are handled. Additional relevance is given to the `Atom` class definition, which gives context on what an `Atom` is but doesn't need direct modification for this issue. The `Expr` class spans are more extensive but don't directly address the issue at hand - they deal with expression manipulations and types typical in SymPy but don't directly impact the current fix needed in the `atoms` method. Given the issue's focus, the search should consider updating the `Basic.atoms` method to add a check for `expr.args` being empty; however, further testing and review would be needed to ensure no performance regressions are introduced.",

This is incorrect based on the issue description.\n\nConsidering the new `search_results`, the `Basic` class and its `atoms` method are presented again. However, there is no additional code that can directly address the issue other than what is already in the `file_context`. Therefore, the analysis of the `search_results` does not present a reason to deviate from focusing on the `atoms` method of the `Basic` class.\n\nTo address the issue, the `atoms` method needs to be modified to check for the presence of `.args` in addition to or instead of checking for the `Atom` type.
