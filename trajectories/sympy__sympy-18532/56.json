This implies that the current behavior of `expr.atoms()` needs to be changed to only return leaf nodes, which are defined as having no `.args`. The search results provided contain the implementation of the `Basic` class and the `atoms` method within `sympy/core/basic.py`. The `Basic` class has an `_args` attribute, which aligns with the definition of a leaf node in the context of the issue. The `atoms` method currently checks if an expression is an instance of the specified types, which are defined as `(Atom,)` when no types are provided. This behavior needs to be modified to check if an expression has `.args` (which would determine if it is a leaf node) rather than just being a subclass of `Atom`. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly involve the code segments that need to be modified to address the issue.",
