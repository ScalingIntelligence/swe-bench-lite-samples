This suggests that the modification should be made in the `atoms` method within the `Basic` class or its subclasses. Given the provided file context, it's clear that the function needs to be revised to check for objects that don't have `.args` instead of just being subclasses of `Atom`. Performance implications should also be considered. The relevant files seem to be sympy/core/basic.py and sympy/core/expr.py, and possibly others where similar logic might be used. The search should focus on the `atoms` method and its implementations.",

To address this, we need to modify the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class to check if an expression has no `.args` rather than just being an instance of `Atom`. The relevant code spans are found in the `sympy/core/basic.py` file, particularly the `atoms` method which currently checks for instances of `Atom`. Additionally, understanding the context of `Atom` class and `Basic` class helps in making the necessary changes to address the issue. The `Atom` class is a subclass of `Basic` and represents atomic expressions with no arguments. The `Basic` class has the `atoms` method that we need to modify, and it also contains the `_args` attribute which needs to be checked for the absence of arguments in expressions. The `Expr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py` also confirms the presence of the `_args` attribute, which is crucial for this modification.",

This can be addressed by modifying the `Basic.atoms` method to check for the presence of `.args` rather than relying on the `isinstance(expr, types)` check. The existing `Basic.atoms` method and related classes in the search results are relevant for this modification. Specifically, the `Basic.atoms` method and the definition of `Atom` in `sympy/core/basic.py` are directly related to the issue. Additionally, the definition of `Expr` in `sympy/core/expr.py` is relevant as it inherits from `Basic` and would be affected by any changes to `atoms`. The `Permutation.atoms` method in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` and `MatrixProperties.atoms` in `sympy/matrices/common.py` are not directly relevant to the issue, as they do not pertain to the definition of atoms in the context described in the issue. Therefore, the focus should be on the `Basic.atoms` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` and ensuring that the modification considers the performance impact as mentioned in the issue.",

This means that the definition of a leaf node based on the absence of `.args` needs to be implemented. The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` uses the presence of `Atom` subclasses to identify leaf nodes, which is incorrect according to the issue description.\n\nReviewing the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are:\n\n1. `sympy/core/basic.py` - `Basic.atoms`: This method currently uses `Atom` subclasses to identify leaf nodes. The method needs to be adjusted to consider objects with no `.args` as leaf nodes.\n\n2. `sympy/core/basic.py` - `Atom` class: While the class itself is not directly the focus, understanding its role in identifying leaf nodes helps in interpreting the change needed in the `Basic.atoms` method.\n\n3. `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` - `Permutation.atoms`: This class methods could be relevant in understanding the broader implementation of `atoms` across classes. Although, at this stage, it's not clear how this aligns with the issue for `expr.atoms()`, it provides context into potential variations and usage.\n\nFrom the provided search results and the current context, the core adjustment needed is in the `Basic.atoms` method's logic. Instead of checking for `isinstance(expr, types)`, the logic should check for `not expr.args` along with `isinstance(expr, types)` to correctly identify leaf nodes as ones with no `.args`.\n\nThe identified spans are sufficient to address the issue. No further search is required, as the correction to the `Basic.atoms` method is the central part of the solution.",
