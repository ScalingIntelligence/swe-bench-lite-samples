The current implementation of `expr.atoms()` directly checks for subclasses of `Atom`, which is incorrect according to the issue's clarification that a leaf node should be defined by having no `.args`. \n\nReviewing the search results, the file `sympy/core/basic.py` contains the definition of the `Basic` class where the `atoms` method is defined. This method currently returns objects based on type `Atom`. The method should be modified to check if the object has no `.args` instead. Additionally, the `Atom` class itself is defined in this file, with methods that do not have `.args` attributes. The `Atom._sorted_args` property explicitly raises an AttributeError for Atoms, which supports the issue's requirement.\n\nThe file `sympy/core/expr.py` contains the definition of the `Expr` class, which inherits `Basic`. This file does not have a direct `atoms` method, but it contains important associated properties and methods like `as_independent` and `free_symbols` that could potentially be impacted by the change. \n\nTo address the issue, the modification should primarily be done in `sympy/core/basic.py`. The current relevant code span is 'Basic.atoms'.\n\nConsidering the documentation in `Atom._sorted_args`, it suggests that a check for Atoms might be necessary in the caller code, which implies that additional attention should be given to how this function is implemented.",
