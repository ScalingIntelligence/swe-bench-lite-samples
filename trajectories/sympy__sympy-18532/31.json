This issue involves checking the implementation of the `atoms` method in the relevant classes, potentially in files like `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. A targeted search for the `atoms` method in these files will help identify where the logic for determining leaf nodes (atoms) needs adjustment.
