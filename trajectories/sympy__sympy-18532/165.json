The correct behavior should be that it returns objects with no `.args`, indicating they are leaf nodes. Analyzing the search results, the code in `sympy/core/basic.py` is particularly relevant because it defines the `Basic` class and its `atoms` method. This method currently returns instances of `Atom` when no types are specified. This directly relates to the issue as it will need to be modified to check for objects without `.args` instead of just instances of `Atom`. The code in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` and `sympy/matrices/common.py` also contain `atoms` methods, but these seem to be specific to `Permutation` and `MatrixProperties` classes respectively and don't relate directly to the issue of `Basic.atoms()` returning subclasses of `Atom`.\n\nTo address the issue, the `Basic.atoms()` method should be modified to check if `self.args` is empty. This will ensure it only returns true leaf nodes. Other classes which inherit from `Basic` will likely need similar updates to maintain consistency across the codebase. However, for now, the focus should be on `Basic.atoms()`. The performance impact will be minimal as it's just an additional check in the `atoms` method of the base class. Other utilities using `atoms` method under the `Basic` class might not get effected unless they specifically need leaf nodes without `.args`.",
