The `Basic` class contains the `_args` attribute, which is crucial for determining if an object is a leaf node (i.e., has no `.args`).

This means the definition of a leaf node should be based on the presence of `.args` rather than the type being a subclass of `Atom`. The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` uses type(Atom) to determine leaf nodes, which needs to be changed. The context provided in `sympy/core/basic.py` shows the `Basic.atoms` method and the `Atom` class definition. The new search results reveal additional context in `sympy/core/expr.py` and further refinements of the `Atom` class in `sympy/core/basic.py`. Specifically, the `Atom` class methods like `matches`, `xreplace`, `doit`, `class_key`, `sort_key`, `_eval_simplify`, and `_sorted_args` provide more insights into the behavior of Atom instances. Additionally, the `AtomicExpr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py` extends `Atom` and `Expr`, suggesting that this class might need adjustments to ensure it correctly represents leaf nodes based on having no `.args` rather than being a subclass of `Atom`. Overall, these findings indicate that the method `Basic.atoms` in `sympy/core/basic.py` and potentially the `AtomicExpr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py` need to be modified to align with the new definition of leaf nodes.",
