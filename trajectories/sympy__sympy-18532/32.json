The current implementation of `Basic.atoms` in `sympy/core/basic.py` is reviewed, focusing on the logic that determines the types to check against and the actual check within the `preorder_traversal`. The method uses a conditional to decide which types to consider based on whether types are provided or not. If no types are provided, it defaults to checking against `Atom`. This default behavior is likely the cause of the issue where subclasses of `Atom` are being returned. A potential solution involves modifying the default behavior or changing the check within the `preorder_traversal` loop to ensure that only objects with no `.args` are considered leaf nodes. The identified span of code is related to the `Basic` class definition and the `Basic.atoms` method, with the method being particularly relevant as it encapsulates the logic for identifying atoms in an expression based on the existing implementation. Therefore, both spans are marked as relevant to address the reported issue.",
