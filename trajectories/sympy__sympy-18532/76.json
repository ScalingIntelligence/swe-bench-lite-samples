Specifically, the method should only return objects with no 'args' instead of potentially returning subclasses of 'Atom'. To address this, we need to locate the implementation of the 'atoms' method and verify if its logic adheres to this requirement. Given the provided file context, the 'atoms' method is likely defined in 'sympy/core/basic.py'. Additionally, since 'atoms' is a method of 'Basic', it's necessary to ensure that the method correctly handles instances with no 'args' in other potentially relevant files such as 'sympy/core/expr.py' where 'Expr' inherits from 'Basic'.",

The input has detailed the relevant files and code spans. The primary focus should be on the `Basic` class from `sympy/core/basic.py`, which has an `atoms` method that currently checks if the expression is an instance of a specified type, which defaults to `Atom` if no types are provided. This method might need to be altered to check if the objects have no `.args` instead of blindly checking if they are an instance of `Atom` to accommodate the ideal logic for identifying a leaf node. Additionally, `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` uses `Atom` without checking `.args`, which could be revised similarly. The `MatrixProperties` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py` has a similar implementation, suggesting a pattern where checking for the presence of `.args` instead of type could be universally applied across these instances.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the `expr.atoms()` function, which currently returns subclasses of `Atom` when called with no arguments. The desired behavior is for `expr.atoms()` to return objects that have no `.args`, which would more accurately represent leaf nodes in the expression tree. \n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, we see implementations of the `atoms()` method in three different files: `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, and `sympy/matrices/common.py`. \n\nIn `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `atoms()` method of the `Basic` class is defined to return elements that are instances of `Atom` if no types are specified. This current behavior aligns with the issue report, indicating a potential area for modification. \n\nIn `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, the `atoms()` method in the `Permutation` class returns elements from `self.array_form`, which is a form of the permutation, suggesting another point of modification if `Permutation` objects need to adhere to the new definition of a leaf node. \n\nLastly, in `sympy/matrices/common.py`, the `atoms()` method in the `MatrixProperties` class delegates the task to `_eval_atoms()`, which, from the given context, might also need inspection to ensure it aligns with the new leaf node definition. \n\nBased on these findings, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue are identified in the `atoms()` methods across the three files.",
