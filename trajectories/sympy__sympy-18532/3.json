The current `Basic.atoms` method has a condition where it returns subclasses of `Atom` if no types are provided. This behavior needs to be changed. The fix involves modifying the `Basic.atoms` method to check if an object has no `.args` before considering it as a leaf node. The `Basic` class is relevant as it defines the `atoms` method and contains the `.args` attribute which is necessary to determine if an object is a leaf node. The `Basic` class currently flags `is_Atom` as `False`, so this logic needs to be inspected and potentially updated. The search results are complete for identifying the relevant code spans as they contain the `Basic` class and the `Basic.atoms` method which directly relates to the issue. However, the performance impact of the change should also be considered. It doesn't appear necessary to search for additional parts of the codebase to address this specific issue since the relevant code is already identified.",
