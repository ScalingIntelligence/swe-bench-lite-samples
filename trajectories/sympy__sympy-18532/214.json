The search results include relevant code spans in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. Specifically, `Basic.atoms` and `Basic` class are directly related to the issue as they define the `atoms` method and the underlying structure for mathematical expressions. The `Expr` class and `AtomicExpr` class also contain related code, which suggests they might need modifications or checks to ensure they meet the new definition of a leaf node.\n\nDuring analysis of the code spans, it was noted that the current implementation of `Basic.atoms` uses `Atom` for checking types if no `types` are provided. This indicates a direct code path related to the reported issue. Additionally, the `Basic` class has attributes that suggest it's at the core of the expression system, meaning changes here could affect performance if not managed carefully.

Specifically, the `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` and the `MatrixProperties` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py` also implement their own versions of the `atoms()` method. These additional implementations need to be considered when fixing the issue related to `expr.atoms()` returning subclasses of `Atom` instead of objects with no `.args`. Understanding how these methods are used and their performance implications across the `sympy` directory is crucial for ensuring a comprehensive solution that doesn't disrupt other functionalities. Therefore, a search for additional usages and implementations of the `atoms()` method across the `sympy` directory is necessary to fully grasp its role and impact.",
