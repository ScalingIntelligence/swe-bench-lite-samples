This suggests a potential issue with how the `atoms` method is defined in the `Basic` class, which could be inherited into other classes. The search results contain three files, but the primary focus is on `sympy/core/basic.py`, which defines the `Basic` class and its `atoms` method. This method currently checks if an expression is an instance of the specified types and adds it to the result set if true. However, based on the issue, it seems the method should be adjusted to check if an expression has no `.args` instead of just being an instance of `Atom` or its subclasses. The other files (`sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` and `sympy/matrices/common.py`) also have classes with an `atoms` method, but they are not directly relevant to the issue since they do not inherit from `Basic` and have their own implementation of `atoms`. Their methods are currently not designed to address the issue of checking for expressions with no `.args`, so they are less relevant. Therefore, the primary focus for fixing this issue should be the `Basic` class's `atoms` method.",
