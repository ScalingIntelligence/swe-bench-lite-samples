We need to identify the relevant code spans that can help fix this issue. The search results provide three files with classes and methods: `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, and `sympy/matrices/common.py`. In `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `Basic` class has an `atoms` method and an `_args` attribute, which are directly relevant to the issue. The `atoms` method in this class checks for `Atom` types and adds them to the result set. This is a key part of the current implementation that needs adjusting.\n\nSimilarly, in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, the `Permutation` class, which is a subclass of `Atom`, also has an `atoms` method. This method returns elements from `self.array_form`, which may also need adjustment. Lastly, in `sympy/matrices/common.py`, the `MatrixProperties` class has an `atoms` method that, if no types are specified, defaults to checking for `Atom`. This behavior likely needs to change to follow the new definition of a leaf node having no `.args`.

Currently, it returns subclasses of `Atom` even though a leaf node should be defined by having no `.args`. After reviewing the current context and search results, key insights include:\n\n1. **File `sympy/core/basic.py`: This file contains the definition of `Basic` class with the `atoms` method. The current implementation checks for instances of given types, defaulting to `(Atom,)`. This directly relates to the issue, as it might not properly filter based on `.args`.\n\n2. **File `sympy/core/expr.py`: While this contains various expressions and their properties, the specific issue about `atoms` lies more deeply within `Basic` and `Atom` interactions rather than `Expr` itself.\n\n3. **File `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`: Here, `Permutation` extends `Atom` and overrides the `atoms` method. This suggests an additional point of evaluation since permutations might nature as atoms without args.\n\n4. **File `sympy/matrices/common.py`: While relevant for matrix operations, the `atoms` method here primarily interacts with atom types which, based on the issue, needs potential modification.\n\nTo address the issue, focus should be on refining the `atoms` method in `Basic` class to specifically check for objects without `.args`, rather than just being instances of `Atom`. This could require adjusting the method to include additional criteria for what constitutes a 'leaf' node beyond type adherence.\n\nThe identified code spans thus directly connect to the namespace and functionalities involved in addressing the reported issue, providing a path for key modifications in the `atoms` method to align with the desired functionality.",

The current implementation in the `Basic` class and other subclasses like `Permutation` and `MatrixProperties` has been reviewed. The analysis of the `Basic.atoms` method reveals that it currently checks if an expression is an instance of `Atom` and adds it to the result set if it matches the specified types. The task is to modify this behavior to ensure that only objects with no `.args` are returned, as this should properly represent leaf nodes in the expression tree. The search results help confirm that `Expr.atoms`, `Permutation.atoms`, and `MatrixProperties.atoms` methods are indeed relevant, reinforcing the need to implement the new leaf node definition in these locations for consistency across subclasses. The `Expr` class spans provided are not directly related to `atoms`, but they demonstrate more expressions and their definitions, ensuring a holistic understanding of basic sympy objects involved in the structure of `Atom` and its usage within the system. With this analysis, a refactor of the `atoms` method across classes could involve a check for the existence of `.args` before considering an object as part of the result set, ensuring the definition of leaf nodes in the context of the law of leaves (empty `.args`). This refactor addresseses the core of the reported issue and assures that the code will adhere more accurately to the definition of a leaf node according to the user's request.",
