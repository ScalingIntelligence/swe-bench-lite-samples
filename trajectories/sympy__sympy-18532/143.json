The current implementation of the `atoms` method checks if the expression is an instance of the specified types, including `Atom`, and adds it to the result set. To address the issue, the `atoms` method should be modified to check if an expression has no `.args` rather than checking if it is an instance of `Atom` or its subclasses.
