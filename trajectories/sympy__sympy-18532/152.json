This problem is likely stemming from the `sympy.core.basic` and `sympy.core.expr` modules, as they are responsible for the `Basic` and `Expr` classes, which include the `atoms` method and the `Atom` subclass. Additional scrutiny is needed to ensure that the fix does not negatively impact performance.

Additionally, we should review the `Atom` class to ensure it correctly defines its behavior concerning `.args`. In the search results, we find more methods related to `Atom` like `matches`, `xreplace`, `doit`, `class_key`, `sort_key`, `_eval_simplify`, and `_sorted_args`.
