The `Atom` class itself is a subclass of `Basic` and is marked with `is_Atom = True`. Additional investigation is needed to find methods in `Basic` or `Expr` that might check for the presence of `.args`, as this attribute appears central to how 'leaf' nodes are identified. The `Expr` class extends `Basic` and includes properties like `expr_free_symbols` that might interact with `args` in some way, but direct checks on `.args` are not immediately visible. Further, understanding how `Atom` is used within the context of these classes could reveal more about the desired behavior for `atoms()`.",

This means that the definition of a leaf node should be revised to check for the presence of `.args` rather than relying on the class type. To address this, we need to focus on the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py`. The current implementation of the `atoms` method uses `isinstance(expr, types)` to filter out atoms which includes subclasses of `Atom`. This should be changed to check for the absence of `.args` instead. The relevant code spans are identified in the `Basic` class, particularly the `atoms` method and the `Basic` class itself for context on how args are managed.
