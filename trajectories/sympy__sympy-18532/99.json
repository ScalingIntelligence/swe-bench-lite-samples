The relevant classes to investigate are `Basic`, `Atom`, `Expr`, and `AtomicExpr`. The method `atoms` in the `Basic` class and the `Atom` class are particularly relevant. The `Expr` and `AtomicExpr` classes are also important as they deal with expressions and can impact the atoms method. Given the context, it's clear that changes should be made in the `Basic` and possibly the `Atom` class to ensure it checks for objects without `.args` rather than just subclasses of `Atom`. Also, the performance impact should be considered.",

The current implementation uses a check for `isinstance(expr, types)` where `types` is set to `(Atom,)` by default, which does not align with the requirement that atoms should have no `.args`. \n\nAnalyzing the `Basic` class, particularly the `atoms` method and related definitions like `Atom` and `AtomicExpr`, shows that the current approach is not correctly identifying objects based on the absence of `.args`. The new logic should check whether an object has `.args` and return it as an atom only if it does not. \n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant spans are identified across `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`, notably `Basic.atoms`, `Atom`, and `AtomicExpr`. These are central to the current implementation and are likely places to modify for the fix.
