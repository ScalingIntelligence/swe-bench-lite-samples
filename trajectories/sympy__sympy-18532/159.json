The method currently returns subclasses of `Atom` when it should return objects that have no `.args`. This discrepancy affects the definition of a leaf node in the expression tree. Given the detailed context of the `atoms` method in `Basic` class and `Atom` subclass within `sympy/core/basic.py` and the `sympy/core/expr.py`, it's reasonable to start the search focusing on these files. The search should specifically look for the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class and its subclasses, especially `Expr` and `AtomicExpr`. Additionally, to ensure the fix doesn't impact performance, a deeper understanding of how `atoms` is used across the codebase may be necessary.",

Upon examining the provided search results, the `Basic` class definition and the `atoms` method implementation are found. The `Basic` class has a slot for `_args`, which indicates the presence of arguments. The current implementation of `atoms` uses `preorder_traversal` to collect all expressions of a given type, defaulting to `Atom` if no types are provided.

The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` uses `isinstance` checks against `Atom`. To address the issue, we need to modify this behavior so that it checks for objects without `.args` instead of checking for `Atom` subclasses. The relevant code spans are in `Basic.atoms` and the definition of `Atom`. The new search results include `Expr` and `Permutation` classes which also have an `atoms` method, and we need to check if these need to be modified as well. Additionally, `MatrixProperties` in `sympy/matrices/common.py` has an `atoms` method that uses `Atom` as the default type, and this might also need adjustment.
