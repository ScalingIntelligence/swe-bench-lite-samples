The primary concern is to ensure that a leaf node should be defined by not having `.args`. The search results include two relevant code spans. The first, in the `Basic` class, defines the class with attributes such as `_args`, which is relevant to checking if a node has arguments. The second span is the implementation of the `atoms` method within the `Basic` class. This method currently uses `preorder_traversal` to collect all nodes of a specific type, which defaults to `Atom`. To address the issue, the method should be modified to check if nodes have `.args` before including them in the result.
