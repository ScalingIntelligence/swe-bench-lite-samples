To fix this, the criterion for identifying a leaf node should be changed to check for the absence of `.args` instead of just being an instance of `Atom`.

The current implementation in the `Basic` class sets the default type for `atoms` to `(Atom,)` if no types are specified, which leads to returning subclasses of `Atom`. The goal is to ensure that leaf nodes (nodes with no `.args`) are identified correctly. Relevant code spans from the search results include the `Basic.atoms` method and the `Atom` class itself. Additionally, the `Basic.__new__` method, where `_args` is set, is relevant for understanding how `args` are assigned to objects and thus determining the leaf nodes.

The issue is about modifying the `atoms` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` to return objects with no `.args` instead of subclasses of `Atom`. The current implementation of the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class uses type checking to determine what constitutes an atom. The method should be updated to check if an object has `.args` instead of checking if it is an instance of `Atom`. This change should consider any implications on performance as mentioned in the original issue.",
