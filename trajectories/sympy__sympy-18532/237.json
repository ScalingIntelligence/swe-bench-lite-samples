The issue specifies that `expr.atoms()` should return objects with no `.args` instead of subclasses of `Atom`. Currently, the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class uses `preorder_traversal` to check instances of `Atom` and adds them to the result. However, this doesn't check for the `.args` property directly. To resolve the issue, we should modify the `atoms` method to check if the expression has no `.args` before including it in the result. This should be done in both the `Basic` class and the `Expr` class (if it inherits or overrides the `atoms` method). Additionally, we need to ensure that changes do not negatively impact performance. Therefore, both the `Basic.atoms` and `Expr` class sections are relevant for identifying the code that needs to be updated.",
