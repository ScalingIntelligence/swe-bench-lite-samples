The provided search results include code spans from `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/matrices/common.py`, and `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. \n\n1. In `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `Basic.atoms()` method is defined, which currently returns objects that are instances of the `Atom` class if no types are specified. This is directly related to the issue as it describes the current behavior to be changed.\n\n2. The `MatrixProperties.atoms()` method in `sympy/matrices/common.py` follows a similar pattern as `Basic.atoms()`, also defaulting to considering instances of `Atom`. This could be another place where the change might need to be applied.\n\n3. The `Permutation.atoms()` method in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` is less directly relevant, as it does not directly involve checking for `Atom` subclasses but rather returns elements from its array form.\n\nBased on these observations, the focus should be on the `Basic.atoms()` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` and potentially the `MatrixProperties.atoms()` method in `sympy/matrices/common.py` to modify how leaf nodes are determined. The code spans in these files that define these methods are the most relevant to addressing the reported issue.\n\nTo address the issue, the check for `isinstance(expr, types)` in the `Basic.atoms()` method should be modified to check for the absence of `.args` instead of being a subclass of `Atom`. Similar changes might be needed in other classes like `MatrixProperties`. The `Permutation.atoms()` method may need review to ensure consistency, but it is less directly tied to the specified issue.",
