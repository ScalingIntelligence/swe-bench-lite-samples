This is a crucial functionality to implement by checking whether the `.args` attribute is empty. The provided code from `sympy/core/basic.py` shows the `Basic` class definition which includes the `atoms()` method. This method currently returns objects based on their types, using `preorder_traversal`. However, it does not explicitly check if the objects have no `.args`. To address the issue, the `atoms()` method should be modified to include this check. Given the content of the search results, it appears that the `atoms()` method is located within a file that defines the `Basic` class, which is appropriate for making necessary modifications.
