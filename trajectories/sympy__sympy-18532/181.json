The current implementation of `atoms()` in the `Basic` class uses `preorder_traversal` to traverse the expression tree and adds expressions to the result if they are instances of the specified types, which by default is `(Atom,)`. This behavior aligns with the current functionality described in the issue. However, to address the issue, we need to modify the `atoms()` method to check if expressions have no `.args` before adding them to the result. The `Basic` class definition, which includes the `_args` attribute, is necessary context for understanding the structure of the objects that `atoms()` operates on. Therefore, both the `Basic` class definition and the `atoms()` method are relevant to resolve the issue.",
