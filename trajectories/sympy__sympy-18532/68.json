Therefore, the focus should be on identifying the method in the relevant classes in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` as these are primary places where the `atoms` method is expected to be implemented and overridden, ensuring that the fix occurs without impacting performance measures.",

This suggests that the definition of a leaf node is being skewed. By examining the `sympy/core/basic.py` file, we can see that the `Basic` class has attributes `_args` which could potentially be used to identify if an expression is a leaf node (i.e., it has no `.args`). The `atoms` method in the same class currently checks for instances of `types` (defaulting to `(Atom,)` if no types are provided). To fix the issue, the method should instead check if an expression has no `.args`. This spans in the file_context are relevant as they define the structure and method for identifying atoms.",

The current implementation in `sympy/core/basic.py` checks if the expression is an instance of `Atom` when no types are provided.
