This implies focusing on functions or methods named `atoms` within the context of objects that might be calling this method, specifically those derived from or interacting with the `Basic` or `Expr` class. The search should prioritize files related to core functionalities or expressions in the sympy library, such as `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`, where such methods are likely defined. Additionally, performance implications should be considered, potentially necessitating checks or adjustments in related modules like `sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py`.",

The current implementation in `Basic.atoms` sets `types` to `(Atom,)` if no types are provided, which is the central focus of the issue. Analyzing the provided code sections in `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, and `sympy/core/expr.py`, the most relevant code span is in `Basic.atoms` where the `types` are set and the atoms are collected. This is the core of the problem described. The other code spans, such as `Permutation.atoms` and `Expr.expr_free_symbols`, are less relevant as they do not address the specific issue of modifying the behavior of `Basic.atoms`. \n\nIn addition to the code spans from `sympy/core/basic.py`, the other sections, especially in `Expr`, might need review if changes in `Basic.atoms` could potentially affect the functionality or performance of `Expr` related operations. However, for the direct fix of the issue, changing the behavior in `Basic.atoms` is the primary concern. \n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans that need to be addressed are primarily in `sympy/core/basic.py` under `Basic.atoms`.",
