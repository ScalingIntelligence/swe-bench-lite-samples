The correct definition of a leaf node should be objects with no `.args`. The relevant files provided in the context clue are `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/expr.py`, and `sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py`. The `Atom` class and its related methods in `basic.py` and `expr.py` are likely the focus for this change. A possible solution is to modify the `atoms` method to only return objects that have no `.args`, instead of relying on the `Atom` subclass. Also, since this change might impact performance, checking this aspect is crucial. Therefore, I will include the `Atom` class name and the `atoms` method name in the search parameters.",
