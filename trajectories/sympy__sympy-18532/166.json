This discrepancy appears in the `Basic.atoms` method, where the types default to `(Atom,)` if no arguments are provided. This needs to be changed to check for objects with no `.args` instead. The `Basic` class definition, which includes attributes like `_args`, is relevant for understanding what constitutes a leaf node. Additionally, the `Lambdifier.sympy_atoms_namespace` method in `sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py` is also relevant as it uses `expr.atoms()` and could be affected by any changes made. These code spans are crucial for understanding and implementing the fix to ensure that only objects with no `.args` are returned as leaf nodes.",

This method is central to the reported issue as it controls the retrieval of atoms in an expression. The current implementation filters atoms based on their types, defaulting to the `Atom` class if no specific types are provided. This is to be modified according to the issue, where only objects with no `.args` should be returned, which aligns with the definition of a leaf node. Evaluation of performance impact is also part of the issue, which suggests testing the modified method. Additional context in `sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py` shows usage of the `atoms` method for symbol and number extraction, which indirectly supports the relevance to the issue even though detailed implementation in plot drawing does not directly appear in the context. Given this information, I conclude the file context is complete for evaluating the current state and possibly implementing the required changes in the `atoms` method.",
