Currently, `expr.atoms()` returns subclasses of `Atom` even when they have `.args`, which goes against the definition of a leaf node. The fix should ensure that only objects with no `.args` are returned by `expr.atoms()`. The search results include the `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py`, which defines both the `Basic` class and the `atoms` method. This method is crucial for the function in question. The `atoms` method currently uses `preorder_traversal` to traverse the expressions and check if the expression is an instance of the given types, which defaults to `Atom` if no types are specified. This is exactly where the fix needs to be applied. By identifying this section of code, I can confirm that the search results are relevant to the reported issue, specifically the `atoms` method in the `Basic` class.
