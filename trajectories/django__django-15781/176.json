Given the code snippet and expected output, it's clear that the 'help' command output doesn't match the expected format. It appears the 'BaseCommand' class and its subclasses might be relevant, especially the 'create_parser' method and the 'HelpFormatter' related methods in 'django/core/management/base.py'. To further investigate, let's target this file and also consider other subclasses of 'BaseCommand' in files like 'migrate.py', 'makemigrations.py', etc., that might also customize the help output.",

The file context does not, however, include specific instances of management commands (like 'tzkt_import') which would typically inherit from 'BaseCommand'. To determine if the specific issue (customizing the help output for 'tzkt_import') is fully addressed, one would need to check management commands defined elsewhere in the codebase or consider extending the capabilities of 'BaseCommand' as shown in the file context.
