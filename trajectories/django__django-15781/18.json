The search results provide several relevant code spans that can help in identifying the necessary modifications. First, the 'DjangoHelpFormatter' class seems relevant as it is responsible for formatting the help output. Specifically, the 'add_usage' and 'add_arguments' methods within this class will likely need adjustments. These methods handle adding usage and arguments to the formatter, respectively, which could be where the issue with the formatting lies. Additionally, the 'BaseCommand' class and its 'create_parser' method are also relevant. This method is where the CommandParser is initialized with the DjangoHelpFormatter, indicating this is where any customization would need to be applied. The 'BaseCommand.add_arguments' method, though currently empty, might need to be implemented or adjusted to handle the custom formatting for arguments as described in the issue. Overall, these code spans provide the necessary context and starting points for addressing the reported issue.",
