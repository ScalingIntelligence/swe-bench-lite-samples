Specifically, the example usage within the help message is expected to be more visually separated and formatted compared to the current output.\n\n2. Review Current Context:\n   No relevant code has been identified yet.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n   3.1. Thoroughly analyze each code span in the <search_results> tag.\n      - The code spans include classes and methods related to command parsing and help formatting in Django's core management module.\n   3.2. Match the code spans with the key elements, functions, variables, or patterns identified in the reported issue.\n      - The 'BaseCommand' class and its 'create_parser' method are relevant as they deal with command creation and help message formatting.\n       - The 'DjangoHelpFormatter' class and its methods like 'add_usage' and 'add_arguments' are likely responsible for the formatting of help messages.\n   3.3. Evaluate the relevance of each code span based on how well it aligns with the reported issue and current file context.\n      - The 'DjangoHelpFormatter' class and its methods directly impact the formatting of the help output and are thus highly relevant to the issue.\n\n   3.4. If the issue suggests new functions or classes, identify the existing code that might be relevant to be able to implement the new functionality.\n      - No new functions or classes are suggested; the issue pertains to improving the existing formatting of help messages.\n\n   3.5. Review entire sections of code, not just isolated spans, to ensure you have a complete understanding before making a decision.\n      - The sections reviewed include both the base command class and the custom help formatter class, providing a comprehensive view of command creation and help message handling.\n\n   3.6. Verify if there are references to other parts of the codebase that might be relevant but not found in the search results.\n      - No additional references are found in the provided search results that would indicate other relevant parts of the codebase.\n\n   3.7. Identify and extract relevant code spans based on the reported issue.\n      - The 'BaseCommand' class, particularly its 'create_parser' method.\n      - The 'DjangoHelpFormatter' class and its methods 'add_usage' and 'add_arguments'.\n\n4.
