The expected help output should format the example usage correctly according to the given example. To address this, it's necessary to look into the help formatting logic within the management command framework. The BaseCommand class and related classes like DjangoHelpFormatter might be the starting points since they handle the command's parser and help text generation. Additionally, focusing on the specific management command file that contains the Command class definition with the help attribute will help pinpoint where the customization should be applied.",
