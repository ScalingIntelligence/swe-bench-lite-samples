Specifically, the issue is that the example usage is not formatted correctly in the help output. The current help output places the example usage on the same line as the usage description, which is not aligned with the expectation.\n\nFrom the file context, we see a class `DjangoHelpFormatter` which seems to handle the formatting of the help output. This class includes methods like `_reordered_actions`, `add_usage`, and `add_arguments`, which suggest that it is involved in how the arguments and usage instructions are displayed.\n\nIn the new search results, we find the `BaseCommand` class which is extended by the custom command mentioned in the issue. The `BaseCommand` class includes methods such as `create_parser`, `print_help`, and `handle`, among others. Specifically, the `create_parser` method is responsible for creating the argument parser with the help formatter, and `print_help` is used to print the help message.\n\nTo address the issue, it seems relevant to focus on how the help message is formatted and printed. The `BaseCommand` class is where the custom command inherits from, and thus changes related to how the help message is constructed and displayed would need to be made here.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans are those related to the `BaseCommand` class and its methods that are involved in creating and displaying the help message, particularly `create_parser` and `print_help`.",
