By analyzing the search results, I have identified relevant code spans in the 'django/core/management/base.py' file. This file contains the implementation of the BaseCommand class, which is responsible for defining the behavior of management commands in Django. Specifically, the 'create_parser' method in the BaseCommand class initializes the parser for the command and sets various options and arguments. The 'DjangoHelpFormatter' class and its methods, such as 'add_usage' and 'add_arguments', are also relevant as they handle the formatting of the help text for the command. These code spans are potentially responsible for the formatting issue described in the reported issue. By understanding the current implementation and how the help text is being generated, we can identify the necessary modifications to achieve the desired output format as described in the issue.",
