The task is to find where these exceptions are being raised or handled in the codebase, particularly in the context of how the requests library interacts with urllib3. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the `exceptions.py` modules and the `connectionpool.py`, `response.py`, and `poolmanager.py` files, where network operations and handling could occur, is a starting point.",

Specifically, the user wants to confirm if requests are designed to wrap urllib3 exceptions into requests.exceptions types, and if not, they want to understand how these exceptions are currently handled. They mentioned specifically requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError. In the provided search results, several relevant code spans are found in 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' and 'requests/packages/urllib3/util/retry.py'. These files contain code related to handling connection pools, timeouts, and retries, which are directly related to the exceptions mentioned in the issue. It is observed that TimeoutError and ReadTimeoutError are being handled within the HTTPConnectionPool and HTTPSConnectionPool classes. The '_raise_timeout' method specifically deals with raising ReadTimeoutError based on SocketTimeout exceptions. Additionally, the Retry class in 'retry.py' deals with error handling and retries, indicating it's likely managing exceptions like TimeoutError. While not all details of exception handling are explicitly shown in the provided spans, enough context is given to confirm that these files are focused on managing and handling exceptions, which is directly related to the issue. The search task is considered complete as relevant code spans have been identified.",
