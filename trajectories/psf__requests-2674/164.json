The provided file context emphasizes the need to address DecodeError and TimeoutError from urllib3. Based on the current and new search results, the crucial code spans involve the definitions and handling of these exceptions. Consequently, the search should target sections in the codebase that instantiate or manage DecodeError, TimeoutError, or closely related exceptions such as ReadTimeoutError and ConnectTimeoutError. Additionally, key areas involve catching these exceptions in HTTPAdapter.send and HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen methods to determine if they are properly handled or rethrown. Strikingly, the code context elucidates strategic sections where exceptions are elevated or processed based on their type during HTTP interactions. The analysis indicates crucial touchpoints whereby sockets might timeout (resulting in ReadTimeoutError) and the necessity to arbitrarily refresh connections or selectively retry, considering pertinent conditions. Lastly, the review identifies ethos within redirect mixin methods and rebuild proxies that lend significance when scrutinizing HTTP redirection safeguards, particularly when added proxy setups intervene, but these bear less relativity to the acute concern at hand.",

The issue specifically mentions catching `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`. Examining the provided context and search results, we need to focus on code spans that handle these exceptions or define them. From the file context, we have definitions for `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` in `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py`. In the connection handling, `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` shows a method `_raise_timeout` associated with `ReadTimeoutError`, derived from `TimeoutError`. The new search results in `requests/adapters.py` display the handling of various exceptions in the `send` method of the `HTTPAdapter` class. Notably, this method catches `ReadTimeoutError` and raises `ReadTimeout`, which should be relevant to the issue. This analysis indicates the identified spans are consistent with the reported issue.",

However, the context does not explicitly show how these exceptions, particularly DecodeError and TimeoutError, are handled or re-raised within the requests library. It indicates that while urllib3 exceptions like ReadTimeoutError are specially handled and converted into requests-specific exceptions (e.g., ReadTimeout), there's no clear evidence in the provided code snippets that DecodeError and TimeoutError are similarly managed. This suggests that these exceptions might indeed pass through the requests API as per the issue report. To fully confirm this and assess whether the requests library appropriately wraps or handles these exceptions, further inspection of the code where HTTP requests are actually made and exceptions handled (e.g., in requests/adapters.py or similar areas) would be necessary.",
