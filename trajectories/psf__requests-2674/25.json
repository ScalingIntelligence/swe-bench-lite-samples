Given the context, it's crucial to identify how these exceptions are handled within the requests library. From the search results, several key points are noticeable:\n\n1. The exceptions DecodeError and TimeoutError are already defined in the urllib3.exceptions module within the requests library, under the HTTPError hierarchy.\n2. In the adapters.py file, HTTPAdapter imports and uses urllib3 exceptions like ConnectTimeoutError, ProxyError, etc., potentially where these exceptions could pass through the requests API.\n3. The sessions.py file shows how Session and its mixins handle redirection and request sending, which could be the pathway for these exceptions to propagate.\n4. The connectionpool.py file directly references ReadTimeoutError and TimeoutError, showing how the connection pool manages timeouts, which links closely to the reported issue.\n\nBased on these findings, it is evident that the current analysis has identified files and code spans that are highly relevant to the reported issue of urllib3 exceptions passing through the requests API. The identified spans include the definitions of relevant exceptions in urllib3.exceptions, as well as their potential propagation points in the HTTPAdapter class and Session handling. This covers the required context to understand and potentially address the issue of urllib3 exceptions within the requests library.",

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
