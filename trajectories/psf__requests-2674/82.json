I also looked for the parts of the code where these exceptions might be handled or propagated within the requests library. The analysis of the code spans revealed that DecodeError and TimeoutError are defined in 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py'. Furthermore, the 'HTTPAdapter.send' method in 'requests/adapters.py' shows the handling of timeouts, suggesting where TimeoutError might be raised. Additionally, 'Session.send' in 'requests/sessions.py' is a crucial method used by the Session class to send requests and could potentially handle or propagate these exceptions. Given the report of DecodeError and TimeoutError exceptions, these identified file paths and spans seem relevant and likely to contribute to a solution.",

The user is interested in understanding whether these exceptions should be wrapped in requests.exceptions and captured accordingly. From the file context, we see definitions of relevant urllib3 exceptions such as DecodeError and TimeoutError, which are derived from HTTPError. The adapters.py and sessions.py files contain important code spans related to how requests interact with urllib3 for handling HTTP connections and sessions. These files already showed some handling of urllib3 exceptions within the HTTPAdapter class in adapters.py and the Session class in sessions.py. The new search results likewise focus on these key areas, emphasizing the functionality of HTTPAdapter and its handling of various aspects including timeouts, retries, and building responses. The send method in both HTTPAdapter and Session demonstrates extensive handling of HTTP request issues including wrapping certain urllib3 exceptions like ConnectTimeoutError and ProtocolError within ConnectionError exceptions from requests. This indicates a design that aims to translate lower-level exceptions into domain-specific exceptions which appears to partially meet the user's query on exception handling. Aligning with the reported issue, the identified code spans thus provide a clear picture of how exceptions seen during low-level HTTP operations are managed within the context of the higher-level requests library.",

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
