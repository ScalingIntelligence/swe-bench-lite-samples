The search results expand this context by providing more details about how these exceptions are used and how they relate to other exceptions in the requests library. Specifically, the 'requests/exceptions.py' file shows the inheritance hierarchy of exceptions within the requests library, including RequestException, HTTPError, ConnectionError, ProxyError, and others. The 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' file provides further context on how timeouts are handled within the connection pool, with specific handling for ReadTimeoutError. This information helps confirm the need to catch urllib3 exceptions like DecodeError and TimeoutError in addition to requests' exceptions.
