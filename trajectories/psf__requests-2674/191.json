Specifically, exceptions such as DecodeError and TimeoutError from urllib3 are leaking through the requests API, which should ideally be wrapped around requests' exceptions. To address this, we need to identify where these exceptions are being handled or potentially where they are being propagated without proper wrapping in the requests library. We should focus our search on key areas of interest where HTTP requests are made, exceptions are handled or where urllib3 is directly interacted with.",

The main focus is on two specific exceptions: `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`. The search results provided show multiple files and spans that might be relevant to this issue. The file `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` contains several spans that handle various aspects of connection pooling and error handling, including timeout errors. The span `HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout` specifically deals with raising timeout errors, which is directly relevant to the reported issue. Another relevant span is `HTTPConnectionPool._make_request`, which involves making HTTP requests and handling exceptions, potentially related to DecodeError since it includes validation of connections. The file `requests/packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py` shows how the pool manager handles URLs and connections, which might indirectly relate to the exceptions reported. Finally, `requests/packages/urllib3/util/retry.py` contains logic for retrying connections and handling various errors, which might also be relevant to understanding how these exceptions are managed or could be managed in the future. Overall, the identified spans provide a good starting point to understand how timeout and decoding errors are handled within the context of the requests package, but further analysis might be needed to fully address the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves urllib3 exceptions passing through the requests API. Specifically, it mentions needing to catch urllib3's DecodeError and TimeoutError in addition to requests' exceptions. This suggests a need to investigate how urllib3 exceptions are handled or propagated within the requests library. \n\nFrom the provided file context, we see that exceptions from urllib3 are imported and used in the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' file. This file handles HTTP connections and includes handling for timeouts and other errors. The 'HTTPConnectionPool' class has methods that deal with timeouts and exceptions such as '_raise_timeout' and '_make_request', which might be related.\n\nIn the search results, there are several relevant files:\n- 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py': This file contains the 'HTTPResponse' class where the DecodeError and ReadTimeoutError are potentially being handled. Specifically, the '_decode' method might handle DecodeError and the 'read' method might handle ReadTimeoutError.\n- 'requests/adapters.py': This file has the 'HTTPAdapter' class, which is responsible for sending requests and handling responses, encapsulating lower-level networking details. Its 'send' method deals with handling various exceptions, including timeouts.\n- 'requests/exceptions.py': This file defines custom exceptions for the requests library, some of which are related to timeouts and connectivity issues.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the initial analysis of the code, it seems relevant to investigate the code spans where urllib3 exceptions are either handled or propagated within the requests library to determine if there is a need to modify the exception handling or wrapping mechanism around urllib3 exceptions. This could include checking the conditions under which DecodeError and TimeoutError are thrown or caught and considering if these exceptions should be wrapped in a requests-specific exception format, if this is indeed a design goal not yet achieved.",
