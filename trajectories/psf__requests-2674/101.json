The user specifically mentions two exceptions they are encountering: requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError, indicating a need to confirm if these exceptions are handled or exposed appropriately within the requests library.\n\nReviewing the current file context, the definitions of DecodeError and TimeoutError in the urllib3 exceptions module are provided. These inherit from HTTPError, which suggests they are not being wrapped in a more specific requests exception.\n\nIn the search results, the exceptions.py file contains a hierarchy of requests exceptions starting from RequestException. Notably, not all the urllib3 exceptions map directly to a requests exception, suggesting an incomplete exception handling strategy if the goal is to always wrap urllib3 exceptions. The adapters.py file shows the HTTPAdapter class which uses urllib3 exceptions, but there isn't direct wrapping or mapping to requests' exception types. This hints at a design where urllib3 exceptions might pass through directly in certain scenarios. For instance, TimeoutError and DecodeError from urllib3 would not be automatically translated to a requests-specific exception without specific handling.\n\nThis analysis shows that if the design goal is to wrap all urllib3 exceptions in requests exceptions, there are gaps in the current implementation. This issue might require re-evaluation or further handling to meet that goal. Importantly, the current setup indeed allows urllib3 exceptions to pass through as reported, which seems to lack handling in a way that aligns with the user's expectation of their being wrapped by requests' exceptions.",

From the file context provided, we see the definitions of these exceptions in 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py', and their handling and wrapping in 'requests/exceptions.py'. The new search results in 'requests/adapters.py' show how the HTTPAdapter class integrates with urllib3, including the handling of urllib3 exceptions such as ConnectTimeoutError, _HTTPError, _ProxyError, and ReadTimeoutError. These results help confirm how exceptions are being passed through and potentially unhandled as per the issue.

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
