            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about exceptions from urllib3 passing through the requests API. The main focus is on whether requests should wrap urllib3 exceptions with its own exception types and specifically mentions two exceptions: `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`. The search results provide insights into how urllib3 exceptions are handled within the requests package, particularly in the `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` file where the `HTTPConnectionPool` class deals with connection timeouts and other errors.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified involve error handling and the `TimeoutError` specifically. The `_raise_timeout` method within `HTTPConnectionPool` converts `SocketTimeout` errors into `ReadTimeoutError`, which is a part of urllib3's exception handling. This suggests that some urllib3 exceptions are being wrapped into requests-specific exceptions, although the specific exceptions mentioned in the issue (DecodeError and TimeoutError) are not explicitly handled in the spans provided.\n\nAdditionally, the `Retry` class in `requests/packages/urllib3/util/retry.py` is relevant as it deals with retry logic and possible exceptions like `ReadTimeoutError`. This class could be where custom handling for the exceptions mentioned in the issue might be configured or extended.\n\nOverall, while the specific exceptions mentioned in the issue are not directly handled in the provided code spans, the general pattern of handling and possibly wrapping urllib3 exceptions within requests is present, suggesting that the current design might already be aligned with the request to ensure consistency in exception handling across the requests API.\n\nGiven the scope of the issue, which is about the propagation and handling of urllib3 exceptions within the requests package, the provided search results seem to touch upon the relevant aspects, but a more detailed examination of the entire codebase, particularly in the areas not covered by the provided spans, might be necessary to fully address the issue.",

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
