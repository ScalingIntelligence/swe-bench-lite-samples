The main focus is on exceptions such as requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError. From the context provided, it seems like the codebases already contain relevant pieces of code that handle various exceptions. To find a more precise solution, we should look deeper into the relation between requests and urllib3 in handling exceptions, especially in files related to connection pooling and response handling where these exceptions might be raised or passed through.",

The provided search results include several files and code spans within the `requests/packages/urllib3` module. The most relevant code spans are those that handle or raise exceptions, particularly those related to timeouts and decoding. The code in `connectionpool.py` handles timeouts and defines several exception types. Specifically, the `HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout` method raises `ReadTimeoutError` which is likely related to the `TimeoutError` mentioned in the issue. In `response.py`, the `HTTPResponse._decode` method handles decoding errors which could be related to `DecodeError`. Additionally, `connectionpool.py` also includes imports and definitions of various exceptions that are relevant to the issue. Therefore, these code spans are directly related to the exceptions mentioned in the issue and are crucial for understanding how exceptions are managed and potentially modified in the requests library.",
