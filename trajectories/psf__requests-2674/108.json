This indicates a need to investigate the integration and exception handling mechanisms between requests and urllib3. Specifically, we should focus on the parts of the codebase where urllib3 exceptions might be thrown and where requests would need to catch and handle them appropriately. The mentioned exceptions, DecodeError and TimeoutError, are likely to be found in the urllib3.exceptions module, and their handling would need to be checked in the higher-level modules of the requests library, especially in the adapters or session management parts where HTTP requests are made and managed.",

These include TimeoutError, which is directly related to the issue. Additionally, there are code spans in 'requests/adapters.py' that handle exceptions such as ProtocolError, ConnectTimeoutError, MaxRetryError, ProxyError, _SSLError, and _HTTPError, which are also relevant as they show how different types of errors are caught and handled within the requests library. The code in 'requests/sessions.py' relates to session management and redirection handling, which, while not directly addressing the exception wrapping issue, is contextually relevant to understanding the overall error handling workflow in the library.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they involve the definition and handling of exceptions within the requests library, particularly those related to urllib3 exceptions.

Specifically, the user is noting that they have to catch urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError in addition to requests' exceptions. This indicates a need to review the handling of these exceptions within the requests library to ensure they are either wrapped in requests' exception types or directly managed in a way that aligns with the library's design goals.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, it's evident that the exceptions are defined in `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py` and used in `requests/adapters.py`. The relevant parts of the code include the definitions of `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` in the exceptions module, and the `send` method in the `HTTPAdapter` class within the adapters module. This method manages the connection and potential exceptions during HTTP requests. It's crucial to ensure that when these urllib3 exceptions occur, they are properly wrapped or handled to maintain a consistent API for the requests library.",
