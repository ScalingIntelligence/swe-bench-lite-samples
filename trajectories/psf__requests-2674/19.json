From the provided context and search results, it's clear that these exceptions are indeed defined in requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py. Additionally, in the adapters.py file, the HTTPAdapter class handles exceptions where urllib3 exceptions like MaxRetryError, ConnectTimeoutError, ResponseError, _ProxyError, _SSLError, and _HTTPError are caught and re-raised as requests exceptions such as ConnectionError, ConnectTimeout, ReadTimeout, SSLError, ProxyError, and RetryError.
