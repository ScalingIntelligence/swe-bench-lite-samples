Based on the current file context, both these exceptions are already defined in the 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' file. Looking at the new search results, the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' file contains spans that are potentially relevant, particularly those dealing with timeouts. The '_raise_timeout' method in the HTTPConnectionPool class is of particular interest as it specifically handles and raises ReadTimeoutError based on various conditions related to timeouts. This method could be the point where handling for the TimeoutError might need to be adjusted or verified to ensure it aligns with the issue reported. The 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' file also contains relevant code spans, especially where the DecodeError might be managed during the decoding process of HTTP responses, as seen in the '_init_decoder' and '_decode' methods of the HTTPResponse class. These sections are crucial as they interact with the handling of content encoding and potential errors during decompression, which could involve the DecodeError. Given the nature of the reported issue, focusing on these specific sections of code should provide a comprehensive view into how urllib3 exceptions are managed within the requests API and whether there's a need for improvement in their handling.",

Additionally, the connectionpool module is relevant as it imports and potentially raises these exceptions. The HTTPConnectionPool class in connectionpool is responsible for managing and manipulating connections, where timeouts and decoding errors could occur. In the code, _raise_timeout method specifically deals with raising TimeoutError, and the _init_decoder method in the HTTPResponse class relates to decoding processes, potentially raising DecodeError.
