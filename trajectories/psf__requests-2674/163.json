The user has specifically mentioned requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that handle or raise these exceptions within the requests and urllib3 codebases. Based on the search results, several code spans are relevant:\n\n1. In 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py', the 'HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen' span handles exceptions like TimeoutError, BaseSSLError, CertificateError, HTTPException, and SocketError. This is directly relevant as it deals with how urllib3 exceptions are managed within the context of requests.\n\n2. In 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', the 'HTTPResponse.read' span catches SocketTimeout and BaseSSLError, raising ReadTimeoutError in response. This is relevant because it shows how urllib3's timeout exceptions are specifically handled and wrapped.\n\n3. In 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py', there are several spans defining different exceptions including TimeoutError, ReadTimeoutError, ConnectTimeoutError, and others. This is foundational for understanding the exception types that may pass through the requests API.\n\nThese spans collectively provide a comprehensive view of how urllib3 exceptions, including the mentioned TimeoutError and DecodeError, are integrated and handled within the requests library. They demonstrate the mechanisms in place for managing these exceptions, which is critical for resolving the user's issue.",

Additionally, the 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py' file contains the handling of SocketTimeout, which is likely to be the cause of the TimeoutError when a proxy times out. The 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' file also defines the TimeoutError and ReadTimeoutError exceptions, which confirms their presence in the context.

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
