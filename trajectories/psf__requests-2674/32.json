The search results include several urllib3 exception classes defined in 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' such as 'TimeoutError' and 'DecodeError', which are directly related to the issue. Additionally, in 'requests/adapters.py', the 'HTTPAdapter' class is handling various urllib3 exceptions like 'ConnectTimeoutError', 'ReadTimeoutError', and 'ProtocolError', and reraising them as exceptions from the requests library, which indicates that the handling of urllib3 exceptions is a concern here. These findings directly address the reported issue by providing insights into how urllib3 exceptions are managed within the requests library, confirming or disproving the hypothesis that they are wrapped or reraised by requests.exceptions. This information is crucial for understanding how to catch and handle urllib3 exceptions when using the requests library.",
