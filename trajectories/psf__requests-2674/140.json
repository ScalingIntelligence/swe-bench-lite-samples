Specifically, it mentions two exceptions, DecodeError and TimeoutError, that are not being wrapped by requests' own exceptions as intended. To address this, I need to find the relevant sections in the codebase that handle, raise, or propagate these exceptions. Given the structure of the library, focusing on the connection and response handling parts within the urllib3 package inside requests seems appropriate.",

In 'requests/packages/urllib3/response.py', there are classes and methods that handle decompression (like DeflateDecoder and GzipDecoder) and the HTTPResponse class, which includes the _decode method that raises DecodeError. This directly relates to the handling of DecodeError as mentioned in the issue. In 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py', various exception classes including DecodeError and TimeoutError are defined, matching the specific exceptions mentioned in the issue. In 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py', the HTTPConnectionPool class contains methods related to handling timeouts, which aligns with theTimeoutError mentioned in the issue.
