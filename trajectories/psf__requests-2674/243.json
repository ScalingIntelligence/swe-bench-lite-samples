The new search results from adapters.py and sessions.py provide context on how these exceptions might be handled or propagated within the requests library.\n\nThe HTTPAdapter class in adapters.py includes a send method that handles various types of errors including ProtocolError and socket.error, which are potential parent classes for the mentioned exceptions. It also specifically raises ReadTimeoutError in response to SocketTimeout errors, indicating a direct handling of a scenario involving TimeoutError.\n\nIn sessions.py, the SessionRedirectMixin class does not directly handle exceptions or deal with the urllib3 exceptions of interest here. This part of the code seems unrelated to the specific issue at hand, focusing instead on proxy management during redirection.\n\nBy analyzing the context and the new search results, we can determine which code spans are relevant to the reported issue concerning the translation of urllib3 exceptions through the requests API.",

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
