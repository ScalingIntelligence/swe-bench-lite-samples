The issue specifically mentions two exceptions: DecodeError and TimeoutError, both of which are defined in the urllib3 exceptions module. The analysis of the code reveals that these exceptions are appropriately raised under specific conditions. For example, TimeoutError is raised when a request times out, and this is managed within the urlopen method in the connectionpool module. Additionally, the HTTPAdapter class in adapters.py handles these exceptions and converts them into requests' exceptions like ConnectionError or ReadTimeout. This indicates that the existing codebase manages these exceptions comprehensively, translating them into requests-specific exceptions to maintain a consistent API for consumers.",

Furthermore, in the connectionpool.py file, the TimeoutError exception is explicitly caught and handled in the HTTPConnectionPool class's urlopen method, suggesting careful management of these exceptions. In the adapters.py file, the HTTPAdapter class handles various exceptions, including socket errors and protocol errors, but does not explicitly catch DecodeError.

The user is looking to determine if requests should be wrapping urllib3 exceptions and providing their own exceptions instead. Specifically, the user mentions two exceptions: DecodeError and TimeoutError from the urllib3 exceptions module. In the search results and file context, we find that urllib3's exceptions module includes both DecodeError and TimeoutError, which are subclasses of HTTPError, and TimeoutError has further subclasses like ConnectTimeoutError and ReadTimeoutError in the urllib3 connectionpool module. These exceptions are handled in the HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen method where they are either raised or processed further. Additionally, in the adapters.py file, we see handling of TimeoutError and other related exceptions in the HTTPAdapter.send method, which is the bridge between requests and urllib3. Given these findings, it appears that the relevant modules and methods are present that deal with the exceptions mentioned by the user. However, the issue of whether requests should wrap these exceptions into their own type remains, and the current implementation seems to be designed to let these exceptions pass through as is.",

Given the file context, specific methods to inspect include `urlopen` in `connectionpool.py`, where various connection-related errors, including DecodeError, could be handled or propagated incorrectly. Additionally, cross-reference this with the HTTPAdapter class in `adapters.py`, which could also play a role in how these exceptions are controlled or leaked in the overall system.

This suggests that while the file context identifies the potential area where DecodeError could be handled, it does not explicitly address how DecodeError is managed or propagated within the URLConnectionPool class in relation to the reported issue. The HTTPAdapter class, which also appears in the context, might also play a role in managing these exceptions, but the provided code does not delve deeply into this aspect.

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
