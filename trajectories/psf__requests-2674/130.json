In `connectionpool.py`, the `HTTPConnectionPool` class and its methods (`_get_timeout`, `_raise_timeout`, `_make_request`, and `urlopen`) are central to managing and raising exceptions such as `TimeoutError` and `ReadTimeoutError`. This includes the handling of `SocketTimeout` and other exceptions that may be wrapped into `ReadTimeoutError`. \n\n2. The `Retry` class in `retry.py` manages the backoff and retry logic, which is relevant when exceptions are encountered. It handles specific exceptions like `ConnectTimeoutError` and `ReadTimeoutError`, aligning with the issue's concern about handling various timeout errors. \n\n3. The `exceptions.py` file directly defines `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`, which are the specific exceptions mentioned in the issue that should be handled by the requests API. \n\nGiven this analysis, the identified code spans are highly relevant to address the reported issue, as they directly handle the exceptions arising from urllib3 and manage their propagation or wrapping within the requests API.",

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
