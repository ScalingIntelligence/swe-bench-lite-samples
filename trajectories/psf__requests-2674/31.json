In `urllib3/response.py`, the `_decode` method contains handling for a `DecodeError`, which directly addresses the exception type mentioned in the issue.

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
