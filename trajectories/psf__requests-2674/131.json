This suggests that these exceptions are not being properly wrapped or caught by the requests library, possibly indicating a design choice or a bug worth investigating.\n\nThe search results provided contain several relevant files and code spans that might address the issue. In `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py`, there are definitions for various exceptions including `TimeoutError` and `DecodeError`. These are candidates for the exceptions mentioned in the issue. Furthermore, the `connectionpool.py` file contains methods relevant to handling timeouts and connection errors, which suggests that this file might also be responsible for raising the `TimeoutError` under certain conditions.\n\nLastly, `response.py` includes handling for decoding errors, which could be related to the `DecodeError` exception. This suggests that the encoding or decoding process in the response handling part of the library might be failing and raising exceptions not caught by a higher level of the API.\n\nOverall, the provided search results appear to be highly relevant to the issue.
