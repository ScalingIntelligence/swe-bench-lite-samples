However, the broader exception handling mechanisms are evident, such as the handling of SSLError, ConnectionError, and various socket errors. These suggest that while detailed specific exception handling for DecodeError and TimeoutError isn't explicitly stated, the general framework for handling exceptions and possibly re-raising them with more context exists.

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
