The key exceptions mentioned are `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`. From the file context provided, we have already identified these exceptions along with their related classes in `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py`. Additionally, we have seen how `TimeoutError` and related exceptions such as `ReadTimeoutError` are handled in `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`. \n\nThe new search results contain additional relevant code: \n1. In `requests/adapters.py`, the `HTTPAdapter.send` method handles various exceptions including `ProtocolError`, `socket.error`, `MaxRetryError`, `ProxyError`, `SSLError`, and `HTTPError`. This method is responsible for sending the request and handling the response, which is crucial for understanding how exceptions are managed. \n2. In `requests/sessions.py`, the `Session.send` method calls the `HTTPAdapter.send` method and also manages the request process, including adapter selection based on the URL. This method integrates adapters with the session handling, showing how exceptions might propagate through the session-adapter interaction. \n3. The `RequestException` class in `requests/exceptions.py` is a higher-level exception that is raised when lower-level exceptions (like those from urllib3) are encountered. However, since the request concerns specific urllib3 exceptions, the focus remains on handling these directly in the adapter and connection pool layers. \n\nThese additional files provide insight into how lower-level exceptions from urllib3 are either directly intercepted and handled in the adapter layer or how they propagate through the session handling in the higher-level request processing. Each of these aspects is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of exception handling in the requests library.",

The file context provided already includes definitions for these exceptions in the urllib3.exceptions module. Additionally, I observed how these exceptions are handled in the requests.adapters and requests.sessions modules, with HTTPAdapter.send and Session.send methods showing how urllib3 exceptions are caught and potentially reraised. From the provided new search results, I can see that the HTTPAdapter.send method in the requests.adapters module is the central place where these exceptions are caught and reraised as requests exceptions. This corroborates with the issue that the user is facing. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans that handle urllib3's exceptions mapping to requests' exceptions are found in the HTTPAdapter.send method in the requests.adapters module.",

In 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py', there's a method '_raise_timeout' that checks for SocketTimeout and raises a ReadTimeoutError. 'requests/adapters.py' also treats specific errors such as ProtocolError, socket.error, and MaxRetryError, indirectly involving TimeoutError.
