Specifically, it mentions requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError passing through without being wrapped in requests.exceptions types. To address this, we need to look into files where urllib3 exceptions might be raised and how they are handled within the requests library. Relevant files include those where urllib3 exceptions are defined, such as `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py`, and where these exceptions might be used or caught, such as `requests/adapters.py` or `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`.",

The relevant classes for the report are TimeoutError and its subclass ReadTimeoutError, as they match the exception types the user is seeking to catch. Additionally, the user might be interested in seeing the handling of TimeoutError in the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' file, specifically in the HTTPConnectionPool class where _raise_timeout method is found, which raises ReadTimeoutError. This method is relevant as it deals with timeout exceptions directly related to the user's concern.\n\nRegarding the DecodeError mentioned in the issue, it wasn't found in the provided search results. This might suggest that the search results may not be complete, or DecodeError is not present in the sections of the code provided.

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
