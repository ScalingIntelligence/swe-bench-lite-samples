            "scratch_pad": "The provided search results from the `requests` library codebase delve into how exceptions from `urllib3` are managed and potentially passed through the API. The reported issue seeks clarity on whether `requests` deliberately wraps `urllib3` exceptions within its own `requests.exceptions` types, specifically mentioning `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`. Exploring the `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py` and `requests/exceptions.py` files reveals the direct inheritance hierarchy of these exceptions. The context includes `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` defined within the `urllib3` exceptions module, showing they inherit from `HTTPError`. Following up in the `requests/exceptions.py`, it's apparent that `requests` has a variety of exception classes that might serve as wrappers for `urllib3` exceptions. Among them, `RequestException` is pivotal as it is the base class for most `requests` exceptions, potentially being used to wrap exceptions from `urllib3`. Moving into the search results, `requests/adapters.py` showcases the integration of `urllib3` exceptions within the `HTTPAdapter` class, emphasizing handling in network communication processes. This aligns directly with catching and potentially wrapping `urllib3` exceptions. Another significant file is `requests/models.py`, where the `Response` class methods integrate directly with `urllib3` exceptions such as `DecodeError`, `ReadTimeoutError`, and `ProtocolError`, indicating a potential point where `urllib3` exceptions could be re-raised or wrapped by `requests` exceptions. Assuming the goal of the request is to modify 'requests' to adequately hide 'urllib3' exceptions unless necessary by wrapping them when passed through or otherwise escalating, analysis shows that modification primarily requires looking into the 'HTTPAdapter' class for code contributions by lifting exception handling into 'requests' exceptions either at initiation or during retries. Transformation of 'requests/models.py' might also be needed wherever an 'urllib3' exception may discreetly inject itself into the application layer from underneath what ought to  be trapping responsibility in 'requests', coding this except together with proper issues\u2019 documentation to alert future CDLs. Thus, these files and specific spans in the results are relevant to addressing the reported issue. However, more exhaustive analysis in the pose of both 'connect' & 'read' timeouts may be needed.",
