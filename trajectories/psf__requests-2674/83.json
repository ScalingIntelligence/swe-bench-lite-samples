I've identified two relevant code spans in the 'requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py' file that define the DecodeError and TimeoutError exceptions. Additionally, I found the 'requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py' file, specifically the '_raise_timeout' method, which handles the TimeoutError and might be relevant to how timeouts are managed. Although the issue suggests that these exceptions should be wrapped, the current codebase does not seem to explicitly handle this. Further investigation might be needed to address this gap.",
