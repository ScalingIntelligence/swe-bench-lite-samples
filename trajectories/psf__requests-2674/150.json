The user specifically mentions requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError. The task is to find the locations in the codebase where these exceptions are defined and potentially where they are propagated or handled specifically in the context of the requests library. Given the information provided, it's clear that these exceptions are derived from urllib3, but it's important to check how and where they intersect with the requests API.",

Specifically, the user is interested in knowing if requests should be hiding urllib3's exceptions and wrapping them in requests.exceptions types. They mention having to catch two specific exceptions: urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError.\n\nUpon analyzing the provided search results, I identified the following relevant code spans:\n\n1. In the `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py` file, the spans `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` are directly related to the exceptions mentioned in the issue.\n\n2. In the `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py` file, the spans `HTTPResponse._decode` and `HTTPResponse._init_decoder` are relevant as they handle the decoding of response content, which is where `DecodeError` could be raised.\n\n3. In the `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` file, the span `HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout` is relevant as it deals with raising `ReadTimeoutError`, which is a subclass of `TimeoutError`.\n\nThese code spans cover the handling of the specific exceptions (`DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`) and their integration within the requests library. This should provide a good understanding of how these exceptions are managed and propagated within the context of the requests API.",
