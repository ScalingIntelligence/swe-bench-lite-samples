Specifically, the user wants to ensure that urllib3's exceptions like DecodeError and TimeoutError are properly handled and not just hidden by requests. Based on the search results, it is clear that the urllib3 exceptions are defined in `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py`. The relevant exceptions mentioned (`DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`) are indeed defined there, alongside other related exceptions. Additionally, the `HTTPAdapter` class in `requests/adapters.py` imports and uses these exceptions, which indicates that they are part of the logic that adapters use to handle HTTP requests. This suggests that the exceptions are integrated into the requests library and not just hidden. The relevant code spans include the definitions of `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`, as well as the places where these exceptions are imported and potentially used in the context of handling HTTP requests. These details are crucial for understanding how exceptions are managed in the requests library and ensuring that any code catching these exceptions does so appropriately.",

They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n"
