The specific exceptions mentioned are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError. The current file context already provides the definitions for DecodeError and TimeoutError in the urllib3 exceptions file. The search results show several key parts of the requests library that might be relevant to understanding how these exceptions are handled or could be wrapped within requests exceptions:\n\n1. In the exceptions.py file, there are several exceptions defined that extend RequestException, which could potentially be used to wrap urllib3 exceptions.\n2. The adapters.py file contains the HTTPAdapter class, which has methods for sending requests and building responses. It specifically catches several exceptions from urllib3 and raises corresponding exceptions from the requests library. This is particularly relevant for understanding how urllib3 exceptions might pass through.\n3. The sessions.py file defines the Session class, which has methods for sending requests and handling responses. This also includes an implementation of the send method, which is where the HTTPAdapter's send method is called, indicating a potential point where urllib3 exceptions might propagate.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding how urllib3 exceptions are handled within the requests library and whether they are being appropriately wrapped or propagated. The identified spans include those from the exceptions.py, adapters.py, and sessions.py files.",
