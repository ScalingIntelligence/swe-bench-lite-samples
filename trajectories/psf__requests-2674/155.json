The issue suggests that these exceptions should be wrapped by requests' own exception types. The provided file context and search results indicate that the urllib3 exceptions module is being imported in the adapters.py file. Furthermore, the HTTPAdapter class in adapters.py appears to handle and reraise exceptions of various types, including urllib3's ProxyError, SSLError, and possibly TimeoutError. The send method in HTTPAdapter is particularly relevant as it captures and reraises exceptions from urllib3 as requests exceptions. Since the urllib3 exceptions are already being handled and re-wrapped within the HTTPAdapter class, this indicates that the current implementation aligns with the issue's requirement to wrap urllib3 exceptions with requests exceptions.",
