This suggests a potential problem in how the function processes permutations and possibly how it combines or merges solutions. Upon reviewing the search results, the most relevant sections appear to be those handling the solving of diophantine equations, specifically the 'diop_solve' and '_diop_linear' functions where the main logic for solving linear diophantine equations lies. These sections involve classifying the equation type, solving for the variables based on coefficients, and managing permutations of solutions. The 'merge_solution' function is also relevant as it combines different solutions which could be useful if the issue stems from how results are combined or presented.\n\nThe actual code spans that seem most pertinent to the issue are within the 'diop_solve' function where the equation type is handled, specifically the handling of 'linear' and possibly 'binary_quadratic' types. Additionally, the '_diop_linear' function that directly addresses linear diophantine equations might contain the source of the discrepancy based on symbol order. The 'merge_solution' function, while not directly related to solving equations, could influence how solutions are merged and reflected in the final results. Therefore, these three spans are identified as directly relevant to resolving the reported issue.",
