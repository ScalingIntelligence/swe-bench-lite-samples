The issue specifically points to discrepancies based on the order of symbols (syms=(m,n) vs syms=(n,m)) when permute=True. This suggests that the permutation handling within the diophantine function might not be correctly managing the symbol order across different permutations. The part of the code that appears most relevant is the handling of the 'permute' parameter within the 'diophantine' function (span id 'diophantine'), which includes logic for permuting the symbols and handling the order. Additionally, the function 'merge_solution' (span id 'merge_solution') that merges solutions to be returned might also play a role in how final solutions are structured and returned. The 'merge_solution' function could be implicated if the permutation of the solutions is not correctly handled regarding symbol order. There are no direct references in the identified spans to other parts of the codebase that might also be involved, so based on the current search results, the identified spans seem relevant to directly address the issue related to symbol order and permutation handling within the diophantine function.\n\nI have selected the span 'diophantine' and 'merge_solution' as these are directly responsible for handling permutations and merging solutions, which could be the root cause of the reported issue with symbol order and permutation handling when using permute=True. The 'diophantine' span contains the main logic where permutations are managed, and the 'merge_solution' span is where the final solutions are structured, potentially impacting how symbol order is maintained after permutation.",
