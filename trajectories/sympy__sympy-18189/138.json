This issue suggests a potential bug in how permutations and variable ordering are handled within the `diophantine` function. Looking at the search results, the `diophantine` span contains the main implementation of the `diophantine` function, which includes handling for the `syms` and `permute` parameters. This span includes logic to permute signs and handle variable orderings, which could be the source of the inconsistency observed in the reported issue. The code inside this span checks for permutations and adjusts the solution sets based on the `syms` order and permutation settings. The functionality within this span that deals with permutations and variable order (starting from the lines where `do_permute_signs`, `do_permute_signs_var`, `permute_few_signs` are determined and onwards) is particularly relevant because it directly affects how solutions are structured and returned. This is where the bug, if there is one, causing the discrepancy under the conditions described in the issue, might reside. Therefore, the identified code span within `diophantine` is relevant to the reported issue and should be further investigated to resolve the inconsistency.",
