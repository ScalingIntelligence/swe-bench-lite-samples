The issue demonstrates that the function does not consistently return all possible solutions based on the order of symbols. However, the provided context and search results indicate that there is already an existing implementation for the `diophantine` function in `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py`, which includes handling for the `permute=True` option. This implementation already includes logic to manage permutation of signs based on equation types and considers permutations of the solution set when `permute=True`. Despite this, the issue suggests that permutation is not always correctly influencing the outcome, indicating a potential oversight or bug in how permutations are applied or merged back into the final solution set. Since the existing code contains the primary logic for handling permutations and the main function itself, it appears that the necessary parts to address the issue are already within the span. However, the provided search results do not include any additional functions or logic that suggest an explicit oversight in the permutation logic within these spans. Further investigation would ideally involve a deep dive into the current permutation handling to ascertain where it might go wrong specifically for the reported issue.",
