The provided search results include a detailed implementation of the `diophantine` function, where the parameter `permute` is used to control the permutation of solutions. The analysis of the function shows that it handles different cases based on the type of equation and selectively applies permutations to the solutions. Specifically, the function sets flags like `do_permute_signs`, `permute_few_signs`, and `do_permute_signs_var` based on the type of equation, which determine whether to permute the signs of the variables or their values. This is a likely location where the inconsistency arises, as the permutations might not be applied uniformly across different symbol orders. Therefore, the relevant code spans are in the `diophantine` function where these flags are set and where permutations are applied to the solutions. Additionally, the `diop_solve` function also appears relevant as it delegates the solving process to different types of equation solvers.",
