The function should ensure that the results are consistent regardless of the order of symbols when 'permute=True'. The provided search results include the 'diophantine' function where the logic for handling 'syms' and 'permute' is implemented. It appears that the function attempts to adjust the results based on permutations of the signs of the solutions when certain conditions are met, as indicated by the variables 'do_permute_signs', 'do_permute_signs_var', and 'permute_few_signs'. This logic could be the source of the inconsistency observed in the reported issue.
