This suggests a potential bug in the permutation logic or the handling of symbol order within the `diophantine` function.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis of the current context and the search results, it is evident that the function `diophantine` is the central focus of the issue. This function is located within the file `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py`. The function's implementation includes various condition checks and logic to handle permutations, particularly when the `permute` parameter is set to `True`. This is clearly aligned with the issue at hand.\n\nThe identified code spans are crucial as they encapsulate the logic flow related to symbol permutation and order handling within the `diophantine` function. These spans will be instrumental in diagnosing and potentially rectifying the observed issue where results differ based on the order of `syms` when `permute=True`.",
