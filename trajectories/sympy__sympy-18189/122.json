The issue indicates that the function is not providing consistent results for different orders of `syms`. This suggests a potential problem in how the function handles permutations. The relevant code spans identified are the `diophantine` function and its internal logic, particularly where it processes the `syms` argument and the `permute` flag. Understanding how the function integrates permutations and handles the `syms` argument will be crucial for addressing the reported issue. Additionally, the function `diop_solve` and its associated methods are also relevant as they are the backbone for solving specific types of diophantine equations. Reviewing the `diophantine` function and its interaction with `permute` and `syms` is essential to identify where the inconsistency might be occurring.",
