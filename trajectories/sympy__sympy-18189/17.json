The search results include the `diophantine` function definition within the `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` file, which is directly relevant to the issue. The function handles permutations of the `syms` parameter and includes logic for permuting signs when certain conditions are met, which aligns with the observed behavior in the issue. The analysis of the code reveals that the permutation logic appears to be correctly implemented for the type of equations reported in the issue; however, the results suggest that the implementation may not handle all permutations correctly. This review indicates that the `diophantine` function is the relevant code span that directly addresses the reported issue. Specifically, the permutation logic involving `syms` and `permute` in the `diophantine` function should be further inspected to identify the potential cause of the incomplete results.",
