The issue is clearly demonstrating that the function's output varies based on the order of symbols, which is not expected behavior for a function that is meant to be permutation-invariant. Given this information, I looked into the code section where the `diophantine` function is defined and implemented to find any relevant code spans that could be related to the handling of symbol permutations and the generation of solutions. I found that the `diophantine` function itself contains the logic where permutations are controlled by the `permute` parameter. Other spans related to `diophantine`, such as helper functions like `is_solution_quad` and permutation utilities imported from `sympy.utilities.iterables`, also appear relevant as they may support the main functionality of `diophantine` concerning permutations and solution validation.",

This suggests that there might be an issue with how permutations are handled within the function.\n\nReviewing the provided code, I see that the `diophantine` function in `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` contains logic for handling permutations and signed permutations when `permute=True`. Specifically, it uses the `permute_signs` and `signed_permutations` functions from `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`.\n\nGiven the issue description, it's reasonable to assume that the bug might be related to how these permutations are processed or applied within the `diophantine` function. To confirm, I would need to see more of the implementation details, especially around the part where permutations are being generated and used.\n\nHowever, based on the current context, the most relevant code spans seem to be those dealing directly with permutation logic in both files.
