The examples provided show that the output varies based on the order of the symbols, suggesting a potential problem with how the permutations are handled or how the results are filtered based on the input order. The search results include several relevant spans, notably the 'diophantine' function itself and its internal handling of permutations and symbol order. These spans show the function's main logic and how it deals with permutations, which directly relates to the issue described. The '_sorted_tuple' function might also be relevant as it could affect how the symbols are ordered and thus affect the results. Additionally, the 'diop_solve' and '_diop_linear' functions are included as they handle the underlying solving logic, which is key to understanding any discrepancies in results. The identified code spans should provide a good starting point for addressing the issue by examining how symbol permutations influence the outcome of the diophantine function.",
