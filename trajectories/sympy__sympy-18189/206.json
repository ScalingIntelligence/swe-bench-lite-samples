Given that the current context does not identify any relevant code, I will focus on the provided search results to find any code spans that deal specifically with permutations and syms order handling.\n\nThe key elements to look for in the code spans are:\n1. Code that deals with the `permute` parameter.\n2. Code that processes the `syms` parameter.\n3. Code that checks or permutes the order of variables.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided code spans, I identify the following relevant spans:\n1. The span with id 'imports' contains basic imports, which could be related but don't directly address the issue.\n2. The span with id 'diophantine' contains the definition of the `diophantine` function and its handling of the `permute` parameter and the `syms` parameter. It includes logic that checks if permutation is needed and how to handle the permutation of signs and variables.\n3. The span with id 'merge_solution' and 'diop_solve' do not directly address the permutation issue but are involved in the general solving process, which might be peripherally relevant.\n\nFrom the analysis, the 'diophantine' span is the most relevant as it directly pertains to the function in question and contains the specific logic around handling the `permute` parameter and the `syms` order. Therefore, this span should be identified as relevant to the reported issue.\n",
