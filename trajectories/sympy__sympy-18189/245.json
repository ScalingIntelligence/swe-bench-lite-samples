Specifically, the results vary depending on whether `syms=(m,n)` or `syms=(n,m)`. This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the codebase. Reviewing the current file context, it is clear that the `diophantine` function is where the issue lies. The `diophantine` function processes the equation and handles permutation logic within it. The new search results confirm this, showing the `diophantine` function and additional utility functions from `sympy.utilities.iterables` that handle permutations and signed permutations. These utility functions, `permute_signs` and `signed_permutations`, are likely used within the `diophantine` function to generate the permutations needed when `permute=True`. Given this analysis, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of where the issue might be addressed and how permutation handling is implemented within SymPy's `diophantine` solver.",
