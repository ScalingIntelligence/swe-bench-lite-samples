The issue specifically deals with the function's behavior in permuting the solutions based on the order of symbols. After analyzing the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are within the `diophantine` function itself. The function handles the `permute` parameter differently for various types of equations. By examining the code, it's evident that the permutation logic includes checks for different equation types to determine if sign permutations are allowed. This directly relates to the observed issue where the order of `syms` impacts the results when `permute=True`. The code also involves specific handling for permutation of signs, which could explain the discrepancy in results based on the order of symbols.",
