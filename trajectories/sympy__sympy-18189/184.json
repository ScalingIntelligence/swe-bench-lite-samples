The provided search results contain the `diophantine` function definition and related helper functions. The function `diophantine` handles the permutation of symbols and signs, which directly addresses the issue of permuting the order of symbols. The key section of the code that needs to be examined is where the `permute` parameter is used to decide how the solutions are permuted based on the type of equation. However, it appears that the implementation might not be handling all cases consistently, leading to the observed behavior. The relevant code spans include the entire `diophantine` function, particularly the part where permutations are managed (marked with `permute` in the code).",
