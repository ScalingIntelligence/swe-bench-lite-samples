The `diophantine` span also has logic to check if permutation is enabled and to adjust the solution accordingly. The `merge_solution` span is a helper function used within `diophantine` to merge solutions with the original variables. The `diop_solve` span is another helper function that solves a classified Diophantine equation type. The issue reported seems directly related to the `diophantine` function, specifically how it handles permutations and possibly how it merges solutions.

The function `diophantine` contains logic for handling permutations of signs and variables when 'permute=True', as indicated by the parameters 'do_permute_signs', 'do_permute_signs_var', and 'permute_few_signs'. This logic suggests that the function tries to account for permutation effects but may not be handling all cases correctly, leading to inconsistent results.
