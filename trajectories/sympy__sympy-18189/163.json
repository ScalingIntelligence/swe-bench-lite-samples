The issue is demonstrated by two function calls where the order of `syms` is reversed. While examining the `diophantine` function definition in the `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` file, it becomes evident that there is a complex handling of permutation and sign manipulations based on the type of equation and the configuration of `permute`. The function attempts to address permutation logic for certain types of equations like 'general_sum_of_squares' and 'general_sum_of_even_powers', as well as for specific quadratic forms. Given that the issue involves permutation with respect to the order of symbols, it is critical to scrutinize the handling of `syms` inside the `diophantine` function, particularly where permutation is checked and applied. Given this context, the identified relevant span in the `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` is the 'diophantine' function span, as it directly controls how permutation and symbol order are managed. This span should be further analyzed and possibly refactored to ensure that the permutation logic correctly handles different orders of 'syms', thus resolving the inconsistency observed in the reported issue.",
