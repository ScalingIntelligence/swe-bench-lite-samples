The provided search results contain significant code spans that could be relevant to addressing this issue, particularly because they relate to the implementation and handling of permutations within the `diophantine` function. The function definition for `diophantine` contains logic for handling permutations, specifically with the `permute` parameter in conjunction with the `var` and `syms` arguments. This function potentially directly addresses the issue by orchestrating permutation logic to ensure completeness of results despite variations in symbol order. Furthermore, the `merge_solution` function, though not directly apparent in relevance based on the issue description, could be peripherally related as it appears to process and standardize solution sets which may benefit or require permutation handling within its implementation. The `diop_solve` function's relevance, not directly evident from the issue but crucial because it's a concrete solver for particular types of diophantine equations, supports the suggested need for testing all possible outcomes which could implement additional permutation handling cases not detailed in the issue but essential for thorough outcomes in any redesign considering a solution involving the code spans listed.",

These functions handle permutation and sign variations well, suggesting that the issue might not be directly within these methods, but rather in how these permutation sets are used or combined in the broader algorithm. Since the problem involves permutation and the order of symbols impacting results, it suggests the need for a more comprehensive check in the integration or interpretation of the permuted solutions returned by these methods. Given this, it is plausible that the issue arises from how the solutions are merged or assessed after permutation, rather than in the permutation logic itself. For now, given the context, no changes seem necessary directly in the code spans provided, as they appear to correctly manage permutations.",
