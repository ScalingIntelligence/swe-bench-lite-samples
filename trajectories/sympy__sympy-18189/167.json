Specifically, the provided example shows that the function returns different sets of solutions for the same equation but with different orders of the symbols `n` and `m`. This indicates a potential issue in how the function handles the permutation of symbols and the generation of results. The provided code spans include the `diop_solve` function, which is central to solving Diophantine equations, and sub-functions such as `_diop_linear` and `_diop_quadratic`, which handle specific types of Diophantine equations. These functions are relevant as they directly deal with solving equations and could potentially contain the logic that affects the permutation handling, which is the core issue identified. The code spans also include import statements and other utility functions, which are contextually important for understanding the environment in which the main functions operate. Given the issue description and the nature of the code spans provided, these are the most relevant code spans to address the reported issue regarding permutation handling in the `diophantine` function.",

The analysis indicates that the issue might be related to how the function handles permutations and the order of symbols. The search results include relevant code spans such as the `diop_linear` and `diop_quadratic` functions, which deal with linear and quadratic Diophantine equations respectively. These functions are likely to be involved in handling the permutations and thus could be the source of the discrepancy. The `diophantine` function itself is also included, which orchestrates the solving process, potentially pointing to where the permutation logic is applied. Given the report, it is plausible that the logic within these functions fails to correctly handle all permutations when `permute=True`, leading to incomplete results.",
