Specifically, ensure that the solutions generated are not dependent on the order of symbols by making the permutation and sign handling logic invariant to the order of symbols.\n\nThe initial response was incorrect as it failed to provide specific line numbers for the update and included a rejection without the necessity for such action. Since the request demands a specific change to handle permutations and sign changes in a way that makes them order-independent, focus should be on lines dealing explicitly with these operations. Refining the selection to a more precise range, the logic for permutation and sign handling is concentrated within the section that checks and applies permutations based on conditions starting at line 218 and continuing up to line 348. However, applying a more granular approach, the essential update lies in the conditional blocks starting from line 336 to 347, where the permutation functions are directly applied. Therefore, this specific range should be modified to ensure that the permutations and sign handling logic does not depend on the order of symbols.",
