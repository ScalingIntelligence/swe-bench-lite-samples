Upon examining the provided search results, the 'diophantine' function and related methods are found in the 'sympy/solvers/diophantine.py' file. Specifically, the 'diop_solve' function, '_diop_quadratic', and '_diop_general_pythagorean' functions appear to be directly related to the issue, as they handle the solving of diophantine equations, including different types such as linear, quadratic, and general pythagorean. The '_diop_quadratic' function in particular seems especially relevant as it deals with binary quadratic equations, which could potentially include permutations of variables that might affect the output based on the symbol order. The code spans identified ('diop_solve', '_diop_quadratic', and '_diop_general_pythagorean') are marked for further examination to confirm if they indeed contain the logic that needs to be adjusted or inspected to address the reported issue of incomplete results with permuted symbol orders.",
