This issue should be addressed in the `diophantine` function located in the `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` file. The provided search results contain this function, and we should focus on the sections that handle permutation logic, particularly those initializing permutation flags and those processing permutation steps in the solution generation to ensure all permutations are considered correctly regardless of the order of `syms`.\n\nUpon reviewing the `diophantine` function, I observe that the method defines permutation flags like `do_permute_signs`, `do_permute_signs_var`, and `permute_few_signs`, which are critical for handling permutations correctly based on the type of equation. It also contains control logic to generate permutations using `signed_permutations` depending on the `eq_type` and conditions like having even powers in equations. These are the sections of code most relevant to the reported issue as they directly impact the output permutations.\n\nTo address the reported issue, these sections should be inspected and possibly adjusted to ensure that permutations are applied uniformly regardless of the order of `syms`. Since the issue specifically mentions different results for different orders of `syms` with `permute=True`, it is essential to ensure that all permutations are correctly accounted for and not dependent on the initial order of input symbols.",
