The issue shows that the function returns different results depending on the order of the symbols in 'syms'. This discrepancy needs to be addressed to ensure consistent and complete solutions.\n\nFrom the search results, both 'diophantine' and 'diop_solve' functions are relevant. The 'diophantine' function processes the equation and handles the 'permute' option, while the 'diop_solve' function determines the specific type of diophantine equation and solves it accordingly. It's important to focus on how permutations are handled within the 'diophantine' function to ensure that all possible permutations are considered correctly.\n\nBased on the code analysis, the 'diophantine' function processes permutations under specific conditions related to the types of equations (e.g., 'general_sum_of_squares', 'homogeneous_ternary_quadratic'). These sections of the code need to be carefully reviewed to ensure that permutations are correctly propagated and considered throughout the solving process, especially for different orders of 'syms'.",
