I analyzed the provided code spans in `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` which include the definition of the `diophantine` function and related helper functions like `classify_diop` and `diop_solve`. These functions handle the classification and solving of diophantine equations. The `diophantine` function processes the equation, identifies the type of diophantine equation, and solves it using different approaches based on the type. A key element of the reported issue is related to how permutation of signs is handled in the solution. The relevant section checks conditions to determine if permutation of signs applies (do_permute_signs, permute_few_signs) and if so, it applies permutations of the solutions appropriately. This behavior seems central to the issue as it controls how solutions are extended or modified based on the permutations of signs. Based on the detailed analysis of the function and the issue's context, it indicates that the 'diophantine' and its interaction with 'classify_diop' and 'diop_solve' are highly relevant. This relevance is especially evident in how permutation of solutions is managed, encompassing both the handling of permutations when `permute=True` and the underlying logic and conditions affecting it.",
