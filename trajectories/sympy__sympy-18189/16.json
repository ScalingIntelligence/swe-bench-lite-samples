Specifically, the issue is demonstrated with two examples where the results differ based on the order of `syms`. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the `diophantine` function's handling of `syms` and `permute` parameters. The search results reveal the relevant code span (`diophantine`) where these parameters are processed. This span includes logic to handle permuting of signs and permutations of the solution set based on the `permute` flag. Understanding and potentially modifying this section to ensure consistent results regardless of the order of `syms` is essential. Given the detailed nature of the code analysis, especially around how permutations are computed and applied, this span appears to be directly relevant to addressing the issue.",
