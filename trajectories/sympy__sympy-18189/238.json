The issue describes inconsistent results based on the order of symbols in the `syms` parameter. In the provided code span `diophantine`, a significant logic flow is observed, which might be handling the `permute` parameter and its interaction with the `syms` parameter. Examining this span would be crucial to identify the root cause of the inconsistency in the output based on the order of symbols. Since no prior relevant code has been identified, we should focus on this span for the initial investigation. Additionally, given the in-depth logic surrounding permutation and handling of symbol parameters within the `diophantine` function, diving into the implementation details here should directly address the user-reported issue regarding permutation and symbol ordering.",
