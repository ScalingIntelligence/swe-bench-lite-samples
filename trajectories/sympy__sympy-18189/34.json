This discrepancy is observed in the solutions for the same equation but with different symbol orders. The analysis of the code spans provided in 'diophantine' and 'diop_solve' functions reveals that the 'diophantine' function is responsible for handling the main logic of the diophantine equation solver, including the permutation of symbols when 'permute=True'. The function 'permute_signs' and 'signed_permutations' are used for permuting the signs and permutations of solutions. The issue seems to be related to how these permutations are applied or how the solutions are merged back into the original symbol order. The 'diop_solve' function is responsible for solving specific types of diophantine equations and returns solutions which are then processed by 'diophantine'.",
