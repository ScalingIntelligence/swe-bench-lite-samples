This suggests a problem with how permutations are handled within the diophantine function. By examining the code spans in sympy/solvers/diophantine.py, specifically the 'diophantine' code span, it is observed that the function includes logic to handle permutations based on the type of equation. The code checks if the 'permute' flag is set to True and then permutes the signs or the variables as needed. The issue might be arising because the permutations are not exhaustive or not correctly applied for certain orders of syms. Marking the 'diophantine' code span as relevant will allow further investigation into the permutation logic and how it interacts with the order of syms.",
