The issue notes that the results are incomplete if the order of symbols is changed. The key part of the code to examine is the 'diophantine' function itself, which is responsible for handling the permutations and solving the diophantine equations. The provided code spans include the 'diophantine' function and the helper function 'diop_solve'. Both of these functions are directly related to the reported issue as they handle the main logic of diophantine equation solving and permutation. The 'diophantine' function contains the logic for handling permutations based on the 'permute' parameter and the order of symbols provided. This function needs to be inspected to ensure that the permutations are handled correctly regardless of the order of symbols. The 'diop_solve' function is also relevant as it is called within 'diophantine' to solve specific types of diophantine equations, which could also be affected by the order of symbols and the permutation logic. Therefore, both spans are relevant to the reported issue.",
