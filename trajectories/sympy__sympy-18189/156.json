This can be addressed by ensuring that all permutations are generated irrespective of the order of symbols. However, no changes are needed in the sympy/solvers/diophantine.py file regardign this problem.Code span focus on `diophantine` function is the place to focus to solve the issue reported butthe findings do not initiate changes to the diophantine function based on the reviewed issue, therefore no changes regarding issue solved in sympy/solvers/diophantine.py file.I plan to make a change in the sympy/utilities/iterables.py file, specifically in the `signed_permutations` and `permute_signs` functions to ensure more thorough permutation of signed values.",
