The key elements to focus on are the 'diophantine' function definition, which handles the main logic of solving these equations, and any related functions or utilities that may affect the permutation and order of symbols. Specifically, the `diophantine` function span should be analyzed to understand how permutation and symbol order are handled, as well as other helper functions like `_sorted_tuple` and `_rational_pq` that could influence this behavior. The analysis should focus on how permutations of symbols are generated and applied within the `diophantine` function to ensure all relevant combinations are considered.
