Specifically, the results vary depending on the order of symbols provided, which indicates a potential flaw in the way permutations and order handling are implemented within the function. Given the search results, the most relevant code spans are those related to the `diophantine` function itself, particularly where permutations and the order of symbols are processed. The `diophantine` span contains the main logic of the function, including the handling of the `permute` parameter and the logic for processing symbolic inputs. This span is crucial for understanding and addressing the issue related to permutation and symbol order handling. Additionally, the `merge_solution` span is identified as potentially relevant because it deals with merging and handling solutions, which is related to how results from different orders of symbols might be combined or interpreted. These two spans collectively cover key parts of the codebase that are likely to contain the root cause of the observed inconsistencies.",
