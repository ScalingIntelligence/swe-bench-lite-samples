This inconsistency suggests that the function may not be consistently permuting solutions when the order of symbols changes. To address this, it is crucial to identify the specific part of the 'diophantine' function where the permutation logic is applied based on the 'syms' order. From the provided search results, two primary spans are relevant: the 'diophantine' function definition and the 'diop_solve' function. The 'diophantine' function contains the logic for handling the 'permute' parameter and its interaction with the 'syms' order. The 'diop_solve' function could also be indirectly related if it is involved in the solution process affected by the permutation logic in 'diophantine'. Therefore, these two spans are identified as relevant to the issue.",
