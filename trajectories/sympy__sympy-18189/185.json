The primary areas of concern identified in the issue are the handling of symbol permutations and the computation of solutions in different orders. The search results provide the diophantine function and related methods, particularly focusing on the handling of permutations and merging of solutions. The `diophantine` span covers the main function and its logic for handling permutations, which directly relates to the issue's concern with inconsistent results due to symbol order permutations. The `merge_solution` span is also relevant as it merges solutions, potentially affecting how different permutations are handled. The `_diop_linear` span is less directly relevant, but it's part of the broader code context for solving linear Diophantine equations, which may provide additional context or helper functions used within the diophantine function. Thus, the identified code spans are crucial for addressing the issue related to symbol order and permutation handling.",

The existing code already contains the 'diophantine' function with logic to handle permutation of symbols, as indicated by the 'do_permute_signs', 'do_permute_signs_var', and 'permute_few_signs' variables. Additionally, the search results include auxiliary functions such as '_is_int', '_sorted_tuple', '_remove_gcd', '_rational_pq', '_nint_or_floor', '_odd', '_even', 'divisible', 'is_solution_quad', and 'power_representation'. These functions provide utilities for integer checks, tuple sorting, gcd removal, rational number computations, integer division, parity checks, divisibility checks, solution validation, and power representation respectively, which could be relevant for further refining the 'diophantine' function or its subroutines. Given the current context, extending the permutation logic in the 'diophantine' function, particularly around the handling of 'permute=True', might address the issue reported. Additionally, ensuring comprehensive checks in the underlying functions around integer validity, solution correctness, and parameter handling could further stabilize the functionality.",
