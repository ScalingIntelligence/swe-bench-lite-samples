These functions are relevant because they handle the classification, solving, and merging of solutions for diophantine equations, which is directly related to the reported issue. The specific code spans that are relevant include the 'diophantine' function definition, especially the part that handles symbol permutation and solution generation, and the 'classify_diop' function that identifies the type of diophantine equation. The 'merge_solution' and 'diop_solve' functions also play crucial roles in managing and solving diophantine equations, making them relevant to the issue.
