The example provided shows that different results are obtained when `syms=(m,n)` versus `syms=(n,m)`. This suggests that the permutation logic within the `diophantine` function may not be handling the permutations correctly, particularly when determining the final solution set. The code spans identified in the search results include the `diophantine` function itself, as well as several auxiliary functions. These functions are responsible for handling permutations (`permute_signs`, `signed_permutations`), solving diophantine equations of various types, and classifying the type of equation. These functions are directly relevant to the issue reported as they are involved in the core logic of the `diophantine` function. Therefore, these code spans should be analyzed in detail to understand how permutations are handled and how the final solution set is determined.",
