This issue suggests that there might be a problem with how permutations are handled in the code. Upon inspection of the `diophantine` function in the search results, it appears that the function contains logic to handle permutations of signs and variables when `permute=True`. The code section labeled 'diophantine' contains the relevant logic for permuting signs and handling the `permute` parameter. Specifically, the function checks the type of the equation and whether to permute signs based on the equation type. Since the issue involves permutations and the results depending on the order of `syms`, this code span is highly relevant to addressing the issue. The 'diophantine' span contains the logic that needs to be examined and possibly corrected to ensure that permutations are handled correctly regardless of the order of `syms`.",
