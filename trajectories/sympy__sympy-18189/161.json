The issue demonstrates that changing the order of symbols (m, n) to (n, m) yields inconsistent solutions. The search results provide the implementation of the 'diophantine' function in the 'sympy/solvers/diophantine.py' file. This function is likely responsible for handling the diophantine calculations, which is directly related to the reported issue. Inside this function, there is logic for permuting the signs of solutions based on the type of equation. This is particularly relevant to the issue since it involves permutation. Additionally, the 'merge_solution' function is also identified as relevant, as it handles the merging of solutions with the variables involved in the equation. This might affect how the solutions are presented based on the order of symbols. The 'diop_solve' function is also relevant as it directly addresses the solving of diophantine equations, which is the core functionality under scrutiny. Considering this, these code spans are likely to be the ones dealing with the inconsistencies reported in the issue.",
