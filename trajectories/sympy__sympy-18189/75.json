This suggests that the function's behavior might be influenced by the order of the symbols, which could indicate a problem in how permutations are handled or how results are collected and returned. By examining the relevant code spans in the search results, particularly those involving the diophantine function and its handling of permutations and symbol order, we can identify the parts of the code that are likely involved in the issue. The identified spans include the diophantine function itself and its internal workings, such as the handling of permutations and the classification and solving of diophantine equations. This includes the classify_diop function, which determines the type of the equation, and the diop_solve function, which solves the equation based on its type. Additionally, the _diop_linear and _diop_quadratic functions are relevant as they handle specific types of diophantine equations that might be involved in the issue due to their handling of coefficients and variables. These spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue related to the order of symbols and permutation handling.",
