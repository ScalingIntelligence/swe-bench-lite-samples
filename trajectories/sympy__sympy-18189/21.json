This suggests that the handling of permutations and the order of symbols in the function might be the root cause. The search results provide the `diophantine` function definition and the `diop_solve` function which is likely used within `diophantine`. Analyzing the code, the `diophantine` function processes the equation and checks the `permute` parameter to determine whether to permute the signs or variables. This is highly relevant to the reported issue as it directly involves the permutation logic and symbol order handling. Therefore, the identified code spans should focus on the `diophantine` function where the `permute` parameter is managed and where symbol order is processed.",
