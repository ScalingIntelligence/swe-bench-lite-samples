The issue is demonstrated by two examples showing different outputs for the same equation using different orders of symbols. This suggests that the internal logic for handling permutations might not be correctly implemented or there might be an issue with how the results are processed to account for all permutations of the symbols.\n\nThe provided code spans include both the function definition (`diophantine`) and a closely related function (`diop_solve`). It is crucial to note that understanding the logic within `diophantine` is essential, particularly how it handles permutations of symbols when `permute=True`. The code checks for certain equation types and conditions under which permutations should be applied to the solutions, but it seems to have specific rules and exceptions that likely lead to the observed behavior. This warrants a detailed examination of the sections within `diophantine` that handle permutations and potentially also the helper functions it calls.\n\nGiven the symptoms described, a first step would be to see if there are conditions that exclusively trigger for one order of symbols compared to the other. This might involve logical flaws in the permutation handling or incorrect assumptions made during the algorithmic steps related to permutation. Identifying and focusing on these areas can help debug why results are order-dependent in the reported examples.",
