This suggests that the permutation logic might have flaws or the order of symbols might not be correctly respected in the calculations. The search results include the implementation of the diophantine function, which is likely the starting point for addressing the issue. Additionally, there is a related function diop_solve which could also potentially affect the permutation behavior. Both are key to understanding and reproducing the reported issue.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, the central focus is on the diophantine function where permutation logic is handled. The function includes import statements, definition of the diophantine function, and the implementation of how it handles permutation. The code spans labeled 'diophantine' and 'diop_solve' contain the relevant parts of the code that are directly related to the issue, particularly where the permute parameter is considered within the diophantine function and the various cases it handles to determine when to permute signs. This analysis indicates that the 'diophantine' span is the primary area of interest, as it directly encompasses the identified issue concerning permutation and the order of symbols.",
