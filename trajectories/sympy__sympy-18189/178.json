Specifically, the `diophantine` function in the search results defines how permutations of symbols are handled, which is core to the issue. Additional helper functions like `_diop_linear` and `_diop_quadratic` are likely related to solving particular types of diophantine equations, which could influence the behavior of `diophantine` when `permute=True`. Reviewing these functions is essential to understand if they properly handle symbol permutations and if they need adjustments to ensure consistency across different symbol orders.",
