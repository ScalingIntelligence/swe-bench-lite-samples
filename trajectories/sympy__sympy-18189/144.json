The code spans provided include the `diophantine` function definition and several helper functions. The `diophantine` function processes the equation and handles permutations based on the type of equation. Specifically, it checks if permutations should be applied based on the type of equation (e.g., 'general_sum_of_squares', 'homogeneous_ternary_quadratic', etc.). The behavior of permutations is determined within the function, particularly where it sets `do_permute_signs`, `do_permute_signs_var`, and `permute_few_signs` flags. These flags control whether to apply permutations to the signs of the solutions or the variables themselves. Given the issue description, the relevant code spans are the ones that handle these permutations within the `diophantine` function.",
