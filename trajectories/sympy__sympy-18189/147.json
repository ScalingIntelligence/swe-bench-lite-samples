The issue is that the results depend on the order of the symbols provided in the 'syms' parameter. Specifically, different orders of 'syms' yield different sets of solutions. The search results provide the implementation of the 'diophantine' function, which includes handling for the 'permute=True' parameter. The code includes logic for permuting signs and variables based on the type of equation, which is relevant to addressing the reported issue. The 'diophantine' function is particularly relevant as it directly addresses the reported issue by handling permutations and ensuring all possible solutions are considered. Additionally, the 'diop_solve' function is identified as relevant because it is called within the 'diophantine' function to solve specific types of diophantine equations, which may also play a role in the incomplete results depending on the order of 'syms'.",
