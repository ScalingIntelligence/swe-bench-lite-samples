The 'diophantine' function definition (span id='diophantine') which processes the equation, determines the type of Diophantine equation, and computes the solutions. This function includes logic to handle permutations, which is directly relevant to the reported issue.\n\n2.

While not directly related to the issue of permutation, understanding how solutions are merged can provide context on how the system handles different permutations of solutions.\n\nBased on these analyses, the identified code spans seem relevant to investigate and potentially resolve the reported problem of inconsistent results due to the order of symbols with 'permute=True'.",
