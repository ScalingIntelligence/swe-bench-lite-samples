This suggests that the permutation logic within the `diophantine` function might not be handling all permutations correctly, leading to inconsistent results based on the order of variables. The search results include the `diophantine` function definition, which contains the logic for permutation handling. Specifically, there are checks and actions related to permuting signs of solutions when certain conditions are met. This code should be examined to ensure that it correctly handles all permutations and signs as intended. The `diop_solve` function is also present, which might be responsible for solving different types of equations, potentially involving permutations. Given the reported issue, it's crucial to ensure that the permutation logic in both `diophantine` and `diop_solve` (if relevant) is comprehensive and not order-dependent.",
