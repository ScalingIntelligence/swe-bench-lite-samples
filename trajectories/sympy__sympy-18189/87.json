The relevant sections to investigate further are the handling of `permute=True` within the `diophantine` function and the logic that controls the permutation of solutions based on equation types. Specifically, the code block within the `diophantine` function where `permute=True` is handled, and the conditions that dictate whether to permute signs of solutions, should be examined. The classification and handling of different types of equations might also play a crucial role in this issue, as indicated by the `classify_diop` function and the subsequent actions taken based on the equation type.",
