Specifically, the results differ based on whether syms=(m,n) or syms=(n,m). The file context already points to the 'diophantine' function in 'sympy/solvers/diophantine.py', which is a key location for this issue. Analyzing the search results, especially the 'diophantine' function, reveals that the functionality for handling the permute argument and the logic for permuting the signs or variables within the solutions are present. The 'permute=True' case triggers conditions that determine whether to use 'permute_signs' or 'signed_permutations'. The issue might be related to how these permutations are managed or how the solutions are merged and filtered. Additionally, there are other permutation-related utilities and classes in other files, but for the purpose of addressing this specific issue, the focus should remain on 'sympy/solvers/diophantine.py'. The investigation should ensure that all permutations are correctly applied and that the solutions are appropriately filtered and merged, maintaining consistency regardless of the order of symbols.",
