This suggests a problem with how permutations are handled in the function. The search results show two code spans in the `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` file: one for the function `diophantine` itself and another for the function `diop_solve`. The `diophantine` function includes logic for handling permutations of symbols and signs, which is likely where the issue lies. Specifically, the code block inside `diophantine` that deals with permutation flags (`do_permute_signs`, `do_permute_signs_var`, `permute_few_signs`) and their conditions seems relevant to the reported issue. The `diop_solve` function is also relevant as it is responsible for solving specific types of Diophantine equations, which is ultimately what `diophantine` relies on to produce results. These spans provide a good starting point to investigate and address the reported issue.",
