This issue suggests that the function may not be correctly handling permutations and the order of symbols. The main focus should be on the `diophantine` function and its handling of the `syms` parameter and permutation logic. The provided code spans include the `diophantine` function, which is directly related to the issue. The function processes the equation, checks for permutations, and calculates solutions. It's essential to review the logic related to permutations and symbol order in the `diophantine` function to understand why different orders of symbols produce different results and how the permutation logic affects these results. It's a complex function dealing with mathematical equations and permutations, so a detailed examination is crucial to identify the specific lines affecting the outcome's completeness based on symbol order and permutation settings.",
