The provided search results include the `diophantine` function and related imports. The function's logic involving the `permute` parameter and the handling of different cases based on the equation type seem to be relevant to the reported issue. The function attempts to permute solutions based on the equation type and the presence of specific coefficients, which could be a source of the discrepancy observed in the issue.
