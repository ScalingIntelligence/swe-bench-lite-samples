This suggests an issue in how permutations are handled in the function. Analyzing the search results, the 'diophantine' function and its handling of permutations are specifically relevant. The function checks if 'permute' is True and decides on how to handle permutations based on the type of equation and the presence of even powers of variables. This aligns with the reported issue, where different orders of symbols lead to varying results, indicating a problem in permutation handling. The 'diophantine' function also has a significant block dedicated to permutation handling, which precisely tackles the problem described. The 'diop_solve' function is also briefly touched upon as it contains internal functions that may aid in solving the underlying issues, though it doesn't directly pertain to the permutation issue.",
