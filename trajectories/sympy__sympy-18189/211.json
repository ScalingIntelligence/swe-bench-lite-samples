This discrepancy in results is observed when the symbols are permuted. The search results provide two key parts of the code: the imports and the implementation of the diophantine function. The imports are standard for the module and do not directly address the issue. The diophantine function, however, contains logic that could be relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue related to permutation and symbol order. Specifically, the function processes the equation and the symbols, and there are sections that handle permutation logic based on the type of equation. This includes checks for certain equation types and the variable lengths when permute=True. These sections could be the source of the discrepancy observed in the reported issue. Thus, further investigation should focus on these parts of the code to determine why the results are inconsistent depending on symbol order when permute=True.",

This suggests a potential problem with how permutations of solutions are handled within the function. Upon examining the code, it is evident that the function `diophantine` does indeed handle permutations of solutions based on certain conditions, particularly focusing on the variables' powers and coefficients. The issue could arise from how these conditions are evaluated or how the permutations are applied. The provided search results include the entire implementation of `diophantine` and `diop_solve`, which are central to understanding and resolving the reported issue.
