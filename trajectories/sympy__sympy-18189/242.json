Given this, the most relevant spans of code are those within the 'diophantine' function definition itself, as well as the logic that checks if permutations should be performed and how the permutations are handled. The search results provided include two spans: 'imports' which is less relevant as it only includes import statements, and 'diophantine' which is highly relevant as it contains the function definition and the logic that directly relates to the reported issue. There is no 'diop_solve' span given in the search results, but based on the context, it's likely part of the broader solution in solving diophantine equations and could be relevant in understanding the broader context of permutation handling.",
