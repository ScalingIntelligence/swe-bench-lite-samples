The search results include the `diophantine` function and the `diop_solve` function, both of which are likely relevant to this issue. The `diophantine` function is particularly significant because it contains the permutation logic and handles the `permute` parameter. The `diop_solve` function is also important because it is used within `diophantine` to find solutions based on the type of equation, and the incomplete results could be due to how solutions are handled or returned in these functions. Both of these spans are necessary to fully address the issue of incomplete results based on symbol order with `permute=True`. Additionally, the import statements and other related functions could be relevant for a full understanding, but for now, focusing on the relevant parts of `diophantine` and `diop_solve` appears to be sufficient to tackle the reported problem directly.",

The issue specifically points out that the order of symbols in `syms` affects the outcome when permutation is enabled. This suggests a problem in how permutations are handled within the `diophantine` function, particularly with respect to the `permute_signs` and `signed_permutations` functions.\n\nThe `diophantine` function is already identified in the file context, and further examination of the new search results shows relevant spans such as `diop_solve`, `_is_int`, and `power_representation`. These spans might contain parts of the logic used in the `diophantine` function, particularly the `signed_permutations` function which is directly related to the permutation logic.\n\nGiven this context and the reported issue, it's crucial to further investigate these spans to validate their implementation and determine whether they contribute or resolve the issue of incomplete results with `permute=True`.",
