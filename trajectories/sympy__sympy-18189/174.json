This suggests a need to examine the code where the 'diophantine' function handles the 'syms' parameter and the permutations logic, particularly how it checks for specific types of equations and how it processes the list of variables and their coefficients. Given this, the relevant code spans identified are those from the 'imports' section where necessary functions and libraries are imported, and the 'diophantine' and 'diop_solve' spans which contain the core logic of the function. It is crucial to analyze both 'diophantine' and 'diop_solve' to understand how permutations are handled and to verify if the permutations are correctly applied regardless of the order of symbols in 'syms'.",
