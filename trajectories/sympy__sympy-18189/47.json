This behavior suggests that the function may not be properly handling permutations of solutions based on the order of symbols. Analyzing the `diophantine` function, we observe that it contains logic for handling permutations when `permute=True`, but it seems there might be a bug or incomplete logic in how permutations are being generated and applied based on the symbol order. The relevant code spans include the main `diophantine` function definition, as well as internal logic for handling permutations and merging solutions. These sections of code should be carefully reviewed and debugged to ensure correct handling of permutations based on the order of symbols. Specifically, the code needs to ensure that all permutations of solutions are correctly generated regardless of the order of symbols in the `syms` parameter.",
