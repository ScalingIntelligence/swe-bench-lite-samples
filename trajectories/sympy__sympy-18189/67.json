The 'diophantine' function has logic that determines when to apply permutations based on the equation type and the presence of specific coefficients. The utility functions 'permute_signs' and 'signed_permutations' handle the actual permutation of solution signs and full permutations of solutions, respectively. Given the inconsistent results observed with differing orders of 'syms' when 'permute=True', it is crucial to inspect the permutation logic within the 'diophantine' function and ensure that 'permute_signs' and 'signed_permutations' correctly handle all permutations. Further investigation should focus on how the permutations are applied and whether the logic accounts for all possible permutation scenarios uniformly.",
