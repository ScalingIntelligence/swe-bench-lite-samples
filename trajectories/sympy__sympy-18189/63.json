This suggests that the function might not be correctly permuting the solutions based on the order of provided symbols. To address this, we need to focus on the `diophantine` function's implementation, particularly where it handles the `permute` parameter and processes the solutions. From the search results, the `diophantine` function appears to be located in `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py`. The relevant code spans include the entire `diophantine` function implementation and its import statements. These spans provide the necessary context to understand how the function processes equations and permutations. By examining these spans, we can determine if the permutation logic is correctly implemented and how it interacts with the `syms` parameter. The provided code spans are directly relevant to the issue as they include the main function where the permutation logic resides and its related helper functions.",
