In the new search results, there are several spans that are relevant to the issue. Notably, the 'diophantine' and 'diop_solve' function spans provide context on how the permutations are controlled and handled within the code. Additionally, several helper functions like '_is_int', '_sorted_tuple', and 'divisible' provide utility for processing solutions. The 'power_representation' function is also relevant as it deals with generating representations using powers, which could be involved in the issue's context. This information collectively helps in understanding and potentially addressing the issue reported regarding permutation and the order of symbols.
