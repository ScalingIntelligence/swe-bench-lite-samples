The issue specifically notes that the function returns incomplete results depending on the order of symbols when the 'permute' parameter is set to True. This discrepancy is observed in the example provided in the issue description. To address this, we need to focus on the 'diophantine' function's handling of the 'permute' parameter and how it manages permutations of solutions based on the order of symbols given in 'syms'.\n\nReviewing the 'diophantine' code span, we can see that the function processes the equation, extracts the variables, and applies permutations based on the 'permute' parameter. The logic related to permutation handling is present within the conditional blocks associated with 'permute' and involves setting flags like 'do_permute_signs', 'do_permute_signs_var', and 'permute_few_signs'. These flags control how solutions are permuted and whether additional permutations are required based on the equation type and variable interactions.\n\nGiven the issue description, it is clear that the current permutation logic in the 'diophantine' function does not consistently produce complete sets of solutions for all symbol orders when 'permute' is True. This suggests a potential flaw or edge case in the permutation logic that needs further investigation. The relevant code spans that need to be examined closely are those that initialize, check, and apply these permutation flags based on the equation type and variable characteristics.",
