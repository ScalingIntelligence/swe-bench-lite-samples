The logic for permutation handling and solution merging is present in the code, particularly where the `do_permute_signs`, `permute_few_signs`, and `do_permute_signs_var` flags are used to manage different types of permutations. The code also includes detailed checks and logic for permuting signs and variables, which are relevant to the issue.
