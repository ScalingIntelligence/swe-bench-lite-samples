  "initial_message": "uniq modifies list argument\nWhen you iterate over a dictionary or set and try to modify it while doing so you get an error from Python:\r\n```python\r\n>>> multiset('THISTLE')\r\n{'T': 2, 'H': 1, 'I': 1, 'S': 1, 'L': 1, 'E': 1}\r\n>>> for i in _:\r\n...   _.pop(i)\r\n...\r\n2\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nRuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration\r\n```\r\nIt would be good to do the same thing from within `uniq` because the output will silently be wrong if you modify a passed list:\r\n```python\r\n>>> f=list('THISTLE')\r\n>>> for i in uniq(f):\r\n...   f.remove(i)\r\n...   i\r\n...\r\n'T'\r\n'I'\r\n'L'\r\n```\r\nI think this would entail recording the size at the start and then checking the size and raising a similar RuntimeError if the size changes.\n"
