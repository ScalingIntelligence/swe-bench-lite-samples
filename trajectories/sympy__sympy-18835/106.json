The `uniq` function, located in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`, is highlighted as potentially problematic when used to modify a list during iteration. To address this, it's suggested to check the size of the list at the start of the function and raise an error if the size changes during the iteration. This approach mirrors the behavior when trying to modify dictionaries or sets during iteration, ensuring error visibility for users. Given the context and the function's location, focusing on the `uniq` function within the `iterables.py` file would be the most pertinent search.",
