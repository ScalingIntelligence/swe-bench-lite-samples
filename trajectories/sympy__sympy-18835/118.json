This suggests the need to detect changes in the list's size during iteration and raise an error if such changes occur. I will evaluate the existing implementation of `uniq` and other relevant code spans in the search results for their potential to resolve or contribute to the issue's solution. The initial implementation of `uniq` in the file context does not currently check for size changes during iteration, which is a significant point for improvement. After reviewing the search results, the following code spans are identified as potentially relevant: 1) The existing `uniq` function for its core functionality that might need enhancement. 2) The `numbered_symbols` function for its handling of iteration and modification checks, which could be relevant for implementing similar checks in `uniq`. 3) The `dict_merge` function for its pattern of iterating over a collection while managing changes, which might offer insights into managing changes during iteration. These selections are based on their relevance to the problem of iterating over a collection while potentially modifying its size, and their potential to inform a solution for detecting and responding to such modifications in `uniq`.",
