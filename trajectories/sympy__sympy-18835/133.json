To address this, the proposed solution involves checking the size of the list at the start of the iteration and raising a `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration. The provided `uniq` function indeed modifies the input list during iteration without any checks. The search results include the same `uniq` function definition found in the file context. The relevant part of the code is the `uniq` function itself, as it needs to be modified to include the size check and error handling as described in the issue. Since the search results do not provide additional relevant code spans or files, the identified spans include only the `uniq` function.",
