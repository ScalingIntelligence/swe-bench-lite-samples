The focus is on the `uniq` function needing to raise an error if the list size changes during iteration to avoid silent errors. 2. The search results provide the `uniq` function implementation. It's crucial to understand how this function operates: it uses a set to track seen items and yields unique items from the sequence. However, it does not currently check for modifications to the sequence during iteration. 3. To address the issue, the `uniq` function would need to incorporate a mechanism to detect changes in the size of the sequence while iterating over it and raise an appropriate error if such a change occurs. This would involve recording the size of the sequence at the start and then periodically checking it during iteration to ensure consistency. Such a check is currently not implemented in the provided code, making the identified span relevant for further modification to address the reported issue.",
