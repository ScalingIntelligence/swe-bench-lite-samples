The provided code span for the `uniq` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` defines the `uniq` function and includes a generator that yields unique items from the sequence. However, it does not currently include the functionality to detect changes to the size of the sequence during iteration. The current implementation uses a set to track seen items and yields items that have not been seen, but it does not check if the sequence size has changed during the process. This omission could lead to silent errors if the sequence is modified during iteration, as mentioned in the issue.

The current implementation of `uniq` in the search results is almost identical to the one in the file context, but it lacks the additional logic to check for changes in the size of the list during iteration, which was suggested as a fix. To address this, we need to add some form of size checking at the beginning of the iteration to detect any modifications made to the sequence while iterating over it. This would involve recording the initial size of the sequence (if it's countable) and then comparing it at each step. If a size change is detected, a `RuntimeError` should be raised to indicate the problem. The relevant code span appears to be the entire `uniq` function implementation, as it needs to be updated.",
