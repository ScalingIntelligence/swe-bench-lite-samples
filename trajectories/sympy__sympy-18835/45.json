The desired solution is to raise a RuntimeError if the size of the list changes during iteration, similar to how Python handles modifications to dictionaries or sets during iteration.\n\nIn the provided search results, there is a section of code in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` that defines the `uniq` function. This function is responsible for yielding unique elements from a sequence. The function currently does not check for modifications to the size of the sequence during iteration, which is the core issue mentioned in the reported issue.\n\nIdentifying the exact location of the `uniq` function in the search results is crucial for making modifications to ensure that it raises an error when detecting changes to the size of the list during iteration. This aligns with the user's request to implement similar behavior to Python's handling of dictionary and set modifications during iteration.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code span is located within the `uniq` span in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`, as it directly relates to what needs to be modified to address the reported issue.",
