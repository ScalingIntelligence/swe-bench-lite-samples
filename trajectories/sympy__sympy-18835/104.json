To resolve this, the `uniq` function should raise a `RuntimeError` if the list's size changes during iteration. Relevant files might be `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`, where the `uniq` function is defined, and possibly `sympy/core/containers.py` for container handling. The search should focus on finding the definition and usage of the `uniq` function and any associated list modification checks.",

The `uniq` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` is identified as a potential candidate for this issue. The current implementation of `uniq` does not check for modifications to the input list during iteration, which could lead to silent errors. By recording the size of the list at the start of the function and checking it again after each iteration, we can raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes, ensuring that modifications to the list during iteration are caught. This approach mirrors Python's handling of dictionary changes during iteration, providing a more consistent and safer user experience. The `OrderedSet` class in `sympy/core/containers.py` could also serve as a reference for how to handle size checks during iteration, as it includes methods for adding, discarding, and popping elements while maintaining a set of keys, providing a similar use case.",

The current implementation of `uniq` does not account for potential modifications during iteration, which can alter the length of the sequence. The solution suggested involves recording the size at the start and then checking the size to raise a `RuntimeError` if it changes, ensuring the integrity of the sequence during iteration. The search results include several utility functions, but the critical span is the `uniq` function in 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py', as it directly relates to the issue at hand.
