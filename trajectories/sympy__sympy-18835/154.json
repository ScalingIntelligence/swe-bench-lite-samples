The error suggests that catching changes in size during iteration is essential for raising a RuntimeError. The `uniq` function and related data structures like dictionaries and sets should be inspected for potential modifications during iteration. Given the context, focusing on the `uniq` function in the iterables module and associated data structures in the core containers module is crucial.",
