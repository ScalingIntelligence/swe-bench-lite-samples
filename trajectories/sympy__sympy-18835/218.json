However, there is no mechanism to check if the list size has changed during iteration. To address the reported issue, it would be necessary to add a size check at the beginning of the function to compare with the size during iteration and raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes, similar to what Python does with dictionaries or sets when they are modified during iteration.
