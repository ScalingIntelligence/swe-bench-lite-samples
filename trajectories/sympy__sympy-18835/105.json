Python does not allow modification of a list while iterating over it, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. To address this, the function `uniq` should check if the size of the list has changed during iteration and raise a RuntimeError if it has. Several files in the sympy directory contain functions related to iterables and sets, which might be relevant. The function `uniq` and related functions such as `multiset` are present in 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py'. Additionally, the 'Dict' and 'OrderedSet' classes in 'sympy/core/containers.py' might also be relevant as they involve handling of dictionaries and sets.",
