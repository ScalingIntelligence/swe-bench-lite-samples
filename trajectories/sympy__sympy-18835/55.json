I analyzed the `uniq` function in the search results and identified its implementation. The function currently does not check for changes in the size of the list during iteration. The search results also include other functions such as `flatten`, `take`, `dict_merge`, etc., but none of these directly address the issue with modifying the list in `uniq`.

The task requires modifying the `uniq` function to check the size of the list at the start of iteration and raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration.
