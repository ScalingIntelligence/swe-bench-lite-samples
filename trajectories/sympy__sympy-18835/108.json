The current implementation of `uniq` does not handle cases where the list might be modified during iteration, leading to inconsistent results. The provided search results include the `uniq` function (span id 'uniq'), which matches the context provided initially. Additionally, searching the entire codebase revealed more functions that could have relevance in broader context or for understanding the current behavior. For the purpose of resolving the specific issue, the primary focus remains on modifying the `uniq` function to prevent modifications during its operation, possibly by checking the state before and after iteration to ensure consistency. This involves analyzing the `uniq` code span for potential enhancements to handle such edge cases gracefully. Based on relevance to the issue, updating or enhancing the `uniq` function is necessary, which needs careful consideration to ensure it handles input changes appropriately without causing runtime errors.",
