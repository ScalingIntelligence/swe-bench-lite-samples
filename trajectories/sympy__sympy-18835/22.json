This requires a thorough examination of the existing 'uniq' function and potential alternative implementations.\n\n1) **Existing 'uniq' Function**: The current 'uniq' function in 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py' is designed to yield unique elements from a sequence. It uses a set to track seen elements and yields an element only if it hasn't been seen before. However, this function does not currently check for modifications to the list during iteration, which is necessary to raise a RuntimeError as requested.\n\n2) **Potential Alternative**: The 'unique_list' function in 'sympy/utilities/_compilation/util.py' could be a starting point for implementing similar functionality. This function builds a list of unique elements but does not guard against modifications during iteration. It could be adapted to include a size check at the beginning of the function and raise a RuntimeError if the list size changes during execution.\n\n3) **Decision on Relevance**: Given the goal of modifying the 'uniq' function to include size checking and error raising, the existing 'uniq' function and the 'unique_list' function are potentially relevant. However, neither function currently includes the necessary size check and error handling.\n\nFor completeness and accuracy, it would be prudent to review any other parts of the codebase that interact with these functions or handle list modifications during iteration.",
