The problem is that modifying a list while iterating over it using `uniq` can silently produce incorrect results. To address this, the proposed solution involves recording the size of the list at the start of the iteration and raising a `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration. Based on the issue and the provided context, it is clear that the `uniq` function is the main focus. Hence, a detailed review of this function is needed to implement the suggested change.",

However, this version does not check or raise an error if the list argument is modified during its operation. In 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py', the 'uniq' function is more comprehensive and includes a generator that yields unique items from the sequence. This version also does not currently check for modifications to the list size during its operation. Both of these code spans are relevant because they contain the 'uniq' function, which is central to the reported issue. The task is not complete because neither version of the 'uniq' function currently checks or raises an error for modifications to the list size during iteration, which is the core requirement described in the issue.
