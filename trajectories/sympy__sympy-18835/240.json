The suggested solution is to record the size of the list at the start of the `uniq` function and raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration, similar to how Python handles changes to dictionaries during iteration. The relevant code span is located in the 'uniq' function within 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py'.
