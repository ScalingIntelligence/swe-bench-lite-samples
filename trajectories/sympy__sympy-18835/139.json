The provided code snippet in `uniq` suggests a generator function that yields unique items from a sequence. However, it does not currently check for modifications to the sequence during iteration. Given the issue, the focus should be on identifying or enhancing the `uniq` function to detect changes in the size of the sequence during iteration and raise a `RuntimeError` if such changes occur. The current implementation of `uniq` in the search results does not include size checking, and it primarily focuses on yielding unique items.
