It would involve recording the size of the list at the start of the `uniq` function's operation and raising a RuntimeError if the size changes during iteration. This approach is similar to how Python handles changes to dictionaries during iteration. Therefore, the search should focus on the `uniq` function and the surrounding code in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file.",
