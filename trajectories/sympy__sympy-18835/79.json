The existing `uniq` function in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file already exists and appears to be designed to yield unique elements from a sequence. However, it does not currently check for modifications to the sequence during iteration. This is the critical part of the code that needs to be modified to align with the reported issue. By adding a size check at the beginning of the function and comparing it with the current size during iteration, we can raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes, thus preventing silent incorrect outputs. This step-by-step approach ensures that the modification to the function will adhere to the requirements set forth in the reported issue.",
