To address this, we need to ensure that if the size of the list changes during iteration, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

Therefore, the focus should be on this module to find the `uniq` function and potentially related functions that handle list or dictionary iteration. Additionally, since the issue involves modifying a list during iteration, it's also relevant to look at how lists and dictionaries are handled in other parts of the codebase to ensure consistency.",
