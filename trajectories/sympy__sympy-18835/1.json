This function is designed to yield unique elements from a sequence. The function uses a set to track seen elements and yields an element if it hasn't been seen before. The function also handles sequences that cannot be added to a set due to `TypeError` by checking against the result list.\n\nTo address the issue, the relevant code span is the implementation of the `uniq` function.
