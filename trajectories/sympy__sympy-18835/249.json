The provided search results include a function `uniq` in two different files. The first instance in `sympy/benchmarks/bench_symbench.py` defines `uniq` to return a set of unique elements from a list, which does not address the issue of modifying the list during iteration. The second instance in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` defines a more comprehensive `uniq` function that yields unique elements and handles TypeErrors. This latter implementation does not directly address the issue of preventing modifications to the list during iteration but is more relevant to the context of the reported issue. Given the issue's requirement to raise a `RuntimeError` if the list size changes during iteration, this part is not addressed in the provided code. However, the `uniq` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` has the potential to be modified to incorporate this functionality. Therefore, the focus should be on this file and function as a basis for further modifications.",

This issue can be mitigated by recording the size of the list at the start and then checking if the size changes during iteration, raising a `RuntimeError` if it does. The current implementation of `uniq` in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file does not include this size-checking mechanism. However, it does yield unique elements from the sequence, which is related to the functionality mentioned in the issue. Upon reviewing the new search results, I did not find any additional relevant code spans that would directly address the issue of size change during iteration in the `uniq` function.
