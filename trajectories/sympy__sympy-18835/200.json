The solution involves checking the size of the list at the start and raising an error if the size changes during iteration. The search results contain two relevant code spans:\n1. In `bench_R5`, there's a definition of `uniq` that converts the input list to a set, which doesn't address the issue of modifying the list during iteration.\n2. In `iterables.py`, there's a more detailed implementation of `uniq` using a `set` to track seen elements and yield unique elements. This implementation iterates over the sequence and checks if each element is in the `seen` set. However, it doesn't check for modifications to the original list's size during iteration.\n\nBased on the reported issue's requirement to detect modifications during iteration, the implementation in `iterables.py` is more relevant as it allows for identifying unique elements but can benefit from the addition of a size check to prevent silent incorrect outputs.",

To address this, the solution involves recording the size of the list at the beginning of the iteration and then checking if the size changes during the iteration. If the size changes, a `RuntimeError` should be raised. This ensures that any attempt to modify the list during iteration is immediately detected and results in an error. The relevant code spans for implementing this solution are identified in the `uniq` function within `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`.
