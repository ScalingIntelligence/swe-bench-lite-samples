The task is to identify code spans that are relevant to the `uniq` function and could be used to implement a check for size changes during iteration, raising a `RuntimeError` if the size changes. The search results provide two relevant code spans: one in `sympy/benchmarks/bench_symbench.py` which defines the `uniq` function but does not include the size check, and another in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` which also defines the `uniq` function but includes exception handling and additional logic not directly related to the size check needed. Both spans define a `uniq` function, but neither includes a mechanism to check for size changes during iteration. For now, the identified spans provide context on how the `uniq` function is implemented, but do not directly address the issue of size change detection.
