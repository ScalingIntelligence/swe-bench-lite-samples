The specific concern is that silently incorrect outputs may occur if the list is modified during iteration.

The search results contain a definition of the `uniq` function, which is relevant to the issue. However, the current implementation does not address the specific concern of modifying the list during iteration. It does not check the size before and during iteration to detect changes in size. To resolve the issue, modifications would need to be made to the `uniq` function to include size checking before and during iteration.
