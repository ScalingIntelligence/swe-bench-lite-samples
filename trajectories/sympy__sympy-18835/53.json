The issue emphasizes the need to raise a `RuntimeError` if the size of the list changes during iteration, similar to how dictionaries behave in Python. The function `uniq` in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` is a primary candidate for this modification as it iterates over the sequence and yields unique items. The current implementation of `uniq` does not check for changes in the size of the sequence during iteration, which aligns with the need to add this functionality. Additionally, understanding the behavior of dictionaries and sets during iteration, as demonstrated in the issue, helps in grasping the context of the required change. The `sympy/core/containers.py` files provide context on how dictionaries and sets are handled in the SymPy library, which is useful for understanding the broader context but does not directly address the issue related to modifying lists during iteration in the `uniq` function.",
