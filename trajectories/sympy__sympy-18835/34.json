This is similar to how Python raises an error when modifying a dictionary or set during iteration. To address this, we need to identify the `uniq` function in the codebase and potentially other related functions like `multiset` and `multiset_combinations` that might interact with `uniq`. The search results provide multiple code spans, but the most relevant ones are those involving the `uniq` function itself and the `multiset` function, which constructs a dictionary of item counts from a sequence. The `uniq` function in the search results is used to filter unique elements from a sequence, but it currently does not check for modifications to the sequence during iteration. This aligns with the need described in the issue to add a size check at the start of the function and raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration.",
