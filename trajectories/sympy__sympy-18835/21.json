Since `uniq` is part of the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` module, we can start by examining that file closely.

The function is designed to yield unique items from a sequence, and the issue can arise if the sequence size changes during iteration. The `Dict` class in `sympy/core/containers.py` does not directly relate to the `uniq` function but is about immutable dictionaries. Similarly, the `OrderedSet` class seems unrelated as it is focused on sets, not lists.
