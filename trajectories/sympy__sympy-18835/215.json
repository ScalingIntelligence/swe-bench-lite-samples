The user wants to add a size check at the start of the function to raise a `RuntimeError` if the size of the list changes during iteration. In the search results, the `uniq` function is found in the file 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py', which appears to be a utility function for iterating over unique elements in a sequence. This function uses a `set` to track seen items and yields unique elements. It handles `TypeError` by appending elements to a result list, which might be related to the list modification issue. Since the issue specifically mentions modifying the list argument within `uniq`, this function is highly relevant as it directly deals with the list being modified and can serve as the starting point for adding the size check and error handling.",
