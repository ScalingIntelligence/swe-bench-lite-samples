This functionality is not present, meaning the specific improvement suggested in the issue related to checking and reacting to changes in list size during iteration is not implemented in the provided code. However, the code already handles two special cases (adding seen elements to a set and recursing over the seq) which suggests it's designed to handle uniqueness in a variety of scenarios, hinting that the addition of size-change-checking could be integrated into this framework. The current implementation of uniq, by using a set to track seen items, does not fully address the issue because it doesn't prevent or detect modifications to the list that occur while iterating over it. Therefore, the current file context does not contain all the relevant code to address the issue completely.",
