The `uniq` function is a candidate for investigation as it could be used to filter or modify lists. The `uniq` function is located in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file, which makes it a primary target for investigation. Additionally, examining the `multiset` function from the same file could provide insight into how multi-set type operations might relate to the issue. Furthermore, error checking and handling mechanisms within the `uniq` function could be relevant to implement the suggested runtime size change check.",
