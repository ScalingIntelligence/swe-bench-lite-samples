The `uniq` function from the search results is likely relevant because it iterates over a sequence and yields unique items. The issue suggests that if the sequence (list) is modified during iteration in `uniq`, it could lead to incorrect results. The solution proposed is to record the size of the list at the start of iteration in `uniq` and raise an error if the size changes during iteration, similar to Python's handling of dictionary sizes during iteration. The `uniq` function in the search results already dynamically checks the presence of items in a set to yield unique items, but it does not currently handle or check for modifications to the list during iteration.",
