This behavior should be changed to raise an error if the size of the list changes during iteration, similar to how Python handles dictionary changes during iteration. Given the context, the `uniq` function is likely to be implemented in a file that deals with utility functions for iterables. The `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file is mentioned as containing several utility functions, so it is likely that `uniq` is defined there. To ensure a thorough search, we should search for the `uniq` function specifically and also look for any helper functions used within `uniq` that might handle the size checking.",
