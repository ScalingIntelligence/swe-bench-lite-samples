The example provided shows that modifying a dictionary or set during iteration raises an error, and the suggestion is to apply the same logic within the `uniq` function to prevent silent errors. The current implementation of `uniq` is found in the context and search results, and it does not currently check for modifications to the passed sequence during iteration. The task is to identify relevant code spans to address this issue and possibly modify the `uniq` function to include checks for sequence size modifications during iteration. The search results include the `uniq` function along with other utility functions like `group`, `multiset`, `multiset_combinations`, and `multiset_partitions`. These functions are related to handling sequences and might be relevant if the solution involves modifying how sequences are processed in a loop. The current context and search results do not directly address the need to check for modifications of the sequence size during the `uniq` function's operation. More specifically, the `uniq` function does not currently have a mechanism to prevent or detect modifications to the sequence while it is being iterated over. This suggests that the identified spans may need to be expanded or complemented with additional logic to fulfill the requirement from the issue report.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue identifies a problem where modifying a list while iterating over it using the `uniq` function can lead to incorrect results without raising an error. The task is to enhance `uniq` to detect if the list size changes during iteration and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. The current implementation of `uniq` in the file context checks for uniqueness using a set and yields unique items from the sequence. However, it does not currently check for modifications to the sequence during iteration. The new search results bring forth the `uniq` function again, showing a slightly different implementation. Comparing the two versions, the original version checks for iterations and uniqueness differently. Neither currently checks for the sequence being modified during iteration. This indicates a clear area for improvement based on the reported issue. Additionally, other files show related functionalities such as `OrderedSet` and `Dict`, which might indirectly relate to the handling of iterators and modifications, but the direct relevance is the `uniq` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`.",
