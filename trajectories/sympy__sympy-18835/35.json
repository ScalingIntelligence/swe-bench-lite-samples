To address this, the function should check the size of the list at the start and raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration, similar to how Python handles dictionary modifications during iteration. The relevant code is likely in the `iterables.py` file, which contains the `uniq` function. Additionally, other files like `containers.py` and `core/compatibility.py` might also be relevant due to their handling of dictionaries and ordered sets, which could inform how to implement this check.",
