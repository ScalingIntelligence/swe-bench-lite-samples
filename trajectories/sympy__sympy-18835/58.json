The main concern is to detect if the list size changes during iteration and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. The provided search results include two different implementations of the `uniq` function. The first implementation in 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py' uses a generator function to yield unique items from the sequence. However, it does not check for list size changes during iteration. The second implementation in 'sympy/benchmarks/bench_symbench.py' simply converts the list to a set to remove duplicates, which is not directly relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to focus on modifying the `uniq` function in 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py' to include a size check before and during iteration. This will help detect any changes in the list size and raise the appropriate error if the size changes. The other implementation in 'sympy/benchmarks/bench_symbench.py' is not relevant as it does not involve iteration over the list while modifying it.",
