The example provided demonstrates this issue with dictionaries and suggests that a similar mechanism should be implemented in the `uniq` function to prevent silent errors when modifying a list passed to `uniq`. The current implementation of `uniq` in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` does not include any mechanism to check for modifications to the list during iteration. Therefore, the relevant code span to address this issue is the `uniq` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`. Implementing the suggested enhancement would require adding a check to compare the size of the list at the start of the function with its size during iteration, raising a `RuntimeError` if the size changes. This would align with Python's behavior for dictionaries and sets when they are modified during iteration. The other code spans provided do not directly relate to the specific problem of modifying a list during iteration in the context of the `uniq` function.",
