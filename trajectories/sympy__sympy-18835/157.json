The issue suggests that `uniq` should raise a `RuntimeError` if the size of the list is changed during iteration, similar to how Python handles modifications during iteration over dictionaries or sets. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the `uniq` function that handle list iteration and modification checking. The relevant code span is the one containing the implementation of the `uniq` function, which includes the logic for iterating over the list and yielding unique elements. This span should be modified to include size checking at the start of the iteration and raise an error if the size changes during iteration. The search task is complete as we have identified the relevant code span for the `uniq` function.",
