Additionally, checking for any related functions or classes in the `sympy.utilities` module, where `iterables.py` is located, might be beneficial.",

The provided code snippet in the issue demonstrates this behavior with a dictionary and suggests the need for a similar check within the `uniq` function. The search results contain the `uniq` function from the `sympy.utilities.iterables` module. Reviewing this function, it is evident that it currently does not check for changes in the size of the list during iteration, which is the specific concern raised in the issue. The current implementation of `uniq` uses a set to track seen elements and yields them if they haven't been seen before. While this ensures uniqueness, it does not address the issue of modifying the list size during iteration. Therefore, the relevant code span here is the implementation of the `uniq` function, as it needs to be modified to include a size check or to handle modifications within the loop.",
