The goal is to implement a check within the `uniq` function to raise a `RuntimeError` if the size of the list changes during iteration. The provided search results contain a `uniq` function in two different files. The first file, 'sympy/benchmarks/bench_symbench.py', has a simplified `uniq` function that converts the list to a set and returns it. This does not address the issue of detecting changes in list size during iteration. The second file, 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py', contains a more complex `uniq` function that iterates over the sequence and yields unique elements. This function does not currently check for changes in list size during iteration, which aligns with the issue reported. Therefore, the relevant code span is the `uniq` function in 'sympy/utilities/iterables.py'. This is the part of the codebase where the necessary modifications should be made to add the size change detection.",
