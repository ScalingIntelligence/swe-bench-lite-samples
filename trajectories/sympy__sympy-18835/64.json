Additionally, the `Dict` and `OrderedSet` classes in `sympy/core/containers.py` are container types that Python users might interact with, possibly encountering the described error when modifying them during iteration. I should narrow down the search to the `uniq` function in `iterables.py` and ensure that the functionality to detect modifications during iteration is implemented.

Also consider checking the `multiset` function in `iterables.py` as `uniq` might be used within it.",

The function currently uses a set to track seen elements and yields unique elements from the sequence. However, it lacks the mechanism to detect and prevent modifications to the list during iteration, which is the enhancement suggested in the issue. Analyzing the code, the function could be improved by recording the size of the list at the start of the iteration and then checking if the size changes during iteration.

This function ensures that sequences do not contain duplicate items during iteration but lacks the necessary checks to prevent modifications of the sequence during iteration. The issue reports a silent error that arises if you modify a passed list during iteration with `uniq`. To address this, modifications need to be made in the `uniq` function to include size checks that detect if the sequence has been modified during iteration. Additionally, the functions that call `uniq`, such as `multiset` and `multiset_combinations`, should also be reviewed and possibly modified to ensure they are passing sequences to `uniq` that can be safely iterated over without modification. The relevant parts of the code, including the `uniq` function and the other functions that interact with it, have been found within the provided file context.
