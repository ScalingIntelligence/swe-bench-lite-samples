The desired behavior is to raise a `RuntimeError` if the list size changes during iteration, similar to how Python handles modifying dictionaries during iteration. The current implementation of `uniq` in the file context is the primary focus as it directly relates to the issue. I will analyze the current implementation to determine how to introduce the size checking mechanism as suggested in the issue. The search results provided additional context around other functions and imports, but none directly relate to the `uniq` function's behavior concerning list modification during iteration.",
