To address this, the solution proposed is to monitor the size of the list at the start of the `uniq` function and raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration. This suggests that the `uniq` function must be modified to include size checking and error handling. From the provided context, it's evident that `uniq` is located in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`. First, I should check if `uniq` already has the necessary size checks and error handling. If not, I should search for other places in the codebase where list or dictionary modification during iteration is handled correctly as a reference for implementing the solution.",
