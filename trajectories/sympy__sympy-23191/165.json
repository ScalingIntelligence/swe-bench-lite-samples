The code provided uses `pprint` to print `vecB` and `vecE`, and the output is jumbled with unit vectors inserted in the middle. This indicates an issue with the pretty printing of vector objects. \n\nThe search results include several relevant files and spans of code that handle pretty printing of vector objects in SymPy. The `PrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains methods such as `_print_Cross`, `_print_Curl`, `_print_Divergence`, `_print_Dot`, and `_print_BasisDependent`, which are directly related to the printing of vector operations and vector components. The `Vector` class in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` also contains methods related to pretty printing, specifically `_pretty` and `_latex`. Additional relevant methods in the `VectorPrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` handle the printing of derivatives and functions specific to vector physics.\n\nGiven the context of the issue, these spans of code are likely to contain the culprit or solution for the reported pretty printing bug. Specifically, the `_print_BasisDependent` method in `PrettyPrinter` and the `_pretty` method in `Vector` are central to how vector components are pretty printed, and they should be closely examined for any issues related to the positioning of unit vectors. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to solve the reported issue.",
