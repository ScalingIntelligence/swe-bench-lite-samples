The code provided uses `pprint` to display vectors and integral expressions, which are integral to the sympy.vector module. From the search results, the relevant sections of the codebase that could be causing the issue are those that handle the pretty printing of vectors, integrals, and derivatives, as these are the components that are incorrectly displayed. The spans identified include methods for handling the pretty printing of cross products (_print_Cross), dot products (_print_Dot), derivatives (_print_Derivative), and integrals (_print_Integral). Additionally, the method _print_BasisDependent, which is responsible for printing basis dependent expressions like vectors, appears to have a complex handling of the string formatting that could lead to misplacement or misalignment. These sections are directly related to the functionality being used in the provided code, and changes in them could potentially fix the jumbled output issue. However, without detailed knowledge of the internal SymPy library behavior and how these methods interact, it is not possible to determine the exact cause of the bug or how to fix it, but these sections are a good starting point for investigation.",
