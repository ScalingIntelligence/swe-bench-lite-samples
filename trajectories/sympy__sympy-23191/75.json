To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the `PrettyPrinter` class, particularly focusing on methods related to pretty printing vectors and handling their display formatting. The provided search results include multiple code spans from `PrettyPrinter`, as well as from related classes like `Dyadic` and `Vector`. Several spans appear relevant: `PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent`, which handles the pretty printing of `BasisDependent` objects like vectors, and `PrettyPrinter._hprint_vec`, which seems to handle the horizontal printing of vectors. Additionally, the `Vector._pretty` and `Dyadic._pretty` methods are also relevant as they define how instances of these classes should be pretty printed. These methods contain logic for formatting the output of vector and dyadic objects, which can be investigated to see if they are causing the issue described. Based on this analysis, the identified spans should be relevant for addressing the reported issue.",
