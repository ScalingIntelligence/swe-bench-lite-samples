The issue specifically mentions that the unit vector is being inserted in the middle of the output, causing the output to be jumbled. This suggests that the problem lies within the pretty printing functionality for `sympy.vector` objects.\n\nUpon examining the provided search results, the following key areas are identified as potentially relevant:\n1. `PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent` in `pretty.py`: This method is responsible for pretty printing objects derived from `BasisDependent`, which includes `Vector` objects. The method logic includes handling of basis vectors and their coefficients, which are key elements mentioned in the reported issue.\n2. `Vector._pretty` in `vector.py`: This method is specifically for pretty printing `Vector` objects. It handles the pretty printing of vector components and their coefficients, aligning with the issue of unit vectors and coefficients.\n\nBoth of these methods are crucial for handling the pretty printing of `Vector` objects and directly address the elements mentioned in the reported issue. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue for further analysis and possible bug resolution.",
