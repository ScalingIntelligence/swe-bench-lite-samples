The code provided uses `pprint` to display both `vecB` and `vecE`, but the output is jumbled due to the insertion of the unit vector in the middle. To address this, we need to examine the code spans in the `PrettyPrinter` class, which is responsible for printing `sympy.vector` objects in a pretty format. Specifically, we should focus on the methods that handle the printing of `BasisDependent` objects, which include `Vector` objects. We can see that the `_print_BasisDependent` method in `PrettyPrinter` collects strings for each component of the vector, and these strings could likely be where the issue lies. There are also methods like `_print_Cross`, `_print_Curl`, etc., that handle specific vector operations, which could also be relevant if the issue arises from how these operations are printed. Given this analysis, the identified relevant code spans are those within `_print_BasisDependent`, `_print_Cross`, `_print_Dot`, and similar methods in `PrettyPrinter`.",
