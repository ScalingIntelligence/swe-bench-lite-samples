The issue highlights that the output jumbles some of the terminal outputs by inserting the unit vector in the middle. I reviewed the context of already identified files, which indicated no relevant code had been identified yet. Given the search results, I narrowed down the relevant areas that could address the reported issue. The key areas are the pretty printing methods in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py and the Vector class's _pretty method in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py. I studied the code span where pretty printing for BasisDependent objects is handled, particularly in PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent and Vector._pretty. The reason I've flagged these sections is that they are crucial for the proper formatting of vector outputs and could contain the bug causing the misalignment mentioned in the issue. Moving forward, these identified spans serve as a starting point for further impact analysis and bug fixing.",
