According to the user's example, the output appears to be visually jumbled, especially with unit vectors appearing in the middle. The search results contain code spans specifically related to vector printing and handling in the `PrettyPrinter` class. The span `_print_BasisDependent` contains logic for printing `BasisDependent` expressions, which includes vectors. This seems directly relevant to the reported issue because it involves the pretty printing of vectors and their components. The other spans, such as `_print_Cross`, `_print_Curl`, `_print_Divergence`, `_print_Dot`, `_print_Integral`, `_print_TensorProduct`, and `_print_KroneckerProduct`, although related to vector operations, may not directly address the specific formatting issue described.
