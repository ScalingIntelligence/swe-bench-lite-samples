Given the context and the code provided, it is evident that the pretty printing for vector objects might be incorrectly implemented or not handling certain expressions properly. To address this, it's crucial to check the relevant printing methods within the sympy library that deal with vector objects, particularly focusing on the `_pretty` method implementations in classes like Vector, Dyadic, and related printing modules. This will help identify where the formatting issue occurs and potentially leads to the unit vector being inserted incorrectly in the output.",

Given the nature of the issue, it is crucial to focus on the pretty printing functionality in the context of vector and dyadic objects. The search results provide relevant code spans from `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, which are all related to the pretty printing of vector and dyadic objects. The `_pretty` methods in both `Dyadic` and `Vector` classes are particularly relevant as they handle the pretty printing of these objects. Additionally, the `PrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` is responsible for the pretty printing of basis-dependent objects, which includes vectors. By analyzing these sections of code, we can identify the parts that might be causing the jumbled output and determine if there are any issues with the handling of unit vectors during the pretty printing process.",
