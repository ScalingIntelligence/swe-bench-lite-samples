The search should focus on files related to pretty printing and Vector handling in SymPy. Two potential files to check are 'pretty.py' under the printing module and 'vector.py' under the physics/vector module. Specific methods such as '_print_BasisDependent', which is likely to be involved with vector representations, will be targeted in the initial search. Additional files to consult if the initial search does not yield results could be those involved with LaTeX and MathML printing as a secondary check.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a display bug while using `pretty_print` with `sympy.vector` objects in the terminal. The issue specifically points out that the output is jumbled, particularly by inserting the unit vector in the middle. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans responsible for the pretty printing of vector objects. In the provided search results, the following key spans are identified as relevant: \n1. `PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent` (sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py) - This method is responsible for pretty printing instances of `BasisDependent`, which is a superclass for vector objects in sympy. It seems crucial for handling the display of vectors with their components.\n2. `Vector._pretty` (sympy/physics/vector/vector.py) - This method within the `Vector` class is used for pretty printing the vector object itself. It is likely where the components of the vector are formatted. Given the complexity in the formatting (handling of coefficients and basis vectors), this method should be scrutinized in relation to the display bug.\nThese spans are chosen because they directly deal with rendering vector objects into a pretty format, which is the exact aspect of the codebase relevant to the reported issue. The `PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent` method likely governs a broader set of operations related to the pretty printing of vector components, while `Vector._pretty` provides direct control over the generation of the pretty string representation within the `Vector` class.\nBy examining these methods, we can either confirm the existing implementation or identify deficiencies requiring fixes, thus addressing the display bug.",

This involves revising the logic in the `o1` list such that unit vectors are not inserted in the middle of the output, maintaining proper alignment and preventing the output from appearing jumbled.\n\nThe initial assessment determined that the entire code block from lines 1116 to 1193 is too large to process as a whole and thus the request to modify it was rejected. However, a more granular approach is now needed to specifically target the sections of code responsible for appending and managing the unit vectors in the o1 list. This involves identifying and adjusting the logic in lines 1116 to 1130 where unit vectors are appended to the o1 list, while ensuring that they are managed properly within the overall structure.",
