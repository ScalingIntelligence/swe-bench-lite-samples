The user's code involves multiple operations and the pretty printing of vectors, integrals, derivatives, and other mathematical expressions using sympy.vector and sympy modules. The output jumbles, especially when inserting unit vectors. Therefore, the relevant code spans should include methods from the PrettyPrinter class in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py responsible for pretty printing these mathematical objects. The code spans analyzed so far include methods like _print_Cross, _print_Dot, _print_Integral, _print_BasisDependent, and _print_Derivative. These methods are directly responsible for the pretty printing of cross and dot products, integrals, basis-dependent expressions, and derivatives, which are heavily used in the user's code. Additionally, the Vector class in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py includes a _pretty method that seems to be involved in the pretty printing of vector objects, which is also relevant to the issue as vectors are central to the user's script. Based on the user's code and the nature of the issue, these spans appear relevant. Moreover, since the VecDiff class was part of what I've looked at during the analysis phase, even though it wasn't provided here, it might also be relevant as it could involve methods responsible for differential operations on vectors, which could have an effect on the terminal output. The presence of Vector initialization and pretty printing methods in the provided code spans strongly suggests that these are where the relevant changes could provide a fix for the display bug. Therefore, I've identified the relevant spans and suggest these files and methods as highly pertinent to addressing the issue.",
