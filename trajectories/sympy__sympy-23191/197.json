Upon analyzing the provided code and search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are primarily located in the `PrettyPrinter` class within `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. The methods `_print_Integral` and `_print_BasisDependent` are key, as they handle the pretty printing of integrals and basis-dependent expressions, which are central to the issue at hand. The `PrettyPrinter` class is responsible for formatting the output in a readable way, and the issue might be arising due to the way these methods handle the integration of unit vectors into the printed expression. Therefore, the identified spans should help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the display bug.",
