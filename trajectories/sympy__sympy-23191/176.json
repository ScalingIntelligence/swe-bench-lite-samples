Since the output jumbles the unit vectors in the middle, the problem likely resides in the PrettyPrinter class's methods handling vector objects or their components. The provided file context mentions relevant files such as sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py and sympy/physics/vector/vector.py, which are crucial for investigation. Specifically, the _print_BasisDependent method in these files might be the starting point for understanding how basis vectors are handled and printed.",

The issue describes that the output gets jumbled, with unit vectors being inserted in the middle of the output. To address this, I reviewed the provided search results from `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`, and `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`.\n\nThe code spans in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` include various methods for pretty printing different mathematical operations such as `Cross`, `Curl`, `Divergence`, `Dot`, `Integral`, `TensorProduct`, `DotProduct`, `KroneckerProduct`, `MIMOSeries`, `MIMOFeedback`, and `BasisDependent`. These methods seem relevant because they handle the pretty printing of operations that might be involved in the vector object's output.\n\nIn `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, the `_pretty` method in the `Vector` class specifically addresses pretty printing for vector objects. This method iterates through the components of the vector and formats them appropriately.\n\nSimilarly, in `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`, the `_pretty` method in the `Dyadic` class formats dyadic objects for pretty printing.\n\nLastly, in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`, the `VectorPrettyPrinter` class includes methods for pretty printing derivatives and functions, which could be pertinent to the vector calculus operations involved in the reported issue.\n\nGiven the context of the issue and the search results, I have identified the relevant spans in the codebase that might need inspection or adjustment to resolve the reported display bug.",
