Specifically, the methods _print_BasisDependent, _print_Cross, and _print_Integral might be responsible for the incorrect formatting. To resolve this, we can start by examining these methods for any potential misplacement of the unit vectors within the string representations. A relevant change in the order of concatenating these elements might rectify the output jumbles. By ensuring that each component follows a sequential order in the printed text, we can likely address the display bug. Since the change appears to be straightforward and relevant to the provided context, I recommend initiating a change in the PrettyPrinter class methods.",
