The unit vectors are being inserted in the middle of the output, causing the output to be jumbled. The provided context includes various files from the sympy library that handle printing and vector operations. To investigate this issue, we should focus on the `PrettyPrinter` class and related methods in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, as well as the `Vector` and `Dyadic` classes in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` and `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`. Additionally, the `VectorPrettyPrinter` in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` and the `LatexPrinter` in `sympy/printing/latex.py` might also be relevant. We should look for methods that handle the pretty printing of vector expressions and investigate how they process and format unit vectors.",

The issue specifically mentions the incorrect placement of unit vectors. In the provided search results, several relevant code spans are identified.\n\nIn 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', the 'PrettyPrinter' class methods such as '_print_Cross', '_print_Curl', '_print_Divergence', '_print_Dot', '_print_MatrixElement', and '_print_BasisDependent' are relevant as they handle the pretty printing of vector operations and basis-dependent objects, which might be where the unit vectors are being mishandled.\n\nIn 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py', the 'Vector' class methods '_latex', '_pretty', and '_sympystr' are crucial as they define how vectors are represented in different formats, including pretty print. This includes conditional checks for coefficients being 1 or -1, which might lead to the omission or incorrect placement of unit vectors.\n\nIn 'sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py', the 'Dyadic' class methods '_latex', '_pretty', and '_sympystr' might also be relevant due to similar reasons regarding representation of components.\n\nAdditionally, 'sympy/physics/vector/printing.py' contains 'VectorPrettyPrinter' which specifically extends 'PrettyPrinter' for vector objects, and its '_print_Derivative' and '_print_Function' methods are also likely relevant for understanding how vector derivatives and functions are printed.\n\nFinally, 'sympy/printing/latex.py' has 'LatexPrinter' with methods '_print_Curl', '_print_Divergence', '_print_Dot', '_print_Laplacian', and '_print_BasisDependent', although these primarily deal with LaTeX printing, they can provide additional context for how vector operations are intended to be represented.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py', 'sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py', and 'sympy/physics/vector/printing.py' are most relevant to the issue at hand.",

The issue seems to be that the unit vector is being inserted in the middle of the output, causing the output to be jumbled. The provided search results include the PrettyPrinter class and its methods for handling BasisDependent objects, which are relevant to the printing of vector objects. Specifically, the _print_BasisDependent method in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py is of interest as it deals with how basis vectors and their coefficients are printed. Additionally, the Vector and Dyadic classes in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py and sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py, respectively, contain methods for pretty printing vector and dyadic expressions. These methods, such as _pretty in the Vector class and _pretty in the Dyadic class, handle the formatting of these objects for display. The VectorPrettyPrinter class in sympy/physics/vector/printing.py is also relevant as it customizes the pretty printing of derivative expressions specifically for vector objects. Based on the reported issue, the identified code spans are relevant to the task of fixing the display bug involving the pretty printing of sympy.vector objects.",
