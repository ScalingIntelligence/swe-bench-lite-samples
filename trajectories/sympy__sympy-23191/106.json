The specific problem is that the outputs are jumbled, with unit vectors being inserted in the middle. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code responsible for pretty printing vector objects in the terminal. The search results include several files, but the most relevant one is `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, which contains the `PrettyPrinter` class and its methods for handling different types of mathematical expressions, including vectors, integrals, and basis-dependent objects. Key methods to focus on are `_print_Cross`, `_print_Curl`, `_print_Dot`, `_print_Integral`, and `_print_BasisDependent`. These methods are likely where the issue of inserting unit vectors in the middle could be occurring. The `_print_BasisDependent` method, in particular, deals with the pretty printing of basis-dependent objects, which includes vectors. It constructs the pretty form of vector expressions by handling coefficients and basis vectors. This method seems directly relevant to the reported issue, as it constructs the string representation of vector expressions and handles coefficients and basis vectors. The `_print_Integral` method is also relevant as it handles the pretty printing of integrals, which is used in the provided code example to print the integral of a vector expression. Based on the analysis, the identified spans relevant to the reported issue are those within the `_print_BasisDependent` and `_print_Integral` methods in `pretty.py`. These spans are likely where the code responsible for the formatting and insertion of unit vectors in vector expressions resides. By focusing on these spans, we can further investigate and potentially resolve the issue of jumbled outputs in the terminal.",

The issue specifically mentions that the output gets jumbled, with the unit vector inserted in the middle. By analyzing the code and the reported issue, it's clear that the PrettyPrinter class in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py is responsible for the pretty printing functionality. The PrettyPrinter's methods such as _print_Integral and _print_BasisDependent are relevant since they handle the pretty printing of integrals and basis-dependent expressions, respectively. Additionally, the Vector class and its method _pretty in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py is also relevant as it deals with the pretty printing of vector objects, which aligns with the issue reported. The presence of code handling unit vectors and their coefficients in both the PrettyPrinter and Vector classes suggests that both sections of code are pertinent to resolving the issue at hand.",
