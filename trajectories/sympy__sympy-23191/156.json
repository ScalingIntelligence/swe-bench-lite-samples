The output is jumbled due to the incorrect placement of unit vectors. This indicates a potential bug in the 'PrettyPrinter' class or the '_pretty' methods for 'Vector' and 'Dyadic' classes in the context of 'sympy.physics.vector' module. Also, it may involve the '_print_Integral' and '_print_BasisDependent' methods within the 'PrettyPrinter' class itself. Investigating these specific parts of the code is crucial to resolve the issue.",

To address this, the following steps were taken:\n\n1. Reviewed the reported issue and understood that the main concern is the incorrect placement of the unit vector during pretty printing of vector expressions.\n2. Analyzed the provided `file_context` which includes code spans from `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`. These code spans handle pretty printing for vector objects and basis-dependent expressions.\n3. Examined new search results from `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. The key code span is `PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent`, which is responsible for printing basis-dependent expressions like vectors. This method iterates through components of the vector to format them appropriately.\n4. Identified: The issue likely stems from the concatenation of strings and prettyForms without properly aligning them, especially when handling the coefficients and the basis vectors.\n\nGiven these observations, the relevant code spans are those dealing with the pretty printing of BasisDependent objects, notably the '_print_BasisDependent' method. These captures the core logic of how vectors and their components are being pretty printed, where the issue of misalignment likely occurs.\n",
