To address this, it's necessary to inspect the pretty printing methods related to SymPy vectors and their formatting.

These classes deal with the formatting and representation of vector objects. Additionally, the VectorPrettyPrinter class in sympy/physics/vector/printing.py should be examined as it specializes in pretty printing for vectors.",

The key elements in the issue are the incorrect alignment and spacing of the unit vectors in the terminal output. From the search results, we can see that the PrettyPrinter class in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py contains methods that handle the pretty printing of various mathematical expressions and operations, including vectors. Notably, the methods _print_Cross, _print_Curl, _print_Divergence, _print_Dot, _print_Integral, and _print_BasisDependent are directly relevant as they handle the pretty printing of vector operations and vector basis dependent expressions. Additionally, the Vector class in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py contains the _pretty method which is responsible for the pretty printing of Vector objects. Therefore, these methods and classes are likely the places in the codebase where fixes or adjustments would need to be made to address the display bug.",
