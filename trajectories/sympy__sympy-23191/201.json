The relevant files to investigate are likely those related to vector printing in the `sympy.printing` and `sympy.physics.vector` modules. Specifically, the `_pretty` method in `Vector` and `Dyadic` classes might need attention. Furthermore, the `VectorPrettyPrinter` class in `sympy.physics.vector.printing` could be central to debugging this issue.",

The identified spans include `Dyadic._pretty`, `Dyadic._sympystr`, `PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent`, and `Vector._pretty`, as these are directly related to formatting vector outputs.
