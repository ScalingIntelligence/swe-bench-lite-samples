The code snippet provided demonstrates that the output gets jumbled when using 'pretty_print' with 'sympy.vector' objects. Based on the file context provided, it looks like the 'pretty_print' functionality might be implemented or extended in files within the 'sympy/printing' directory, particularly those dealing with 'PrettyPrinter' and 'VectorPrettyPrinter'. The 'sympy/physics/vector' directory also seems relevant, as it contains files related to vector and dyadic objects, which are likely to have methods for pretty printing. Therefore, the search should focus on these directories and specifically on classes and methods that deal with pretty printing and vector objects.",
