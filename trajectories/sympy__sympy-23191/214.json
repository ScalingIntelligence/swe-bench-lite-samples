This suggests that the problem might be in the pretty printing logic for vector objects in the specified files. Since the file `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` already contains methods for printing specific vector operations like Cross, Curl, etc., and `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` has methods specifically for vector pretty printing, these files are likely places to start the search for the bug. Additionally, the `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` file also contains a VectorPrettyPrinter class, which suggests it could also be relevant. Thus, focusing on these files with specific function names and methods related to pretty printing vector operations could pin down the source of the bug.",

The code provided indicates the user is experiencing jumbled outputs in the terminal with the unit vector being inserted in the middle. To address this, we need to focus on the pretty printing functionality within the `sympy` codebase, specifically related to handling vector objects. From the search results, there are several relevant spans that can help identify the root cause and potential fixes: \n1. `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains the `PrettyPrinter` class which is likely responsible for the pretty printing. Notably, the `_print_BasisDependent` method handles the pretty printing of basis dependent objects, which includes vectors. It also uses a check for `self._use_unicode` that may relate to the terminal output issues. \n2. `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` includes the `Vector` class, with methods `_pretty` and `_latex` that handle the pretty output. These methods will also be crucial in identifying how vector representations are being handled and displayed. \n3. `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` has custom printing classes like `VectorPrettyPrinter` that extend standard pretty printers. These are tailored for vector objects, possibly containing specific handling or configurations that could affect the printing output. \nBy focusing on these sections, we can gain insight into how vector objects are being processed during pretty printing and potentially pinpoint where adjustments need to be made to resolve the display bug.",
