These files contain classes and methods that specifically deal with the pretty printing of vector objects, which are likely to be the sources of the problem. It's important to focus on the method implementations for handling vector objects, particularly those related to the '_print_BasisDependent' method and any methods involving the printing of integrals and differential operators since the issue involves both of these elements.",
