Specifically, the issue is that the unit vectors are being inserted in the middle of the output, causing the text to jumble. The provided code sample and output show how the unit vectors like `xhat`, `yhat`, and `zhat` are not being displayed correctly within the function `pprint`. This suggests that the relevant code spans should be within the pretty-printing functionality of `sympy.vector`, especially where the `Vector` class and its pretty-printing methods (`_pretty`) are defined. The search results do indeed provide such code spans in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. Particularly, the spans in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` labeled `Vector.__init__` and `Vector._pretty` are directly relevant, as they define how `Vector` instances are initialized and how they should be pretty-printed. The span labeled `PrettyPrinter._print_Integral` in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` might also be relevant regarding the integration expressions present in the code sample. Taking all these into consideration, the identified spans are most likely to contain the necessary modifications to fix the pretty-printing issue.",

The reported issue involves a display bug when using `pretty_print` with `sympy.vector` objects in the terminal, specifically with unit vectors being inserted in the middle of outputs. This suggests a need to examine the pretty printing implementation within the context of vectors and their unit components.\n2. The current file context includes `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. These files contain key parts of the codebase that handle vector representation and pretty printing.\n3. In the provided search results, `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` contains classes `VectorLatexPrinter` and `VectorPrettyPrinter` that handle printing for vector objects, including LaTeX and pretty-print representations. Notably, there are methods in `VectorPrettyPrinter` that pay particular attention to the differentiation and printing of functions, especially in the context of dynamicsymbols used in vector physics calculations.\n4. Another interesting section is `PrettyPrinter` in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, which contains a method `_print_BasisDependent` that is relevant for printing BasisDependent (which includes vectors) in a pretty way, including handling of different basis components and their coefficients. This is directly relevant to ensuring that unit vectors are printed correctly and do not get inserted inappropriately.\n5. The provided spans appear to be directly related to the handling of printing vector-specific expressions, including the management of basis vectors and their coefficients, potentially offering solutions or issues that might cause the reported display bug.\n6. Therefore, based on the relevance to the printing of vector expressions and the direct handling of basis vectors, the identified span IDs should help resolve or diagnose the reported display issue within sympy's pretty-printing system.",

Furthermore, the `_print_Integral` method within sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py is present as well, which pertains to the pretty printing of integral expressions. These methods seemed relevant to the issue of terminal output jumbles when dealing with vector objects.
