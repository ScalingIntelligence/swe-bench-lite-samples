The output is jumbled, with unit vectors appearing in the middle of the expression. This suggests a problem with the PrettyPrinter class and its handling of vector objects. Relevant files in the SymPy repository include `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/dyadic.py`, `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`, and others. The focus should be on methods within these files that handle the pretty printing of vector objects, such as `_print_BasisDependent`, `_print_Cross`, `_print_Integral`, and others in the PrettyPrinter class.",

This suggests a problem with the pretty printing functionality from the sympy.printing.pretty module when handling vector and integral expressions. The search results reveal several relevant code spans:\n1. In 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', there are methods like _print_Cross, _print_Integral, and _print_BasisDependent, which handle the pretty printing of vector cross products, integrals, and basis-dependent expressions, respectively. These are directly relevant as they deal with the types of expressions involved in the reported bug.\n2. In 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py', methods such as _pretty, _latex, and _print_Derivative are found, which handle the pretty printing and LaTeX representation of vector expressions, including derivatives. This suggests that this file also contains code that influences how vector expressions are displayed.\n3. Additionally, 'sympy/physics/vector/printing.py' includes classes like VectorPrettyPrinter with methods _print_Derivative and _print_Function, which further support the theory that vector-specific printing methods are located here.\nGiven the presence of relevant methods in these files, it appears we have located the code sections that are directly responsible for the pretty printing of vector and related expressions, which should be further inspected to resolve the reported issue.",

The specific problem is that outputs get jumbled, with unit vectors appearing in the middle of the output. To address this, we need to focus on the printing methods for `Vector` objects and ensure that the unit vectors are correctly placed in the output.\n\nFrom the current file context, we have seen relevant code spans in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` and `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`. These spans include methods like `_latex`, `__rsub__`, and `_print_Derivative`, which are related to vector printing and manipulation.\n\nIn the new search results, additional relevant code spans are found across multiple files. In `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, the `_print_Cross` and `_print_Integral` methods are identified as potentially related to printing issues. In `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, the `_pretty` method is relevant as it deals with pretty printing of vectors. In `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`, methods like `_print_Derivative`, `_print_Function`, and `_pretty_Derivative` are important for handling the pretty printing of derivatives and functions, which are relevant to the issue.\n\nBy analyzing these methods, we can identify the code spans that are most relevant to the reported issue related to `pretty_print` with `sympy.vector` objects. These spans will help in understanding the flow of data and the specific areas where the output might be getting jumbled.\n\nThe identified spans include:\n- `_print_Cross` and `_print_Integral` in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`,\n- `_pretty` in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`,\n- `_print_Derivative`, `_print_Function`, and `_pretty_Derivative` in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`.\n\nThese spans cover the methods responsible for generating the pretty print output, which aligns directly with the reported issue. Therefore, they are identified as relevant code spans based on the reported issue. The identified spans provide a comprehensive view of where the issue might be occurring within the codebase.",

The issue specifically focuses on the output being jumbled when using pretty_print, especially with the code provided. By examining the code and output snippets, it's evident that the issue involves the rendering of vector expressions, particularly the placement of unit vectors. Next, I reviewed the current context focusing on files already identified as relevant, specifically in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py. The task identified the Vector class and its methods in sympy/physics/vector/vector.py as key elements to be reviewed. Moving to the new search results, I started with sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py. The file contains the PrettyPrinter class, which is crucial for the pretty printing of SymPy objects. Relevant spans include _print_Cross and _print_Integral methods, which handle the pretty printing of vector cross products and integrals, respectively. After analyzing, I identified that the _print_BasisDependent method specifically addresses the pretty printing of BasisDependent objects, likely including sympy.vector objects. Given this, I decided to include spans related to these methods as they appear to be directly relevant to the issue of pretty printing vector objects, particularly for handling the display of unit vectors and other vector components.",
