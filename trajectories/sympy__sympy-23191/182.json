The methods _print_BasisDependent and _hprint_vec in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' are especially relevant, as they handle the formatting of vector components and basis vectors. Additionally, the _pretty method in 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py' directly manages the pretty printing of Vector objects. Given the detailed structures and logic used in these methods, they are likely the focal points for addressing the issue of jumbled outputs during printing. Additional inspection of these methods, possibly with attention to how they handle the integration of components with basis vectors, may help pinpoint and resolve the display bug.",
