The search results lead to the `pretty.py` file within the `sympy/printing` module, which contains the `PrettyPrinter` class responsible for the pretty printing functionality. The method `_print_BasisDependent` within this class appears to handle the pretty printing of `BasisDependent` objects, which is likely the case for vector objects in `sympy.vector`. This method includes logic for formatting the output of vector components, which aligns well with the issue of the unit vectors being mispositioned in the terminal output.\n\nAnalyzing the method `_print_BasisDependent`, it can be seen that the method uses a combination of strings and prettyForm objects to construct the pretty printed output. The method checks for specific conditions like the presence of certain Unicode characters for fractions and adjusts the positioning of the basis vectors accordingly. Given the description of the issue and the relevant part of the code, it seems likely that the error in the terminal output involves mismanagement of these adjustments, possibly due to an issue in the logic that inserts spaces or aligns the components.\n\nThis method directly relates to the functionality being used in the reported issue, and therefore, any adjustments or fixes for the issue would need to be implemented or investigated here. Thus, the code span encapsulating the `_print_BasisDependent` method is highly relevant to address the reported issue.",
