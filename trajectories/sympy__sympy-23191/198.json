The main problem described is that the unit vector appears in the middle of the output, causing a jumble effect. To address this, we need to identify and potentially modify the code responsible for rendering these sympy.vector objects in the terminal. Currently, we have identified relevant files in the file context:\nsympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py - This file contains the PrettyPrinter class, which is responsible for pretty printing SymPy objects, including BasisDependent objects.\nsympy/physics/vector/printing.py - This file contains the VectorPrettyPrinter class, which extends the PrettyPrinter class specifically for vector objects.\n\nIn the search results, we have the same files being presented again but with more detailed code spans then in the file_context:\nsympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py - This file includes methods such as _print_Integral, _print_BasisDependent, handling integral expressions and basis dependent objects like vectors.\nsympy/physics/vector/printing.py - This file includes the _print_Derivative and _print_Function methods specific to vector printing.\n\nGiven the issue description about the jumbled display of sympy.vector object with pretty_print, it is crucial to focus on the methods dealing with basis dependent objects (_print_BasisDependent) and particularly at how the vectors are being formatted and rendered. We will check the methods related to basis dependent objects and vector printing to understand if there are issues related to the concatenation or styling that might lead to the jumbled output. This will involve reviewing the 'span_ids' for 'PrettyPrinter._print_BasisDependent' which is a paramount method used in prettifying BasisDependent objects, vectors for instance, and 'VectorPrettyPrinter._print_Derivative' which is commonly used for sympy.physics.vector printing.\nThe goal will be to identify if these existing methods need adjustment or potential enhancement to manage proper formatting or alignment when pretty printing vectors. The identified issues, closely linked to functions within these paths, indicate the necessary code spans to be examined for their involvement in creation or display of integrated symbolic expressions.",

Specifically, I identified sections related to the `PrettyPrinter` class and its methods `_print_Cross`, `_print_Integral`, and `_print_BasisDependent`. I also found methods in the `VectorPrettyPrinter` class that handle derivatives and functions concerning vector printing.
