The problem seems to be specific to how the vector objects are being printed, potentially due to the insertion of unit vectors in the middle of the output. Given the context and the code snippet provided, it's evident that the problem lies within the pretty printing methods of the vector objects and the handling of unit vectors. Therefore, it's crucial to investigate the pretty printing methods in the relevant files. Focus should be on the PrettyPrinter class and its specific methods for handling vector objects, such as _print_BasisDependent, _print_Cross, _print_Curl, etc., which are likely to be involved in the pretty printing of vector expressions. Additionally, the VectorPrettyPrinter class in sympy/physics/vector/printing.py is another critical area to examine, as it specializes in printing vector expressions.",

This issue suggests a problem in the pretty printing of vector and matrix operations in the terminal. The provided search results include several files and code spans, but the most relevant appears to be `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. This file contains the `PrettyPrinter` class, which includes methods for printing various mathematical objects, including vectors and matrices. Notably, the methods `_print_Cross`, `_print_Curl`, `_print_Divergence`, `_print_Dot`, and `_print_BasisDependent` are likely candidates for the issue, as they handle the pretty printing of vector and related operations. These methods manipulate the pretty print format for operations like cross products, curl, divergence, dot products, and basis-dependent objects, which could potentially cause the output to be jumbled or incorrectly formatted, aligning with the reported issue. The other file, `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`, also contains printer classes, but its focus seems to be more on physics-related vector printing functions, which might not directly address the issue in the same way as the `PrettyPrinter` class methods.",
