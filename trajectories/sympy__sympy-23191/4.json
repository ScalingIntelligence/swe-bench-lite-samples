This suggests a potential problem with the Pretty Printing functionality in sympy, specifically related to how vectors are handled. The relevant files and methods identified so far are mainly from the sympy/printing and sympy/physics/vector directories, focusing on methods like `_print_BasisDependent`, `_pretty`, and `_print_Integral`. To address the issue, we need to further investigate how the vector objects are processed during pretty printing.",

To address this, the relevant files and code spans should focus on the `pretty_print` functionality and how `sympy.vector` objects are handled during printing. The initial search results include several files and spans that are relevant to the printing of mathematical expressions and vectors, particularly in the context of LaTeX and pretty printing. The `LatexPrinter` and `MathMLPresentationPrinter` classes seem crucial, as they handle the printing of complex mathematical expressions, including vectors. Additionally, the `Vector` class and its methods for string and pretty representations in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` are directly related to the issue. The spans in these files that are most relevant include the methods for printing basis-dependent expressions and vectors, which are central to how unit vectors are displayed. By examining these spans, we can identify if there are issues in the formatting or concatenation of the string representations of vectors and whether unit vectors are being inserted improperly. However, the search results provided do not include all necessary spans; for instance, the start of the `LatexPrinter` and other methods related to the vector printing are missing, making it challenging to evaluate completeness accurately. To proceed, we should ensure that all parts of the code related to vector printing are available for analysis. Additionally, we should verify if there are any settings or configurations in `init_printing()` that might affect the display of vector objects.",

The sympy/physics/vector/vector.py contains the core Vector class with methods like _pretty, _latex, and _sympystr which seem crucial for this functionality. The search results provided additional context, specifically the methods in LatexPrinter for handling vector printing operations, which are pertinent to resolving the display issue.
