This suggests that the problem might be within the methods that handle pretty printing for vector objects in SymPy. The identified files (`pretty.py`, `vector.py`, `dyadic.py`, and `printing.py`) contain relevant classes and methods that handle pretty printing. The specific methods like `_print_BasisDependent`, `_print_Cross`, `_print_Integral`, and their counterparts in `VectorPrettyPrinter` should be investigated further for potential issues related to the placement of unit vectors during pretty printing.",
