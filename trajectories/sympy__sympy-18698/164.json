The example provided showcases the incorrect handling of factor multiplicity. To address this, it is crucial to identify the code spans responsible for the `sqf_list` functionality across different files in the SymPy codebase.\n\n1. **sympy/polys/polyclasses.py**: This file contains the `DMP` class, which includes the `sqf_list` method. This method is directly responsible for generating the square-free factorization list, making it a primary candidate for relevance.\n\n2. **sympy/polys/polytools.py**: Here, the `Poly` class also contains a `sqf_list` method, which is a wrapper around the `sqf_list` method of the `DMP` class. It enhances the functionality by converting the polynomial representation back into symbolic expressions. Additionally, the `_generic_factor_list` function is indirectly related to the `sqf_list` method, as it processes and validates the polynomial inputs.\n\n3. **sympy/polys/rings.py**: The `PolyElement` class includes a `sqf_list` method that calls into the ring's method for square-free factorization. This interaction between different classes highlights the complexity of the implementation and further emphasizes the need to investigate this span for potential inconsistencies.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the identified code spans across these files are the most relevant to the reported issue, as they directly handle or influence the behavior of the `sqf_list` function.",
