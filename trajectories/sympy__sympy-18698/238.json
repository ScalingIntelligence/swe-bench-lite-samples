            "scratch_pad": "After reviewing the updated context and the applied changes, it appears that the primary issue regarding the inconsistent factor multiplicity in the `sqf_list` method has been adequately addressed. The `dmp_sqf_list` function now correctly sorts the factors based on their degree, which ensures that the multiplicities are accurately represented. Given that the core functionality has been adjusted to handle and process the factors correctly, and the examples provided in the issue are now yielding the expected results, I am confident that the issue has been resolved.",
