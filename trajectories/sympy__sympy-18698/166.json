To resolve this, we need to locate the implementation of `sqf_list` and closely related functions to investigate how multiplicities are being calculated and ensure they are assigned correctly. Given the context provided, the `sqf_list` function is defined in several files within the sympy.polys module, including `polytools.py`, `galoistools.py`, `sqfreetools.py`, and `factortools.py`.

The provided search results contain relevant code spans that implement the `sqf_list` function in different classes and modules. The `Poly` class in `polytools.py` contains the main implementation of `sqf_list`, which utilizes methods from `PolyElement` in `rings.py` and `DMP` in `polyclasses.py`. These methods call lower-level factorization routines like `dmp_sqf_list`, suggesting that the issue might stem from these lower-level functions. Additionally, the `_generic_factor_list` function in `polytools.py` is involved in the factorization process and interacts with `sqf_list`. Reviewing these code spans is crucial to identify and potentially correct the inconsistency in handling polynomial factor multiplicity. By analyzing these spans, I can determine which parts of the code are directly responsible for the reported issue and ensure completeness in identifying the relevant code.",

The file context provided contains the `sympy/polys/polytools.py` file, which defines the `sqf_list` function within the `Poly` class. This function delegates the core logic to `f.rep.sqf_list(all)`, suggesting that the actual implementation is in a lower-level module or class. The `DMP` class in `sympy/polys/polyclasses.py` also has a `sqf_list` method, which further delegates to `dmp_sqf_list`. The `dmp_sqf_list` function is found in `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`, which contains the core logic for square-free factorization.
