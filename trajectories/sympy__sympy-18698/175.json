To address this issue, the relevant code spans should focus on functions and methods related to polynomial factorization, specifically those dealing with square-free factorization and handling of multiplicities. The search results provided include several potentially relevant functions, such as `dup_zz_factor_sqf`, `sqf_list` in various contexts, and related methods for handling polynomials.
