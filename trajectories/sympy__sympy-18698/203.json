Additionally, functions in `polytools.py` such as `_generic_factor_list`, `_torational_factor_list`, `sqf_list`, and `factor_list` are relevant as they handle the factorization logic.

In the search results, I found `dmp_sqf_list` in `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py` which appears to be directly involved in the computation of square-free factors. The search results also include utility functions in `sympy/polys/compatibility.py` and `sympy/polys/polytools.py` that could support the operations needed for `sqf_list`.
