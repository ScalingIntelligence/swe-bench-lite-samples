To address this, it's crucial to examine the relevant parts of the code that handle the factorization and aggregation of factors. The provided search results include the Poly class with a method sqf_list and another standalone function sqf_list, both of which seem relevant to the task of polynomial factorization. Additionally, the _generic_factor_list function also appears relevant as it is used by the sqf_list function to handle the factorization process.
