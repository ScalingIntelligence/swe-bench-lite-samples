The examples provided highlight incorrect factorizations in the output of `sqf_list`, specifically in the handling of factors and their multiplicities. To address this, it's necessary to identify the functions and code spans responsible for the `sqf_list` functionality. In the provided search results, several relevant code spans are identified: 1. `Poly.sqf_list` in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` - This is the main method for square-free factorization. 2. `sqf_list` also appears in `sympy/polys/rings.py` and `sympy/polys/polyclasses.py`, indicating implementations of square-free factorization at different levels in the polynomial manipulation hierarchy. These are likely to be the central implementations related to the issue. Further, the `factor_list` methods are also relevant as they perform similar factorization tasks which could influence the correctness of `sqf_list`. The presence of these methods in different modules underscores the complexity and distributed nature of SymPy's polynomial manipulation capabilities, reinforcing the need to maintain consistency across them. Thus, these identified spans are critical for diagnosing and potentially fixing the reported inconsistency.",
