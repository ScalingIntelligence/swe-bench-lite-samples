From `sympy/polys/galoistools.py`, the relevant span includes the `gf_sqf_list` function, which handles square-free factorization over finite fields.\n\nAnalyzing the new search results, there are additional key functions identified like `gf_quo`, `gf_gcd`, `gf_diff` from `sympy/polys/galoistools.py` and `dmp_sqf_list` from `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`, which are all directly related to polynomial operations including factorization, gcd, and differentiation.\n\nThese functions and methods are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue with the `sqf_list` function, especially in how it handles the factorization and the output of factor multiplicities.
