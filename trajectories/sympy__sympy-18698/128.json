Specifically, the output of sqf_list is not aligning correctly with the expected multiplicities of the factors. Step-by-step analysis of the code spans revealed that the function Poly.sqf_list and the lower-level functions involved in the sqf_list computation across multiple files like sympy/polys/galoistools.py, sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py, and sympy/polys/factortools.py are key to understanding and resolving the issue.
