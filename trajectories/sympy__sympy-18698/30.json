The `sqf_list` function is explicitly mentioned in `polytools.py`. To further pinpoint the issue, we need to investigate how multiplicity is handled in these files.",

The search results provide several relevant code spans across different files that focus on the functionality of square-free factorization (`sqf`) and related polynomial factorization techniques in the SymPy library. The files `sympy/polys/compatibility.py`, `sympy/polys/polytools.py`, `sympy/polys/galoistools.py`, `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`, and `sympy/polys/factortools.py` contain methods specifically designed for square-free factorization and related operations, which are highly relevant to solving the reported issue. Among these, methods like `IPolys.dup_sqf_norm`, `Poly.sqf_list`, `gf_sqf_list`, `dup_sqf_list`, and `dmp_sqf_list` are directly involved in the process of square-free decomposition of polynomials, making them crucial for addressing the inconsistencies reported in the issue. These methods capture the core logic used to determine the square-free part of polynomials and list their factors according to multiplicity, which directly relates to the issue at hand.",

Upon examination of the provided file context, we can observe that the `sqf_list` function is indeed defined in `polytools.py` and is referenced in other files such as `sqfreetools.py`, `factortools.py`. The code in these files handles various aspects related to square-free factorization, including the handling of multiplicities. Given the presence of code that deals with aspects such as `dup_sqf_norm`, `dup_gf_sqf_part`, `dup_sqf_part` in `compatibility.py`, as well as the presence of `sqf_list` in `polytools.py`, it seems likely that the relevant code is represented in the file context.

The identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of how `sqf_list` is implemented and how factors are handled. The search results include the implementations of `dup_sqf_list` and `dmp_sqf_list` which are crucial for understanding how the square-free factorization is computed for univariate and multivariate polynomials respectively. Additionally, the `gf_sqf_list` function is highlighted which deals with square-free factorization over finite fields, which is particularly relevant given the mixed usage of polynomials and Galois field operations in the reported issue. These code spans are directly related to the issue of consistent factor multiplicity in `sqf_list` and provide sufficient context to understand and potentially address the reported inconsistency.",
