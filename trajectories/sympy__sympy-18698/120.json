The provided example shows that the expected output for one polynomial includes a single factor of multiplicity 3, but the actual output includes two factors of multiplicity 3. This suggests an error in the handling of polynomial factorization in the `sqf_list` method. By analyzing the search results, we can see that the relevant code spans are primarily located in the `sympy/polys/polytools.py` and `sympy/polys/rings.py` files. These files contain the definitions and implementations of the `sqf_list` method, which is central to the reported issue. Additionally, the `sqf_part` and `factor_list` methods are also relevant, as they relate to polynomial factorization and may have similar underlying issues.
