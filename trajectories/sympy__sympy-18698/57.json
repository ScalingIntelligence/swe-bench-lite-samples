The issue provides examples where the `sqf_list` function returns incorrect results with multiple factors of the same multiplicity, whereas it correctly handles single-multiplicity factors. The analysis of the code spans provided in the search results reveals that the `sqf_list` function is defined in multiple places across different files, which suggests that the function might be implemented in a generic way that can lead to inconsistencies. Identifying the exact part of the code responsible for the discrepancy will require further investigation into how the factors are processed and returned by the `sqf_list` function. The spans related to `sqf_list` in the `sympy/polys/polytools.py` and `sympy/polys/polyclasses.py` files appear to be the most relevant to address the reported issue as they directly implement the `sqf_list` functionality. These sections may need to be examined to ensure that factors and their multiplicities are correctly handled.",
