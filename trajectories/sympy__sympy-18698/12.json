This appears to be related to how factors are combined and their multiplicities counted. The search results show multiple definitions of `sqf_list` in different modules, which suggests that the function is implemented across layers of the polynomial manipulation system in sympy. The `Poly.sqf_list` method in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` seems particularly relevant as it directly interfaces with the representation of polynomials and their factor lists. Similarly, `DMP.sqf_list` in `sympy/polys/polyclasses.py` is involved in the lower-level handling of polynomial representations and their sqf (square-free) factorization. Further, `PolyElement.sqf_list` in `sympy/polys/rings.py` abstracts these operations for specific polynomial rings. Given the issue's focus on the correctness of the raw factorization, all three of these implementations are pertinent to resolving the inconsistency.",

Additionally, the `_sorted_factors` function in `polytools.py` is used for sorting the factors, which might affect the order and multiplicity of the factors.
