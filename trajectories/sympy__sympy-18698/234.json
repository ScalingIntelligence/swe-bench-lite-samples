The example provided shows incorrect handling of multiplicity, which needs to be corrected. The relevant files mentioned in the context include `sympy/polys/polytools.py`, `sympy/polys/galoistools.py`, `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`, `sympy/polys/factortools.py`, and others. These files contain various functions related to polynomial operations, including factorization and square-free factorization. The specific functions of interest are `sqf_list`, `sqf`, and their related functions in these files. The goal is to locate the exact pieces of code where the inconsistency in handling multiplicity occurs, so the problem can be addressed.",

These files contain the necessary functions and methods to handle sqf operations, including `dup_sqf_list_include`, `dmp_sqf_list_include`, and the `IPolys` class methods for sqf operations.
