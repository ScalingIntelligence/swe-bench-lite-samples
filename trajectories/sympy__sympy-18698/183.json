The issue involves polynomials and their factorization in the sympy library. The most relevant files seem to be those in the sympy/polys/ directory, particularly those containing functions such as sqf_list, sqf, and factor_list. Also, considering the nature of the issue, functions handling square-free polynomials and their lists such as gf_sqf_list and dmp_sqf_list could be of interest. Therefore, the search should focus on these specific functions and the logic handling the factorization of polynomials.",

Specifically, the issue is that certain polynomials are being factored into multiple factors of the same degree when they should be considered as a single factor with a higher degree. For example, (x - 2)**3 and (x - 3)**3 are being treated as separate factors of degree 3, instead of a single factor of degree 6. I will analyze the provided search results to identify the relevant code spans that implement the `sqf_list` function and might be causing this inconsistency. The search results include implementations of `sqf_list` in different classes and modules such as `DMP`, ` Poly`, `PolyElement`, and functions in `polytools`, `compatibility`, `rings`, `galoistools`, and `sqfreetools`. I will focus on these spans to determine if they correctly handle the square-free factorization of polynomials, especially when dealing with multiple factors of the same degree.",

These functions are critical as they perform square-free factorization in different contexts (dense multi-variate polynomials and Galois fields, respectively). The implementation of these functions allows for an understanding of how polynomials are factored and how multiplicities are handled, which is central to resolving the issue.\n\nBy focusing on these key functions, it becomes possible to identify where the logic for determining the square-free factors and their multiplicities might be flawed, leading to incorrect results as reported in the issue.
