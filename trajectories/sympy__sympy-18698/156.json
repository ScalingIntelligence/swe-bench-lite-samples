Each of these methods is involved in the process of obtaining the square-free factorization, with the `Poly.sqf_list` and `DMP.sqf_list` methods directly handling the computation and formatting of the result. The `_generic_factor_list` function in `polytools.py` is also relevant as it is a more general function used for factorization that includes the specific case of square-free factorization.
