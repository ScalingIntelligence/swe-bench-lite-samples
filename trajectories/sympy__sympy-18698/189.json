The example provided highlights an incorrect assignment of multiplicity for factors. Specifically, the example shows that for a polynomial like `(x**2 + 1) * (x - 1)**2 * (x - 2)**3 * (x - 3)**3`, the expected output should list each factor with its correct multiplicity, but it does not. To address this, we need to investigate the `sqf_list` function and related functions like `sqf_part`, `factor_list`, and `gf_sqf_list` across the provided files. We should also look at any helper or utility functions that might contribute to the computation of these multiplicities.",
