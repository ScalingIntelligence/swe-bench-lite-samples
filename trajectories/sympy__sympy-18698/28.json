The example provided shows that the function does not correctly handle the multiplicity of factors, leading to incorrect outputs. To address this, we need to identify the parts of the code responsible for the `sqf_list` functionality. By analyzing the search results, we can see that there are three main files (`sympy/polys/polyclasses.py`, `sympy/polys/polytools.py`, and `sympy/polys/rings.py`) each containing versions of the `sqf_list` method. The first file implements the `sqf_list` method directly within the `DMP` class, while the second file includes the `sqf_list` function both as a method of the `Poly` class and as a standalone function. The third file includes a similar method in the `PolyElement` class. Given the issue's specific focus on the `sqf_list` function, all of these instances are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the inconsistency in the output.",
