This suggests that the `sqf_list` method might have an underlying issue in how it calculates the multiplicity of factors.\n\nIn the provided search results, several relevant code spans are found in `sympy/polys/polyclasses.py` and `sympy/polys/polytools.py` under the `DMP` and `Poly` classes, respectively. These spans include the definitions and implementations of `sqf_list` and `factor_list` methods. The issue seems to be directly related to the `sqf_list` method's logic, which should be thoroughly examined. Additionally, the `factor_list` method's definition and implementation are also relevant, as they might share common underlying logic or methods like `dmp_factor_list` that could also be contributing to the issue.\n\nThe `PolyElement` class in `sympy/polys/rings.py` also contains `sqf_list` and `factor_list` methods, indicating that these methods are core functionalities in the polynomial handling within the library. Their implementations should be reviewed for potential issues or inconsistencies.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue, making the search task complete.",

Specifically, the `sqf_list` method in `PolyClass` directly invokes the `dmp_sqf_list` function within the same file, and similarly, the `factor_list` method calls `dmp_factor_list`. The `Poly` class in `polytools.py` also has `sqf_list` and `factor_list` methods that interact with the representations of polynomials. Additionally, `sqf_list` and `factor_list` are referenced in helper functions and generic list factorizations.
