The example provided shows an incorrect output where the function returns two factors of the same polynomial with the same multiplicity, which should not happen based on the polynomial's factorization. The correct example demonstrates the proper handling of multiplicity in the factors.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are located in 'sympy/polys/polytools.py' and 'sympy/polys/polyclasses.py'. The 'sqf_list' function in 'polytools.py' is responsible for listing the square-free factors of a polynomial. It uses the 'dmp_sqf_list' function from 'polyclasses.py' to achieve this. Additionally, there is a generic factor list function '_generic_factor_list' in 'polytools.py' that deals with factorizing expressions. These functions handle the core logic of factorization and can be the source of the reported inconsistency.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, it is important to check the implementation of 'sqf_list' in both 'Poly' class and 'DMP' class to understand how the factors and their multiplicities are being processed. The '_generic_factor_list' function's handling of factors and factorization methods is also crucial for the overall functionality that might be causing the inconsistency.",
