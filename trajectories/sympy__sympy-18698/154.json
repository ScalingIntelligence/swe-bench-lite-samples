The relevant code spans in the search results are those that contain the implementation of 'sqf_list'. In 'polyclasses.py', there is a method 'sqf_list' within the 'DMP' class that handles the square-free factorization. Similarly, in 'polytools.py', the 'Poly' class has a method 'sqf_list' that seems to delegate the operation to the 'rep' object if it has such a method. There's also a top-level function 'sqf_list' that calls a generic factor list function, which could be involved in handling the input provided in the issue. In 'rings.py', the 'PolyElement' class also has a 'sqf_list' method, indicating that this method is critical for the square-free factorization functionality. These code spans are likely directly related to the functionality of producing the square-free list of factors, which forms the core of the reported issue. Therefore, identifying these code spans as relevant will help address the inconsistency mentioned in the reported issue.",
