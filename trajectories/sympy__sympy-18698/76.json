The examples provided show incorrect factor multiplicities in one case and correct factor multiplicities in another. The search results contain several relevant code spans, particularly those defining methods related to `sqf_list` across different classes in the sympy.polys module. The `DMP` class in `polyclasses.py`, the `Poly` class in `polytools.py`, and the `PolyElement` class in `rings.py` all have methods named `sqf_list`. These methods appear to be central to the functionality of generating square-free factor lists, making them highly relevant to the reported issue. Specifically, the `sqf_list` method in the `DMP` class converts factors into a specific format, and the `sqf_list` method in the `Poly` class handles the conversion of these factors into symbolic form. The `sqf_list` method in `PolyElement` delegates the task to the ring's method for square-free factorization. These methods should be inspected further to pinpoint the source of the inconsistency.",
