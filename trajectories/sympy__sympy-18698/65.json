The new search results reveal an additional method, `sqf_part`, which is related to square-free factorization but focuses on retrieving the square-free part of a polynomial rather than listing its factors. Given the issue's focus on `sqf_list`, the relevant code span appears to be the implementation of `sqf_list` within the `Poly` class.
