The example provided wrongly lists the factors with their multiplicities, indicating a potential bug in the `sqf_list` function or its dependencies. Given the context, it's crucial to investigate the `sqf_list` function in the `polytools.py` file and its related functions and modules such as `galoistools.py`, `sqfreetools.py`, and `factortools.py`. Focus should be on functions like `sqf_list`, `gf_sqf_list`, `dmp_gf_sqf_list`, and related ones that handle square-free factorization. This should help identify where the inconsistency arises.",

Looking through the search results, I identified relevant code spans in the 'sympy/polys/polyclasses.py', 'sympy/polys/polytools.py', and 'sympy/polys/rings.py' files that directly implement or call the 'sqf_list' function. These spans include the 'DMP.sqf_list', 'Poly.sqf_list', and 'PolyElement.sqf_list' methods. These methods are responsible for computing the square-free factors of polynomials, and they match the functionality described in the reported issue.
