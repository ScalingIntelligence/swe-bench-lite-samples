The provided search results include multiple spans from various files related to the `Poly` class and its methods, specifically focusing on the `sqf_list` and `factor_list` methods. The relevant spans in `polytools.py` are those defining the `sqf_list` method for the `Poly` class and the generic `sqf_list` function, as they are directly involved in the factorization process. Additionally, the `sqf_list` methods in `rings.py` and `polyclasses.py` are relevant as they handle the computation of the square-free factorization for polynomial elements and dense multivariate polynomials, respectively. These spans are critical for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior to address the reported inconsistency.
