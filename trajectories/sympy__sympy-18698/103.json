The issue indicates that the output does not correctly reflect the multiplicity of the factors. Upon examining the search results, it is apparent that the function `sqf_list` is central to resolving this issue. Three main occurrences of the `sqf_list` function are identified in different files: `sympy/polys/polytools.py`, `sympy/polys/polyclasses.py`, and `sympy/polys/rings.py`. These functions handle the factorization process and are directly involved in producing the output that is in question.

Secondly, exploring _generic_factor_list in polytools.py, which is a utility function used by sqf_list to handle the factorization generically across various types of expressions.

Specifically, the example shows that the function is returning two factors of multiplicity 3 instead of one factor of multiplicity 2. The issue is related to the `sqf_list` function and its underlying implementations. The current context provides implementations of `sqf_list` in `Poly`, `DMP`, and `PolyElement` classes as well as the generic factor list function. The new search results include additional implementations of `sqf_list` in `dmp_sqf_list` and `dup_sqf_list` functions, which are likely the core logic handling the square-free factorization. These new spans are relevant because they provide the actual algorithmic implementations for the `sqf_list` functionality, which is directly related to the reported issue. The `_sorted_factors` function is also relevant as it sorts the factors, which might be part of the issue if the sorting logic is not accounting for multiplicities correctly.",

These functions are responsible for breaking down polynomials into their irreducible factors, which aligns with the examples given in the reported issue. Additionally, the _generic_factor_list function in polytools.py, which is used by sqf_list, also provides the necessary context for understanding how factorization is handled generically across different polynomial representations.
