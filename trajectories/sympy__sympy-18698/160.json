The example provided shows the expected output as (x*_2 - 5_x + 6, 3) but receives 2 factors of multiplicity 3 instead. This inconsistency needs to be addressed by reviewing the relevant functions and classes that deal with square-free factorization, particularly focusing on the handling of factor multiplicities. The files provided in the context contain potential locations where the issue might lie, such as functions named 'sqf_list', 'sqf_part', and others. These functions are likely to be found in modules like 'polytools.py', 'galoistools.py', 'sqfreetools.py', and 'factortools.py'. Investigate these functions to ensure correct handling of multiplicities.",

The issue specifically points out errors in the multiplicity of factors in the output of `sqf_list`. The provided context of the `sympy/polys/polytools.py` file reveals code spans related to `Poly` class methods and implementations of square-free factorization methods such as `sqf_list` and `sqf_part`. These spans are crucial because they deal directly with the algorithm for retrieving square-free factors of a polynomial. Following this, the new search results further contribute necessary components: \n\n1. `sympy/polys/galoistools.py` includes `gf_sqf_list`, which manages square-free factorization over finite fields, related to potential numerical issues affecting factorization. \n2. `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py` has implementations specific to square-free factorization in different contexts, including `dup_sqf_list` and `dmp_sqf_list_include`, essential for understanding the overarching structure of how square-free factorization is achieved within the sympy.polys module.\n3. `sympy/polys/factortools.py` plays an instrumental role with `dup_factor_list_include` and other factorization methods. Errors in how factors are listed or their multiplicities assigned would likely stem from these high-level factor management functions.\n\nIn conclusion, integrating all these spans will provide a comprehensive understanding of the square-free factorization and necessary modifications for achieving a consistent output.",
