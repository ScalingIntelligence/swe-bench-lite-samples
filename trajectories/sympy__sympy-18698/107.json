Furthermore, the `_generic_factor_list` function integrates these functionalities to produce the final factored list, which is used by `sqf_list`.

To address this, it's crucial to review and potentially modify the `_sorted_factors` function, which determines the order and grouping of factors, and the `_generic_factor_list` function, which uses this sorting logic. Additionally, the `sqf_list` function itself should be checked to ensure it correctly uses the generic factor list function with the 'sqf' method. In the provided search results, the `_sorted_factors` and `_generic_factor_list` functions appear again, reinforcing their relevance to the issue at hand.
