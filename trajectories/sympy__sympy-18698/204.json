The example provided shows an incorrect output where it seems the function erroneously treats multiple factors with the same exponent as individual factors, while a correct output example demonstrates proper handling of factors with their respective exponents. To address this issue, I analyzed the code spans provided in the search results, focusing specifically on the 'sqf_list' method within the 'Poly' class and the '_generic_factor_list' function, as these are directly involved in computing the square-free factorization list. The 'sqf_list' method within the 'Poly' class is particularly relevant as it interfaces with the underlying representation of polynomials to perform the factorization. The '_generic_factor_list' function also plays a crucial role in processing the polynomial expression and handling the factors. Therefore, these two code spans seem pertinent to resolving the reported issue concerning the inconsistent outputs from 'sqf_list'.",
