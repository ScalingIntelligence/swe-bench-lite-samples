The output of `sqf_list` should list factors of a polynomial with their multiplicities correctly, but in some cases, it seems to be listing the same factor multiple times with different multiplicities, which is incorrect. It's likely that the issue is within the implementation of `sqf_list` or related functions in the `sympy.polys` module. To pinpoint the exact location of the issue, I will search for the `sqf_list` function and related classes or functions in the `sympy.polys` module.",

The search results provide implementations of `sqf_list` in three different classes: `DMP`, `Poly`, and `PolyElement`. Each of these classes contains a method named `sqf_list`, which is likely responsible for the functionality described in the issue. Given the issue's description, it is crucial to inspect these methods for any discrepancies or logic errors that might lead to the reported inconsistency. Additionally, the `_generic_factor_list` function in `polytools.py` is also relevant as it is called by the global `sqf_list` function. This function handles the factorization of polynomials and may include the logic that is failing to correctly compute the multiplicity of factors. By focusing on these specific sections of code, we can identify the root cause of the problem and ensure that the solution is both comprehensive and accurate.",
