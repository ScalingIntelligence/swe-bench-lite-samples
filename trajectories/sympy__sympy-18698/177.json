The inconsistency is about the multiplicity of factors in the output.

The relevant files identified in the context include various Python files from the `sympy/polys` directory, which are known to contain functions related to polynomial operations, factorization, and square-free factorization. Specifically, functions like `sqf_list`, `sqf_part`, and others in `polytools.py`, `factortools.py`, `galoistools.py`, and `sqfreetools.py` are likely to be involved.

The examples provided illustrate situations where the output shows multiple factors with the same multiplicity, which is incorrect according to the user. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the computation and formatting of square-free factorizations (sqf). From the search results, several key functions are identified, including `Poly.sqf_list`, `sqf_list`, and `_generic_factor_list`. These functions are directly responsible for generating the square-free factorization lists and handling the factors' multiplicities. Additionally, `_symbolic_factor_list` and `_generic_factor` might also be relevant as they handle symbolic factorization and could influence the output format. The identified spans should be examined to ensure they correctly handle and output the factor multiplicities.",
