From the provided search results, the following code spans are identified as relevant: 'sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py' spans for 'dup_sqf_list' and 'dmp_sqf_list' functions, 'sympy/polys/polytools.py' for 'sqf_list' and 'Poly.sqf_list', 'sympy/polys/compatibility.py' for imports related to sqf_list operations, 'sympy/polys/polyclasses.py' for 'DMP.sqf_list', and 'sympy/polys/rings.py' for 'PolyElement.sqf_list'.
