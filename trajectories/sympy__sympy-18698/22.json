Specifically, it points out that the function incorrectly computes the multiplicity of factors in certain cases. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the computation of square-free factorization and the handling of factor multiplicities. The provided search results contain several files and code spans related to polynomial manipulation in SymPy. From the analysis, the relevant files appear to be 'sympy/polys/polytools.py' and 'sympy/polys/polyclasses.py', as they contain definitions and implementations of the 'sqf_list' function. The 'Poly.sqf_list' and 'DMP.sqf_list' methods are particularly relevant as they directly involve the computation and return of square-free factors and their multiplicities. The '_generic_factor_list' function in 'sympy/polys/polytools.py' is also relevant as it processes the input for factorization methods including 'sqf_list'. The 'PolyElement.sqf_list' in 'sympy/polys/rings.py' is less directly related but could be part of the method resolution order when calling 'sqf_list' on a polynomial. Given the reported issue, focusing on the actual computation and return of factors in 'sympy/polys/polytools.py' and 'sympy/polys/polyclasses.py' is the priority.",
