The examples provided show an incorrect output for certain polynomials and a correct output for others, suggesting a potential bug in the handling of the `sqf_list` function. Given the nature of the issue, it's crucial to investigate the implementation of `sqf_list` and related functions across various modules. Relevant files include those from the `sympy.polys` package, as they directly deal with polynomial operations and factorization. Specifically, the `polytools.py`, `galoistools.py`, `sqfreetools.py`, and `factortools.py` modules are likely to contain the necessary code to resolve this issue.",
