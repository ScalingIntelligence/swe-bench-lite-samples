The provided example incorrectly lists the polynomial as having two factors of multiplicity 3, whereas it should have one factor each with multiplicity 2 and 3. This discrepancy suggests an underlying issue in how the `sqf_list` function determines and groups factors.\n\nThe search results include multiple relevant spans related to the `sqf_list` function: \n1. The `Poly.sqf_list` method defines the `sqf_list` functionality within the `Poly` class, handling the representation conversion and factor extraction.\n2. The `_generic_factor_list` function is a generic method for factor list generation, which `sqf_list` utilizes to process expressions, ensuring they are polynomials and handling their factorization into factors and their multiplicities.\n3. The standalone `sqf_list` function at the module level acts as a public interface for using the `_generic_factor_list` with a specific method type.\n\nThese three spans are directly related to the reported issue, as they cover the main implementation and interface of the `sqf_list` function. Therefore, these spans are identified as relevant to the issue at hand.",

The issue specifically points out an error in the output of sqf_list when there are factors with higher multiplicities, suggesting that the factors are not being handled correctly. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Understand the Issue**: The issue describes incorrect handling of factors with multiplicities greater than 1 in the sqf_list function. The example provided shows that instead of having a single factor of multiplicity 3, there are 2 factors each of multiplicity 3.\n\n2. **Review the Current Context**: The provided file context points to sympy/polys/polytools.py, which contains the implementation of the sqf_list function. This function is a wrapper around _generic_factor_list with the method set to 'sqf'. The function _sorted_factors is responsible for sorting the factors, and it uses a key function that includes the factor's polynomial representation and the exponent.\n\n3. **Analyze New Search Results**: The new search results flesh out more detailed implementations in sympy/polys/factortools.py and sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py, which handle specific factorization methods like Zassenhaus and factorization over finite fields. These are likely relevant because the issue could arise from how factors are processed or combined during the factorization process.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Code Spans**: The spans within sympy/polys/factortools.py (like dup_zz_zassenhaus, dup_zz_factor_sqf) and sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py (like dup_gf_sqf_list, dmp_gf_sqf_list) are likely relevant as they handle the actual factorization logic and could be contributing to the issue. Additionally, since the issue involves multiplicities and factor listings, the span for _sorted_factors remains relevant for ensuring that factors are listed correctly.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: By focusing on these specific function implementations and the sorting mechanisms for factors, we can better understand and potentially resolve the issue with sqf_list output being inconsistent due to incorrect factor multiplicities.",

The current file context shows the `sqf_list` method within the Poly class and other related functions like `_sorted_factors` and `_generic_factor_list`. The new search results also include `_sorted_factors` and `_generic_factor_list`, which are likely involved in the sorting and processing of the factors.
