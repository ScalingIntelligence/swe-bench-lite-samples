The issue specifically points out that the function is not correctly identifying the unique square-free factors of a polynomial and their respective multiplicities. The primary focus should be on the 'sqf_list' method in both the 'Poly' class and the 'DMP' class, as these are the direct handlers for generating the square-free factorization list. Additionally, the '_generic_factor_list' function should also be inspected, as it likely plays a role in how factors are processed and represented. Given the detailed error report, it is crucial to carefully review the logic within these methods to ensure that each factor's multiplicity is accurately calculated and represented in the final output. The file paths provided (sympy/polys/polytools.py and sympy/polys/polyclasses.py) are correctly identified as relevant to the issue, and the specific span IDs that pertain to 'sqf_list' functions in these files are marked for closer inspection.",
