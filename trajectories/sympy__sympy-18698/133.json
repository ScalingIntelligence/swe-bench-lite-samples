The examples provided in the issue demonstrate inconsistencies in the output of `sqf_list`. Given this, the initial search focused on identifying implementations of `sqf_list`. In the search results, several relevant spans of code are found in different files of the sympy library, particularly in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` and `sympy/polys/polyclasses.py`. These spans include the definition of `sqf_list` method in the `Poly` class and the `DMP` class, indicating that this method is a key component for handling square-free factorization in the library. Additionally, other related functions and methods like `sqf_norm`, `sqf_part`, `gff_list`, and sorting functions are also identified as potentially relevant context for understanding and addressing the reported issue.",

Specifically, the issue points out that the result for certain polynomials is not as expected in terms of the multiplicity of their factors. This suggests a potential bug or incorrect implementation in the `sqf_list` method. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that directly implement or support the `sqf_list` functionality.\n\nThe provided context already includes several relevant spans from the `sympy.polys.polytools` and `sympy.polys.polyclasses` modules, which contain the `Poly` class and its `sqf_list` method, as well as the `DMP` class and its `sqf_list` method. These are crucial for understanding the implementation of the `sqf_list` function.\n\nIn the new search results, we see additional occurrences of the `sqf_list` method under `Poly` and `DMP` classes, confirming their importance in addressing the issue. Additionally, spans related to `sqf_norm` and `sqf_part` are included, which may also be relevant as they could impact the `sqf_list` functionality.\n\nGiven the specificity of the issue to the `sqf_list` method, the identified spans appear to be directly related to the problem. The `Poly.sqf_list` and `DMP.sqf_list` methods are the main focus as they handle the functionality in question. Other spans such as `sqf_norm` and `sqf_part` could be indirectly relevant as they might impact the calculation or normalization within `sqf_list`.",

The next step should focus on analyzing the interaction between these methods, particularly how they process and interpret the multiplicities of factors.
