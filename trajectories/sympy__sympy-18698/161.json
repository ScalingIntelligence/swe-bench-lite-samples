Specifically, the example provided demonstrates an incorrect output where the polynomial (x**2 - 5*x + 6) should have one factor of multiplicity 3, but instead, the output shows two factors of multiplicity 3. The correct output is shown in a separate example where one factor of multiplicity 2 is correctly displayed.\n\nTo address this issue, it's important to analyze the `sqf_list` function and its related components to understand how the square-free factorization is being computed and returned. The search results include several relevant code spans:\n\n1. `sympy/polys/polytools.py` contains the `Poly.sqf_list` method which calls `f.rep.sqf_list(all)` and converts the results to symbolic form.\n2. `sympy/polys/galoistools.py` includes `gf_sqf_list`, which handles square-free factorization over finite fields.\n3. `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py` contains `dup_sqf_list` and `dmp_sqf_list`, which are likely to be the core functions for computing square-free factorizations over different domains.\n4. `sympy/polys/factortools.py` and `sympy/polys/compatibility.py` contain imports and utility functions that may be relevant but are less directly related to the core logic of `sqf_list`.\n\nBased on the issue description and the search results, the most relevant code spans to investigate further are those in `sympy/polys/polytools.py` (`Poly.sqf_list` and `sqf_list`), `sympy/polys/galoistools.py` (`gf_sqf_list`), and `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py` (`dup_sqf_list` and `dmp_sqf_list`).\n\nThese spans contain the main logic for computing square-free factorizations and converting them to the appropriate output format, making them the most relevant to resolve the reported issue.",
