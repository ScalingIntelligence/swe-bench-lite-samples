The provided example demonstrates that the output should have (x*_2 - 5_x + 6, 3) instead of 2 factors of multiplicity 3. This suggests a potential bug or incorrect logic in the `sqf_list` function. From the search results, it's evident that the `sqf_list` function is implemented in both `sympy/polys/polytools.py` and `sympy/polys/rings.py`. In `polytools.py`, the function `sqf_list` within the `Poly` class handles the conversion to symbolic representation, while the generic factor list function `_generic_factor_list` is responsible for the actual factorization and could be the location of the bug. In `rings.py`, the `sqf_list` method within the `PolyElement` class delegates the task to `dmp_sqf_list`, which indicates that the core logic might be implemented in the domain-specific polynomial functions. Therefore, both files and the specific spans identified should be further investigated to ensure the correct handling of multiplicity.",
