The issue example shows that the function incorrectly outputs factors with higher multiplicities than expected. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans where the 'sqf_list' function is defined and implemented. From the search results, I see that the 'sqf_list' function is defined in multiple files, specifically in 'sympy/polys/polytools.py', 'sympy/polys/rings.py', and 'sympy/polys/polyclasses.py'. These files contain the necessary code spans that deal with the functioning and computation related to the 'sqf_list' function. By identifying these spans, I can pinpoint the exact locations within the codebase that handle the square-free factorization and are thereby relevant to solving the reported issue. This will enable further investigation into the inconsistencies observed in the output.",
