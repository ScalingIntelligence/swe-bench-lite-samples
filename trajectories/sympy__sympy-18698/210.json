The example provided highlights an incorrect result where multiple factors have the same multiplicity, which should not be the case. This issue suggests that there is a bug in the implementation of the `sqf_list` function or its underlying methods. Upon reviewing the search results, it is evident that the `sqf_list` method is defined in multiple files (sympy/polys/polyclasses.py and sympy/polys/polytools.py) and is the primary focus of the reported issue. Analyzing the code spans, it appears that the `DMP.sqf_list` and `Poly.sqf_list` methods are directly related to the functionality described in the issue. Additionally, the `_generic_factor_list` function in sympy/polys/polytools.py plays a role in the factorization process, which is a part of `sqf_list`. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant and likely where the error is occurring. Further investigation into the implementations of `dmp_sqf_list` and `_symbolic_factor_list` would be necessary to identify the root cause of the issue.",

Given this information, it's crucial to inspect the `dmp_sqf_list` function used within the `DMP` class and the `_symbolic_factor_list` function, which is instrumental in the symbolic factorization process.

The issue suggests that the function is incorrectly grouping factors with the same multiplicity together, instead of correctly identifying each unique factor with its respective multiplicity. Given the context from the provided <file_context>, it's evident that the sqf_list methods of both the DMP (sympy/polys/polyclasses.py) and Poly (sympy/polys/polytools.py) classes are involved in the calculation of square-free factorization lists. The search results included implementations of sqf_list in IPolys (sympy/polys/compatibility.py) and detailed functions in sqfreetools.py for both dup and dmp versions. These all contribute to the square-free factorization functionality. The relevance of these spans is high as they directly process polynomials and their factors, which is the core of the reported issue. Additionally, the _sorted_factors function in polytools.py is crucial for final output formatting, ensuring the factors are sorted based on the method used, which directly impacts the consistency of the output. Therefore, these spans are highly relevant to the reported issue.",
