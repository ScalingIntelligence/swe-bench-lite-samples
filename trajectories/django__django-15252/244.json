The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder does not correctly adhere to the allow_migrate rules specified in the router, leading to the creation of tables in databases where they should not be created. To address this, focus should be on the MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and ConnectionRouter classes, as well as methods related to applying migrations and ensuring the schema. The search should be scoped to these specific concerns to identify the exact spots of discrepancy and potential fixes.",

Specifically, it points out that the MigrationRecorder creates tables in databases other than the 'default' one, which is against the expected behavior. The key methods involved in this process include `record_applied`, `ensure_schema`, and `has_table` in the MigrationRecorder class. The issue also implicates the MigrationExecutor's `migrate` method, which uses the MigrationRecorder to apply migrations. By analyzing the provided code spans, it is clear that the relevant methods from the MigrationRecorder are present in the search results. However, there is no explicit handling or checking of the db_router's `allow_migrate` rules within these methods before performing database actions. This suggests that the current implementation does not align with the expected behavior described in the issue. Therefore, the search task is not yet complete, as the identified code spans do not address the issue's root cause concerning the db_router rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
