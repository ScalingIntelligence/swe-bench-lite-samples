The provided search results include code spans from three files: django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/migrations/executor.py, and django/db/utils.py. From the django/db/migrations/recorder.py file, the MigrationRecorder class and its methods (specifically ensure_schema) are relevant as they deal with schema creation and migration recording. In the django/db/migrations/executor.py file, the MigrationExecutor class and its apply_migration method are important as they call the MigrationRecorder to apply migrations. Lastly, in django/db/utils.py, the ConnectionRouter and its allow_migrate method are relevant as they handle the routing logic for database operations. These spans provide a detailed overview of how migrations are applied and recorded, which is crucial for solving the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
