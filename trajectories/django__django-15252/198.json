To address this, we need to look into how the MigrationRecorder handles schema operations and migrations. Focusing on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods (`ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, etc.), we should also consider the interaction with the MigrationExecutor and the ConnectionRouter. Given the multifaceted nature of this issue, it might be beneficial to search for specific mentions of 'MigrationRecorder', 'allow_migrate', and the relevant methods in those classes to pinpoint the problematic behavior.",

The key concern is the behavior of the ensure_schema method in the MigrationRecorder class, which creates the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist. Given this, the most relevant code spans are those within the MigrationRecorder class, particularly ensure_schema, record_applied, record_unapplied, and has_table methods. These methods are responsible for tracking and recording migrations, which should adhere to the router's rules. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py is relevant because it is where the allow_migrate method is defined and used to control migration actions based on the router configurations. Lastly, the MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py involves the execution of migrations and interacts with the MigrationRecorder, making it relevant to understanding the full context of the issue at hand.",

Specifically, it points out that the 'ensure_schema' method of the MigrationRecorder class is not respecting these rules when it checks for or creates the 'django_migrations' table. This table should only be created on the 'default' database according to the custom Router class provided. The current implementation of 'ensure_schema' does not consult the router and directly checks or creates the table on any connection. The search results include relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' and 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py'. These spans are pertinent because they show how migrations are applied and how test databases are created, which directly relates to the reported issue about the enforcement of 'allow_migrate' rules during migrations. The identified spans provide a comprehensive view of the migration process and how the 'MigrationExecutor' interacts with the 'MigrationRecorder'.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
