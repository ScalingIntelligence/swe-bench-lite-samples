The primary areas of concern are the MigrationRecorder's behavior in ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied methods. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration and record_migration methods, and the underlying db connection handling and routing mechanisms are relevant. To address this, we should focus our search on the MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and ConnectionRouter classes within the django/db/migrations and django/db/utils directories.",

The key elements of the issue are the methods record_applied, record_unapplied, ensure_schema, and applied_migrations in the MigrationRecorder class, as well as the interactions within the MigrationExecutor class that call these methods. The search results reveal critical code spans that directly address these concerns. These spans include the constructor of MigrationRecorder, the migration_qs property, has_table, ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied methods. Furthermore, the MigrationExecutor class's methods such as __init__, apply_migration, record_migration, and unapply_migration are likely relevant due to their interaction with the MigrationRecorder. The ConnectionRouter class's allow_migrate and allow_migrate_model are also pertinent as they define the router logic described in the issue. Upon reviewing all code spans, it appears that the search has successfully uncovered significant code segments that pertain to the reported issue, indicating that the task can proceed with these findings.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
