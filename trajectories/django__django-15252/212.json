The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder is attempting to create tables on databases other than the 'default' one, which deviates from the allow_migrate rules set by the router. To address this, we need to identify the places in the code where the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database and ensure that it adheres to the router's rules. Specifically, we should focus on the methods ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied within the MigrationRecorder class, as well as the apply_migration method in the MigrationExecutor class.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the MigrationRecorder class not obeying the db_router's allow_migrate rules, specifically when creating the 'django_migrations' table on non-'default' databases. The analysis focused on the MigrationRecorder class from 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and the MigrationExecutor class from 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. Key methods identified in 'recorder.py' include 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', 'record_unapplied', and 'applied_migrations', all of which could potentially create or modify the 'django_migrations' table if not handled properly. In 'executor.py', methods like 'migrate', 'apply_migration', and 'unapply_migration' interact with the MigrationRecorder, indicating potential points where the allow_migrate rules could be violated. These methods are crucial for understanding how migrations are applied and recorded across different databases. The search results provide a comprehensive view of the code responsible for migration recording and execution, which is directly relevant to the reported issue of the MigrationRecorder not obeying db_router rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
