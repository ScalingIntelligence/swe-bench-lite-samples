The main focus should be on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods such as ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods like apply_migration and record_migration should be checked. The ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method are also relevant. The search should prioritize files in the django/db/migrations/ directory and django/db/utils.py to ensure all relevant parts of the migration and connection handling are reviewed.",

In `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class interacts with the `MigrationRecorder` and ensures schema before applying migrations. This could be a crucial part where the `allow_migrate` rules need to be considered.\n2. The `MigrationExecutor.apply_migration` method records migrations after applying them, which is directly related to the issue of recording migrations on the wrong database.\n3. In `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, the `MigrationRecorder` class has methods like `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` which are directly responsible for managing the schema and recording migration status. This is the core part of the problem where the router's rules must be obeyed.\n4. The `django/db/utils.py` file contains the `ConnectionRouter` class, which includes methods for routing and the `allow_migrate` method which should be invoked to ensure correct database routing.\n\nBased on the issue report and the provided search results, I identified the relevant code spans that would be crucial to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
