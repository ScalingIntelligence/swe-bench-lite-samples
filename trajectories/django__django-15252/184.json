The primary concern is that the MigrationRecorder should not create tables on connections other than the 'default' one as per the router's rules. The provided search results include key components that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. The 'MigrationRecorder' class and its methods such as 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', 'record_unapplied', and 'applied_migrations'. These methods are critical as they handle the creation and management of the migration history table 'django_migrations'.\n\n2. The 'MigrationExecutor' class, which interacts with the 'MigrationRecorder' to apply and unapply migrations. This class uses the recorder to record migration states, which should also adhere to the router's 'allow_migrate' rules.\n\n3. The 'ConnectionRouter' class and its 'allow_migrate' method, which determine if a migration should be allowed on a specific database. This class is central to implementing the desired routing behavior.\n\nThese components seem to cover the essential parts of the codebase related to handling migrations and their application across different databases. The key spans identified are those that either directly interact with the database or influence the decision of whether to migrate a database.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
