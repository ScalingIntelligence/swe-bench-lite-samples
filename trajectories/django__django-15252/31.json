Specifically, it's expected that the `MigrationRecorder` would respect the `allow_migrate` rule defined in the router and not create tables in databases other than the 'default' one. The problem seems to be that `MigrationRecorder`'s `ensure_schema` method attempts to create a table in all connections, regardless of the router's rules. To address this, we need to focus on the `MigrationRecorder` class and its interactions with the database router. Given the provided context, we should search for the `MigrationRecorder` class and any mention of `allow_migrate` to identify where and how the logic might be going wrong.",

The code spans provided include relevant sections from both django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/utils.py. In recorder.py, the MigrationRecorder class and its methods ensure_schema and record_applied are central to the issue, as they handle the creation of the migration table and recording of applied migrations. Notably, ensure_schema directly interacts with the database schema, which is crucial for the reported problem. In utils.py, the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method are relevant as they implement the logic for deciding whether to allow migrations on a given database. These sections together provide a comprehensive view of how the migration recording and routing are implemented in Django, allowing for a clear understanding of the potential issue with the MigrationRecorder not respecting the router's allow_migrate rules. Given this analysis, the identified code spans appear to be relevant to the issue described in the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
