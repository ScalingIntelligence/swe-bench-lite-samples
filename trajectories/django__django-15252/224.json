Specifically, when running functional tests, the migrate command is called against each connection, and the MigrationRecorder tries to create tables on non-'default' connections. The search should focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly ensure_schema, record_applied, applied_migrations, and record_unapplied, to identify where the behavior diverges from the expected behavior based on the db_router configuration. Additionally, related functions in the MigrationExecutor and BaseDatabaseCreation classes should be examined, as these are involved in the migration process and test database creation, respectively.",

The relevant code spans are primarily located in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, where the MigrationRecorder class methods are defined, including ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied. These methods handle the creation and recording of migration states, which may not respect the allow_migrate rules as per the user's expectation. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py is relevant as it uses MigrationRecorder and applies migrations, potentially leading to table creation on non-'default' connections. Lastly, the BaseDatabaseCreation class in django/db/backends/base/creation.py is involved in the creation of test databases, which might inadvertently trigger migrations and table creations on all connections. The identified code spans highlight the points where checks against the db router's allow_migrate might be missing or insufficient, leading to the observed issue.",

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
