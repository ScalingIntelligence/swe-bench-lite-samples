Specifically, the MigrationRecorder should respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules, but it currently does not, leading to tables being created in non-'default' databases. The problem lies in the `ensure_schema` method of MigrationRecorder, which checks if the Migration model is in the tables of the connection and attempts to create the table if it is not found. This action violates the expected behavior defined by the custom router. To address this, we need to investigate the implementation of `ensure_schema` in django/db/migrations/recorder.py and how it interacts with the connection router. Additionally, we should also inspect other methods like `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` in MigrationRecorder to ensure they are not causing similar issues.",

The issue is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules, leading to tables being created in non-default databases. To address this, we need to focus on the methods within the MigrationRecorder class that interact with the database schema and migration records. The key methods to examine are ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied. The ensure_schema method checks for the existence of the Migration table and creates it if it doesn't exist, which is where the issue lies. Additionally, applied_migrations and record_applied also interact with the database schema without considering the router's allow_migrate rules. The identified code spans in django/db/migrations/recorder.py cover these areas and are relevant to the reported issue. Other files like django/db/utils.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py also contain relevant code related to database routing and migration execution, which may interact with the MigrationRecorder and could be potential areas for further investigation or modification to resolve the issue.",

The `ensure_schema` method checks if the Migration model table exists in the database and creates it if it does not. This behavior can potentially create tables in databases where they should not be, violating the `allow_migrate` rules set by the custom router. Additionally, the `record_applied` method directly invokes `ensure_schema`, suggesting that any call to record a migration could inadvertently lead to schema creation. Furthermore, the MigrationExecutor's `apply_migration` and `record_migration` methods interact closely with the MigrationRecorder, indicating a critical path where the router's rules must be respected. It is crucial to verify how these methods adhere to or bypass the router's `allow_migrate` directives, particularly in a multi-db setup.

The primary focus is on the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder, which currently creates the django_migrations table without checking the router's allow_migrate method. We should modify ensure_schema to check if the current database is allowed to apply migrations before proceeding with the table creation. The relevant code sections include the ensure_schema, apply_migration, and record_migration methods in MigrationExecutor and MigrationRecorder. The ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method should also be consulted to ensure proper behavior. By analyzing the code spans provided, it's clear that the MigrationRecorder does not currently check the database router before creating tables or recording migrations, which is the root cause of the issue. By implementing these checks and consulting the router, we can ensure that migrations are only applied to the appropriate databases as specified by the allow_migrate rules.",

Also, the MigrationExecutor class uses MigrationRecorder, further tying the issue to the interaction between these classes. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method are mentioned in the issue, making them a key part of the context needed to fully understand and address the issue.

The `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema` method is responsible for checking if the django_migrations table exists and creating it if it doesn't. This method is called within `record_applied`, which means that whenever a migration is recorded as applied, the schema is ensured. This behavior can lead to the creation of tables in databases where they shouldn't be, as it doesn't seem to consult or respect the `allow_migrate` rule from the `ConnectionRouter`. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor.apply_migration` method uses the `MigrationRecorder` to record the migration, making it another critical point where the router's rules should be enforced. To address this, we need to understand how and where the `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate` method is invoked during the migration process to ensure that the recording and schema creation respect the multi-db setup rules.",

Specifically, the Router class's allow_migrate method should dictate whether migrations can be applied to non-default databases. The key components to be examined are:\n1. The MigrationRecorder's methods such as ensure_schema, which checks if the Migration model table exists and creates it if it doesn't, without respecting the allow_migrate rule.\n2. The MigrationExecutor's methods like apply_migration and record_migration, which invoke MigrationRecorder to record migrations.\n3. The ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method, which determines if a migration is allowed based on the provided router.\nIn light of these findings, it's evident that the MigrationRecorder's current implementation does not factor in the database router's decisions, leading to unintended table creations in non-default databases. Correcting this would involve modifying the MigrationRecorder to first consult the database router before executing operations.",

The `MigrationRecorder` class contains methods such as `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied`, which directly affect the recording and schema management of migrations. These methods, especially `record_applied`, make calls to `self.ensure_schema` without consulting the `allow_migrate` rule from the `ConnectionRouter`, thus potentially leading to the creation of tables in databases where they should not be. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class uses these methods in its `apply_migration` and `unapply_migration` processes, further reinforcing the need for the `allow_migrate` rule to be honored. The `ConnectionRouter`, though present, is not utilized in the schema checks within the `MigrationRecorder`, leading to the described behavior.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
