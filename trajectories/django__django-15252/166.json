Also, check the record_applied method to see how migrations are recorded. django/db/migrations/executor.py - particularly the apply_migration and record_migration methods, as they call the MigrationRecorder methods.

However, after reviewing the related method record_applied, I noticed that it calls ensure_schema every time a migration is recorded. This could potentially lead to multiple redundant checks depending on the number of migrations. While this is not incorrect, it might be more efficient to handle schema creation once at the start, considering that the schema is usually created or verified before any migration is applied. This can be done in the MigrationExecutor class, potentially in the _create_project_state method or in a dedicated method for initialization. This approach ensures we check the schema creation condition once rather than for each migration.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
