The expected behavior is that migrations should only be applied to the 'default' database as per the router's rules. However, the MigrationRecorder is trying to create tables in non-'default' databases, which violates the rules. The relevant files to investigate are those related to migration execution, recorder, and database creation, as these are where the migration application and recording take place. Additionally, we need to examine the router's logic and how it interacts with these processes.",

The issue specifically points out that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's allow_migrate rules, leading to the creation of the django_migrations table on databases where it should not be created.\n\nAfter analyzing the code spans in the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are primarily located in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, which contains the MigrationRecorder class and its methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied. These methods are central to the migration recording process and are directly implicated in the reported issue. The ensure_schema method, in particular, checks if the Migration model is in the tables of the connection and attempts to create the table if it does not exist, which is the core of the issue since this action disregards the db_router rules.\n\nAdditionally, the code spans in django/db/migrations/executor.py are relevant as they show how the MigrationExecutor interacts with the MigrationRecorder and how migrations are applied. Methods like apply_migration and record_migration are of interest here as they involve recording the application of migrations, which ties back to the MigrationRecorder's behavior.\n\nLastly, django/db/backends/base/creation.py is somewhat relevant due to its involvement in the creation of test databases and the execution of migrations during testing, which is a scenario mentioned in the reported issue. However, the focus should remain on the recorder.py and executor.py files as they directly deal with the recording and application of migrations, which are central to the issue at hand.\n\nIn summary, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the recording of migrations and the ensuring of schema in the MigrationRecorder class, as well as the methods in MigrationExecutor that interact with MigrationRecorder.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
