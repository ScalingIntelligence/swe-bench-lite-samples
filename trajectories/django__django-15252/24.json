Specifically, the MigrationRecorder should obey the db_router's allow_migrate rules and not create tables in databases other than the 'default' one. The focus should be on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, especially ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter and its allow_migrate method should be reviewed to ensure proper routing behavior.",

The focus is on ensuring that tables are not created on non-'default' connections when a router is in place. The analysis conducted on the search results led to the identification of key sections of code that are crucial to the functionality described in the issue. These sections include the `MigrationRecorder` class with its methods `__init__`, `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied`, which are responsible for ensuring the schema, recording applied migrations, and recording unapplied migrations, respectively. The code spans from `django/db/utils.py` pertaining to the `ConnectionRouter` and its methods `allow_migrate`, `allow_migrate_model`, and `get_migratable_models` were also significant as they interact with the database routing and migration permissions. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` with methods handling migration plans and applying migrations (`migration_plan`, `apply_migration`, `record_migration`) further solidified the relevance of these code segments to the issue at hand. Each identified code span is directly related to the core functionalities described in the reported issue, ensuring that tables are not created on non-'default' connections, and migration operations respect the database routing rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
