            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the fact that the MigrationRecorder in Django does not respect the allow_migrate rules defined in a custom database router, leading to undesired table creations in non-'default' databases. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals that the MigrationRecorder class indeed has methods that interact with the database schema, such as ensure_schema and record_applied, which do not appear to consult the database router's allow_migrate method before proceeding. This misalignment is critical, as the router's logic dictates that tables should only be created in the 'default' database, but the MigrationRecorder's methods may create tables in other databases as well. The relevant code spans are those within the MigrationRecorder class, particularly the ensure_schema and record_applied methods, and potentially anywhere else within this class where database interactions occur without consulting the router.\n\nThe code in django/db/migrations/executor.py also interacts with MigrationRecorder, suggesting that this part of the codebase might have influence over the behavior described in the issue. Specifically, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration method uses the MigrationRecorder, indicating that when migrations are applied, the problematic behavior could occur. This makes the spans within the MigrationExecutor class relevant, particularly the _create_project_state and apply_migration methods.\n\nFinally, the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py implements the allow_migrate method. While this class itself does not appear to directly interact with the MigrationRecorder, it defines the logic that should be consulted before any database schema changes. Understanding this logic is crucial to implement a solution that respects the database router's rules. Thus, the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter class is relevant for understanding the expected behavior in relation to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
