The issue specifically points to the method ensure_schema in the MigrationRecorder class, which does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules and creates tables in databases other than 'default'. This is evident in the ensure_schema method where it directly attempts to create the migration table if it does not exist without consulting the db_router. Additionally, the record_applied method, which calls ensure_schema, suggests potential issues with recording applied migrations in databases other than 'default'. The MigrationExecutor class interacts with MigrationRecorder and could also be involved in this issue, particularly in the apply_migration method which records migrations. To address this, it would be necessary to modify the ensure_schema method and possibly other methods like record_applied to respect the db_router settings when determining whether to create or access the migration table in non-'default' databases. The current search results provide the relevant code spans that need to be modified.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
