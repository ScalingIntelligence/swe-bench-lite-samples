The problem stems from the MigrationRecorder's behavior of creating tables in databases other than the default one, which contradicts the router's rules. To address this, we need to locate the specific methods and classes in Django's codebase that are responsible for schema checking, table creation, and migration recording, focusing on the MigrationRecorder and related executor methods. Additionally, inspect the DB router logic to ensure it correctly directs these operations to the appropriate database. We should also look at how test database setup invokes these methods to replicate the observed behavior.",

            "scratch_pad": "The provided file context includes relevant sections of Django's codebase that are crucial for understanding and addressing the reported issue. Specifically, the MigrationRecorder class in django/db/migrations/recorder.py contains methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied that are directly implicated in the schema creation and migration recording processes. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py shows how migrations are applied and recorded, indicating it interacts with the MigrationRecorder. Finally, the ConnectionRouter in django/db/utils.py handles DB routing, which is central to the issue of ensuring migrations only occur on the 'default' database as per the custom router's rules. Given the outlined context, I believe all relevant areas for fixing the issue are covered.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
