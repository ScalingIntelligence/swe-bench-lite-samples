The primary concern is that the MigrationRecorder attempts to create tables in databases other than 'default', even when the router explicitly disallows it. The focus should be on the methods of the MigrationRecorder class, especially those involving schema checking and migration recording, as well as the interaction with the ConnectionRouter and MigrationExecutor classes. The search should extend to the relevant methods in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/migrations/executor.py, and django/db/utils.py.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue points to an incorrect behavior in Django's MigrationRecorder where it does not take into account the rules set by the db_router for the 'allow_migrate' method. The db_router should determine whether migrations are allowed on a specific database connection, but it appears that the MigrationRecorder does not respect these rules and creates tables on all connections regardless of the router's setting. The relevant code spans from the search results are primarily in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, specifically, all methods of the MigrationRecorder class are relevant as they are involved in handling migrations and their recording in the database. The methods ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied seem particularly relevant, as they deal directly with ensuring the migration table schema, checking for applied migrations, and recording when migrations are applied or unapplied. These methods should ideally check with the db_router before executing any action on the database. Additionally, django/db/migrations/executor.py contains relevant code where the MigrationExecutor interacts with the MigrationRecorder to apply and unapply migrations. It is important to ensure that the migration actions taken by the MigrationExecutor respect the db routing rules as well. The ConnectionRouter in django/db/utils.py encapsulates the logic for routing database operations based on the rules set by the db_router. While not directly altering behavior of the MigrationRecorder or the MigrationExecutor, understanding the ConnectionRouter's operation is crucial for this task as it pertains to what 'allow_migrate' rules should be applied under which circumstances. The piece of the search results that discusses the 'prepare_test_settings' method of the ConnectionHandler is somewhat related in context to database operations during testing but does not contain direct changes that fix the reported issue.",

Specifically, the ensure_schema method in the MigrationRecorder class is responsible for checking and creating the schema if it does not exist, which is the behavior that does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules. This behavior is consistent with the issue described, as the MigrationRecorder attempts to create tables in databases other than 'default', even when the router explicitly disallows it. Additionally, the record_applied and record_unapplied methods also invoke ensure_schema, suggesting that they could also be affected by the same issue.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
