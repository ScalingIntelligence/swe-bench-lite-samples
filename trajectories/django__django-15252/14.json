This is crucial for multi-db setups where some connections should not have Django's migration tables created. To address this, the search results primarily focused on three files: 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', 'django/db/utils.py', and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. The MigrationRecorder class in 'recorder.py' contains methods that are critical to the process, such as 'ensure_schema', which checks for the existence of the migration table and creates it if not found. This behavior needs to be guarded by the allow_migrate rule from the router. In 'utils.py', the ConnectionRouter class handles the allow_migrate logic, which should be consulted before any database schema changes. Additionally, 'executor.py' contains the MigrationExecutor class, which manages the application of migrations and interacts closely with the MigrationRecorder. By examining these classes and methods, it is evident that the allow_migrate check should be integrated at the points where the MigrationRecorder accesses or alters the database schema to ensure compliance with the router's rules. This includes the 'ensure_schema' method in MigrationRecorder and the application logic in MigrationExecutor.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
