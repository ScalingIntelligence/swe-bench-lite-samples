Specifically, the MigrationRecorder should respect the db router's 'allow_migrate' rules and not create tables in non-'default' databases. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'applied_migrations'. Additionally, we should inspect the ConnectionRouter's 'allow_migrate' method and the MigrationExecutor's 'apply_migration' method to ensure they correctly interact with the router and recorder. Initial searches will be targeted at identifying implementations and interactions of these specific methods and classes.",

The relevant code spans identified are primarily from three files: django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/utils.py, and django/db/migrations/executor.py. In django/db/migrations/recorder.py, the methods ensure_schema, record_applied, record_unapplied, and applied_migrations are relevant as they handle the recording of migrations and schema management. The ensure_schema method directly addresses the concern by attempting to create the migration table if it does not exist, which is the root issue identified. In django/db/utils.py, the ConnectionRouter class and its methods such as allow_migrate and allow_migrate_model are relevant for understanding how the router decides which databases can have migrations applied to them. Lastly, in django/db/migrations/executor.py, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods migrate and apply_migration are crucial as they orchestrate the application of migrations, including recording them through the MigrationRecorder. These methods directly involve the process of applying migrations, which is central to the issue. Together, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of how migrations are recorded and managed, and how the database router influences this process.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
