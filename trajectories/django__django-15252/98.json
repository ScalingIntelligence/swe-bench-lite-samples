The main focus should be on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, especially ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations, as they are directly involved in recording and ensuring the migration schema. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods, particularly apply_migration and record_migration, should be examined as they interact with the MigrationRecorder. ConnectionRouter and its allow_migrate method are also crucial as they dictate which databases migrations are allowed on. Lastly, the BaseDatabaseCreation class and its _create_test_db method are relevant as they handle the creation of test databases, which is where the issue manifests during functional tests.",

The primary concern is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules, leading to the creation of migration tables in databases other than the 'default' one, which violates the intended behavior of the router. This is demonstrated in the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder, as it attempts to create the migration table if it does not already exist without consulting the database router. Furthermore, the methods applied_migrations and record_applied are also implicated, as they interact with the migration tables without considering the router's rules. The ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method, while related, does not directly address the issue of disregarding the router during migrations. The MigrationExecutor's methods, especially apply_migration and record_migration, also call the MigrationRecorder without ensuring that the router policies are followed. Lastly, the BaseDatabaseCreation class is involved in creating test databases, which triggers the migratory process, but it is not the core issue; the central issue remains within MigrationRecorder.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
