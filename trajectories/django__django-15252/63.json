This behavior is expected to prevent tables from being created in databases other than 'default'. The problem seems to be related to the ensure_schema() method in MigrationRecorder, which attempts to create the Migration model table if it doesn't exist. The analysis suggests that this method fails to consult the db_router's allow_migrate rules, leading to tables being incorrectly created in non-'default' databases. To resolve this, we need to search for the methods and classes involved in recording and applying migrations, as well as the db router's allow_migrate logic.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the incorrect behavior of the MigrationRecorder when dealing with a multi-db setup and a custom database router. The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the 'allow_migrate' rules of the router, leading to tables being created in non-'default' databases. The key areas of interest are the methods 'ensure_schema' and 'record_applied' in the MigrationRecorder class and the 'apply_migration' method in the MigrationExecutor class. Both methods call 'ensure_schema' and 'record_applied', respectively, which currently do not check the 'allow_migrate' rules before proceeding with schema creation and recording of applied migrations. The issue also highlights the importance of reviewing other methods like 'record_unapplied' for similar issues.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are primarily in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. The `ensure_schema` method in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` is directly responsible for ensuring the schema for the migration recorder, which currently lacks any checks against the database router's 'allow_migrate' rules. Similarly, the `apply_migration` method in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` calls `self.record_migration`, which involves recording applied migrations without considering the 'allow_migrate' rules. These code spans need to be adjusted to integrate checks against the 'allow_migrate' rules before proceeding with schema creation and recording.\n\nAdditionally, `django/db/utils.py` contains the `ConnectionRouter` class with its `allow_migrate` method, which is the basis for the router rules that should be consulted before any migration-related actions.",

The file context provided includes sections of the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes that handle migration recording and application.

The key components to analyze are the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method and the allow_migrate method in the database router. From the provided context and search results, it's clear that the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method checks if the table exists and attempts to create it if it does not. However, it does not currently check the database router for allow_migrate rules before attempting to create the table. The ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method should be consulted to determine if the migration should be allowed on the specified database. Relevant code spans include the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema, has_table, record_applied, and record_unapplied methods, as well as the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate and allow_migrate_model methods. These spans are crucial for understanding how migrations are recorded and how database routing rules are implemented. The identified spans will help in modifying the ensure_schema method to first check the database router's allow_migrate rules before creating the table, thus addressing the reported issue.",

The next step should be to verify and potentially modify the `ensure_schema` method in `MigrationRecorder` and the `apply_migration` method in `MigrationExecutor` to ensure they consult the `allow_migrate` method from `ConnectionRouter` before making any changes.

The search results include key methods of the MigrationRecorder such as has_table, ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied, which are critical for understanding how migrations are recorded and tables are ensured.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
