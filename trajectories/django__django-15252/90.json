The router's 'allow_migrate' rule is not respected by the MigrationRecorder when determining whether to create tables in non-'default' databases during migrations. The focus should be on the MigrationRecorder class and related migration execution functions, as well as the parts of the codebase that interact with db routers. Specifically, the search should target the 'ensure_schema' method in MigrationRecorder, 'apply_migration' in MigrationExecutor, and methods in ConnectionRouter related to migration allowances and database settings.",

The provided code spans show implementations of these methods in the MigrationRecorder class. Additionally, examining the ConnectionRouter class is crucial, as it handles the routing decisions based on the db_router settings. The code spans from django/db/migrations/executor.py are particularly relevant as they show how migrations are applied and recorded, which directly impacts the issue. The MigrationExecutor class methods like apply_migration and record_migration are central to the migration process and should be inspected for adherence to routing rules. Another important aspect is the Operation class in django/db/migrations/operations/base.py, which includes allow_migrate_model method, reflecting on how migration operations are filtered based on the db_router's rules.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
