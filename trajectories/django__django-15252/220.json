The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's allow_migrate rules, specifically creating tables on non-default connections. This leads to unintended table creation on databases that should not be migrated. The relevant code spans to investigate this issue are primarily in the MigrationRecorder class, particularly the `ensure_schema` and `record_applied` methods, as well as in the MigrationExecutor class where migrations are applied and recorded. The ConnectionRouter class is also relevant to understand how the allow_migrate rules are supposed to be applied. Specifically, the `ensure_schema` method in MigrationRecorder checks if the migration table exists, and if not, attempts to create it, which could violate the database router's rules. The `record_applied` method also calls `ensure_schema` and records when a migration is applied, which could also be impacted by the router's rules. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor's `apply_migration` and `record_migration` methods are critical points where migrations are applied and recorded, directly interacting with the MigrationRecorder. These spans of code are the focus for addressing the reported issue.",

Additionally, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration method involves calling self.recorder.record_applied, which in turn calls ensure_schema.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
