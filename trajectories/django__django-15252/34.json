Specifically, the issue highlights that even with a router that should restrict table creation to the 'default' database, the MigrationRecorder attempts to create the table on other database connections. The relevant code spans are identified by tracing the path of how migrations are applied and recorded. The key methods involved are ensure_schema in MigrationRecorder, which checks for the existence of the Migration model table and attempts to create it if it does not exist, without considering the db_router's allow_migrate rules. Additionally, the record_applied and record_unapplied methods also call ensure_schema, indicating that they may exhibit the same behavior. The MigrationExecutor class, which orchestrates the migration process, also interacts with the MigrationRecorder in methods like apply_migration and migrate, further reinforcing the relevance of these code spans. Overall, these code spans are critical for understanding and potentially addressing the issue with the MigrationRecorder not obeying the db_router's allow_migrate rules.",

The MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method and the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration and migrate methods are especially relevant, as they are directly involved in the process of creating tables and applying migrations across different databases. While the current implementation does call ensure_schema before applying each migration, there doesn't appear to be explicit checks to ensure that the current database matches the 'default' one as specified in the router's allow_migrate method. This gap suggests that the reported issue might be valid, as there's no evidence of the code obeying the db_router rules at the point where schema creation occurs. Therefore, further investigation would be needed to determine if additional methods need to be updated to enforce the router's rules during schema operations.",

This confirms the reported issue's concern that the table creation does not respect the custom router's rules. To finalize the task, we need to ensure that all methods in MigrationRecorder that perform schema operations (like ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied) incorporate these rules.

Specifically, the `ensure_schema` method in MigrationRecorder creates the necessary schema for recording migrations if it doesn't already exist. Additionally, `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` methods first call `ensure_schema`. However, there doesn't seem to be an explicit check for the `allow_migrate` rules before schema operations, which could lead to violations of these rules in multi-db setups. We need to extend our search to ensure that all schema-related operations use the `allow_migrate` rules from custom database routers. Furthermore, reviewing the `MigrationExecutor` methods can offer more context on how these operations are orchestrated and possibly reveal other relevant interactions.",

The issue specifically mentions concerns with the ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied methods in the MigrationRecorder class. The provided search results include relevant sections of code in the 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' files, which are central to addressing the issue. The MigrationRecorder class methods ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied are identified as relevant, as well as the methods in the MigrationExecutor class that interact with MigrationRecorder. Additionally, the 'django/db/utils.py' file contains the ConnectionRouter class, which is crucial for understanding how database routing is handled and how migrations are allowed or disallowed based on the router settings. The analysis of these code sections reveals that the current implementation of ensure_schema does not consider the database router's allow_migrate rules before creating the django_migrations table, which is the core problem described in the issue. The identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of the codebase needed to address the reported issue.",

This behavior could lead to the creation of the migration table on non-'default' databases, violating the intended multi-db setup. More specifically, `ensure_schema` method in `MigrationRecorder` tries to create the migration table if it doesn't already exist, without a check for `allow_migrate`. Additionally, methods like `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` directly call `ensure_schema`, respectively, without consulting the router rules.",

Additionally, a review of the `django/test/runner.py` and `django/db/backends/creation.py` files might give more insight into how test databases are set up and if they appropriately respect the `allow_migrate` rules."

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
