The problem is highlighted when running functional tests, where the migrate command attempts to create tables in non-default databases. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its method ensure_schema, which checks for the presence of the Migration model's table and tries to create it if it's missing. We should also look at methods like record_applied and applied_migrations that might similarly bypass database routing rules. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods, such as apply_migration and record_migration, should be examined to ensure they respect the db_router rules.",

Specifically, the issue points out that the 'MigrationRecorder' does not check the 'allow_migrate' rules before attempting to create the 'django_migrations' table in the database. This leads to the table being created in databases that should not have it according to the routing rules.\n\nThe search results provided show relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. These files contain the 'MigrationRecorder' and 'MigrationExecutor' classes, respectively, which are central to the migration process. Key methods in these classes, such as 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema', 'MigrationRecorder.applied_migrations', and 'MigrationRecorder.record_applied', directly deal with ensuring the schema and recording migrations. Additionally, the 'MigrationExecutor.apply_migration' and 'MigrationExecutor.record_migration' methods in 'executor.py' are also crucial as they interact with the 'MigrationRecorder'.\n\nTo address the issue, it is essential to ensure that the 'MigrationRecorder' respects the 'allow_migrate' rules from the router before creating the 'django_migrations' table or recording migration applications. This involves modifying the 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and possibly other methods in the 'MigrationRecorder' class to check with the router whenever a database operation is about to be performed.\n\nThe 'django/db/utils.py' file is also relevant as it contains the 'ConnectionRouter' class, which includes the 'allow_migrate' method. This method is the one that the 'MigrationRecorder' class needs to consult to decide whether to proceed with database operations on a particular database.\n\nGiven the complexity and potential impact on other parts of the migration process, care should be taken to ensure that any modifications do not inadvertently disrupt other functionalities within Django's migration system.",

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
