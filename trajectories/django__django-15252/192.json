This suggests that the database migrations are trying to create tables on connections other than the 'default' connection, which is against the intended behavior. We need to investigate the MigrationRecorder class and the related methods like ensure_schema(), applied_migrations(), and record_applied() to see how they interact with the database router. Additionally, we should look into the MigrationExecutor class and its methods which interact with the MigrationRecorder, especially apply_migration() and record_migration(). Lastly, we need to check the creation of test databases in the test runner setup to understand how migrations are being applied during the tests.",

The key problem is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the 'allow_migrate' rules specified in the router, which results in the creation of the 'django_migrations' table in non-'default' databases. The relevant code spans identified are:\n\n1. **django/db/migrations/recorder.py**: This file contains the MigrationRecorder class with methods such as 'ensure_schema', 'applied_migrations', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied'. These methods are central to the issue as they handle the creation and management of the 'django_migrations' table.\n\n2. **django/db/migrations/executor.py**: This file contains the MigrationExecutor class with methods such as 'apply_migration' and 'record_migration'. These methods interact with the MigrationRecorder and are crucial in understanding how migrations are applied and recorded.\n\n3. **django/db/backends/base/creation.py**: This file contains the BaseDatabaseCreation class with the 'create_test_db' method. This method is relevant because it calls the 'migrate' command, which in turn uses the MigrationExecutor to apply migrations during the setup of test databases.\n\nThe identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the areas where the behavior regarding the 'allow_migrate' rules should be enforced or corrected. Further investigation and possible modifications would be required within these spans to ensure that the 'django_migrations' table is only created in the 'default' database as specified by the router.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
