The MigrationRecorder class should respect the router's decision to not create tables on non-'default' connections, but it appears to be trying to create a table on all connections. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class methods and ensure they correctly handle the allow_migrate rules. Additionally, we should investigate the apply_migration method in the MigrationExecutor class, as it interacts directly with the MigrationRecorder. Lastly, to fully capture the context, we should also look into the relevant methods in the ConnectionRouter class and the BaseDatabaseCreation class, which are critical for understanding how the db connections and test databases are managed.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the MigrationRecorder class in Django's migration system when dealing with a multi-db setup and custom database routers. Specifically, the issue outlines that the MigrationRecorder should respect the rules defined in the custom router and not create the 'django_migrations' table in databases other than the 'default' connection. After analyzing the provided search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are primarily found in the django/db/migrations/recorder.py file. This file contains the definition of the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, including 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied', all of which might potentially ignore the db_router rules and create the 'django_migrations' table in the wrong database. Additionally, the django/db/migrations/executor.py file contains the MigrationExecutor class, which interacts with the MigrationRecorder, and is also likely relevant to the issue. The django/db/utils.py file includes the ConnectionRouter class, which is responsible for routing operations based on the configured routers, and its 'allow_migrate' method might also be pertinent. Finally, the django/db/backends/base/creation.py file contains the BaseDatabaseCreation class which is responsible for creating test databases and running migrations during tests, making it relevant to the reported issue. Collectively, these code spans provide a comprehensive understanding of the areas that could be causing the described behavior and are crucial for addressing the issue.",

This method does not currently check the allow_migrate rule before creating the table, which is the core of the issue. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class is included, where the apply_migration method interacts with the MigrationRecorder. This provides context on how migrations are applied and how the recorder is used. The ConnectionRouter class is also included, which is essential for understanding how the database router and its allow_migrate method work. Lastly, the BaseDatabaseCreation class is provided, crucial for understanding how test databases are created and managed, which is relevant to the issue since test databases also invoke migration processes. Given this comprehensive context, all relevant code for addressing the issue has been identified.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
