The router is intended to prevent migrations from being applied to databases other than 'default'. However, the `MigrationRecorder` tries to ensure the schema in all databases, potentially creating the Migration table inappropriately. To resolve this, we need to locate the relevant code related to `MigrationRecorder`, `MigrationExecutor`, and the database router configuration to understand how the migration recording and schema checking are handled. We should also check how database routers are being respected during the test database setup.",

The user expects that the MigrationRecorder should respect the allow_migrate rules defined in the router and not create the Migration table in databases other than 'default'. The provided search results include relevant code spans from three files: django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/utils.py, and django/db/backends/base/creation.py. The `MigrationRecorder` class includes methods such as `ensure_schema`, `applied_migrations`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied`, which are central to the recording of migrations and schema management and could be directly impacted by the router's rules. The `ConnectionRouter` class in django/db/utils.py defines the `allow_migrate` method that should be respected to control database migrations. Additionally, the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class in django/db/backends/base/creation.py includes methods related to creating test databases and running migrations, which are directly related to the migration process described in the issue. By examining these code spans, I can identify segments that are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the issue of migration table creation across multiple databases.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
