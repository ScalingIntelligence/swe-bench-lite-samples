The expectation is that migrations should only be applied to the 'default' database and not to other databases. However, the MigrationRecorder is incorrectly creating tables in other databases, which violates the router's rules. To address this, it's necessary to focus on the MigrationRecorder and its related methods, as well as the database router's allow_migrate method. Additionally, the executor and backend creation logic should be examined to ensure they respect the router's decisions. Searching for the specific methods and classes involved in these processes will help pinpoint the exact code areas needing adjustments.",

The issue specifically points to the incorrect creation of the Migration table on non-'default' connections when a db_router is provided. The key pieces of code to look at are the methods related to migration recording and schema ensuring in the MigrationRecorder class, as well as the executor's apply_migration method which interacts with the MigrationRecorder. The search results provide relevant spans of code in the `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/migrations/executor.py` files, which are critical for understanding how migrations are recorded and applied in Django. Additionally, the `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` is also relevant as it deals with the routing of database operations based on the rules provided by the router, including the `allow_migrate` method. These code spans are relevant because they directly pertain to the functionality under discussion: the creation and recording of database migrations and how they interact with database routers to determine which databases to apply migrations to. The identified code spans will help in understanding the current behavior and potentially planning fixes to ensure the MigrationRecorder adheres to the db_router's rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
