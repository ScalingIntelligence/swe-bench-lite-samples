Additionally, we need to examine how the MigrationExecutor applies migrations and records them. Lastly, we should check how the test runner and database creation scripts handle migrations across multiple databases. A key class to investigate is `MigrationRecorder`, along with related functions and methods in `MigrationExecutor`, `ConnectionRouter`, and database creation scripts.",

The main focus is to align the behavior of the MigrationRecorder with the rules defined in the custom router. By examining the search results, it is clear that the critical sections of code are located in django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py. These files contain the primary logic for handling migrations and ensuring the schema is correctly set up. Specifically, the MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema method is responsible for creating the table if it does not exist, which needs to respect the db_router rules. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor.apply_migration method, which uses the MigrationRecorder, should also honor these rules to ensure migrations are applied correctly based on the routing configuration.",

The issue points out that the MigrationRecorder's 'ensure_schema' method is creating a migration table on all connections, not just the 'default' database, violating the expected behavior when a db_router is in place. From the provided search results, several relevant code spans have been identified, mainly in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. The identified spans include 'MigrationRecorder' class and its methods 'ensure_schema' and 'record_applied', which are central to the issue. Additionally, 'MigrationExecutor' class and its method 'apply_migration' are also crucial as they interact with 'MigrationRecorder'. Lastly, 'BaseDatabaseCreation' class in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' is relevant as it triggers the creation of test databases and migrations, which is a part of the reported issue.",

The `ensure_schema` method directly checks and creates the `django_migrations` table without considering the `allow_migrate` rules from the database router. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` is used to apply migrations and makes calls to `self.recorder.record_applied`, which in turn calls `ensure_schema`. This process does not appear to consult the `allow_migrate` rules set by the router. In the context of test database creation, the `create_test_db` method in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` calls the 'migrate' command, which further involves the `MigrationExecutor` to apply migrations.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
