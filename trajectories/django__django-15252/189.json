The router's allow_migrate method should determine whether migrations are allowed on a given database. However, MigrationRecorder seems to incorrectly create tables in non-'default' databases, which is not expected behavior. The relevant classes and methods to investigate are MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and the database router implementation in django/db/utils.py. The methods to focus on are MigrationRecorder's record_applied and ensure_schema, MigrationExecutor's apply_migration, and the router's allow_migrate method.",

In 'recorder.py', the code spans 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema', 'MigrationRecorder.applied_migrations', 'MigrationRecorder.record_applied', and 'MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied' are directly related to the behavior described in the issue.

In 'executor.py', the code spans 'MigrationExecutor.__init__', 'MigrationExecutor.migrate', 'MigrationExecutor.apply_migration', 'MigrationExecutor.record_migration', and 'MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration' provide a broader context of how migrations are executed and how the MigrationRecorder is utilized within this process. These spans give insight into the integration and interaction with the MigrationRecorder, helping to understand the scope of the issue.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
