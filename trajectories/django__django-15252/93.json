The MigrationRecorder creates tables on non-default databases, which goes against the router's rules. To address this, we need to locate the relevant parts of the Django codebase that handle the creation and recording of migrations, specifically focusing on the parts where the database router's allow_migrate rules are checked and adhered to. We should look for the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, as well as the MigrationExecutor class and its methods for applying migrations. Additionally, we should examine the database connection handling and the test database setup to understand how migrations are being applied during tests.",

The main problem is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's allow_migrate rules, leading to tables being created in databases where they shouldn't. The issue mentions several specific points in the code where this problem manifests: 1) The MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema method checks for the existence of the Migration model table and creates it if it doesn't exist, without considering the router's rules. 2) The apply_migration method in MigrationExecutor uses the MigrationRecorder to record applied migrations, which could also bypass the router's rules. From the search results, the identified code spans cover these critical areas:\n\n- MigrationRecorder methods: ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, which are directly related to the schema and migration recording logic.\n- MigrationExecutor methods: apply_migration, which interacts with the MigrationRecorder and could potentially bypass the router rules.\n- ConnectionRouter methods: allow_migrate, which defines the router's rules for migration, suggesting that this logic should influence the MigrationRecorder's behavior.\n\nThese spans are directly relevant to the reported issue as they involve the core logic of how migrations are recorded and applied across multiple databases. The analysis of these spans indicates that they are critical to address the issue of respecting db_router's allow_migrate rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
