The main concerns are around the creation of tables in databases other than the 'default' one, which should be prevented by the router. To address this, we should focus our search on the relevant parts of the Django codebase that handle migrations and database operations, specifically looking into the MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and ConnectionRouter classes. We need to verify if the logic in these classes respects the allow_migrate rule provided by a custom router.",

The key components to look for in the code are the methods where the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database, especially those that involve creating or checking for the presence of the 'django_migrations' table. From the search results, several key methods are found in the 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' file within the MigrationRecorder class: 'ensure_schema', 'applied_migrations', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied'. These methods are critical as they directly deal with ensuring the schema, recording applied migrations, and unapplied migrations. Additionally, the 'django/db/utils.py' file contains the ConnectionRouter class which is responsible for routing database operations based on the rules defined in the db_router. Specifically, the 'allow_migrate' method in the ConnectionRouter class is of interest as this is where the decision is made whether to allow migration on a particular database. The 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' file contains the MigrationExecutor class which uses the MigrationRecorder to apply and unapply migrations. The 'apply_migration' and 'unapply_migration' methods in this class are relevant as they call methods on the MigrationRecorder to record migration operations. These components collectively provide a comprehensive view of the migration process and how the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database and the db_router to manage migrations. The identified code spans are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue where the MigrationRecorder does not obey the db_router's allow_migrate rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
