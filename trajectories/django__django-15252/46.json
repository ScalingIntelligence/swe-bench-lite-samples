The search should focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly record_applied and ensure_schema. Additionally, the executor's apply_migration method, which interacts with the MigrationRecorder, needs inspection. Looking at the router's allow_migrate method might also be insightful for understanding the expected behavior.",

In `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods `ensure_schema` and `record_applied` are central to the issue. The `ensure_schema` method checks if the Migration model table exists and creates it if it does not, which should be subjected to the router's decision.\n2. In `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class and its method `apply_migration` are crucial as they involve migration application and interaction with the `MigrationRecorder`.\n3. In `django/db/utils.py`, the `ConnectionRouter` class and its method `allow_migrate` are found, which directly controls whether a migration is allowed for a specific database based on the router's rules.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue with the MigrationRecorder not respecting the db_router allow_migrate rules.",

The key part of the issue is that the 'MigrationRecorder' should respect the 'allow_migrate' rules defined in the custom router. Upon analysis, the relevant code spans identified are primarily in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' contains the 'MigrationRecorder' class with methods like 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied'. These methods directly involve schema checks and additions to the 'django_migrations' table, which align with the issue's focus on migration table creation and updates. 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' contains the 'MigrationExecutor' class, which integrates with 'MigrationRecorder' and is crucial for the execution of migration plans. The methods 'apply_migration', 'record_migration', and '_create_project_state' in 'MigrationExecutor' are particularly relevant as they orchestrate and record the migration process, closely tied to the behavior described in the issue. Additionally, the 'ConnectionRouter' in 'django/db/utils.py' plays a role in routing database operations according to the defined rules, including the 'allow_migrate' method. Considering all these pieces, the existing code spans in the file context and the new search results align well with the reported issue, providing a detailed context to understand and potentially address the problem.",

This directly addresses the concern about schema creation not respecting the `allow_migrate` rules. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` shows the context in which `MigrationRecorder` is used, notably in the `apply_migration` method. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` handles the routing logic, linking back to the customization mentioned in the issue. Given these parts, it seems sufficient to understand the current state of how the router and recorder interact regarding schema management. However, it does not directly show the integration or checks where the router's rules could potentially be ignored during schema creation or migration recording. This suggests a need to find more precise connections where the router's rules should influence but might not be correctly applied.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
