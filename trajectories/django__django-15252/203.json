            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around ensuring that the MigrationRecorder class in Django's migration system adheres to the database routing rules specified by the user, particularly the allow_migrate method. The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder tries to create the 'django_migrations' table on all connections, not just the 'default' connection, which contradicts the allow_migrate rules. This can be seen in the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder class, where it creates the table if it doesn't exist without checking the database routing rules. This behavior is problematic when using a custom router that restricts migrations to specific databases. The aim is to ensure that database operations respect the routing rules defined by the user.\n\nThe search results provide critical insights into the relevant parts of the Django codebase involved in this issue. The MigrationRecorder class and its methods (ensure_schema, record_applied) directly interact with the database schema and migrations, making these parts crucial for addressing the issue. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods (apply_migration, record_migration) also play a significant role as they orchestrate the application of migrations and record their status. The ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method are central to enforcing database routing rules. Identifying these sections of code is essential to understand the current behavior and to modify the system to respect the routing rules correctly.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the MigrationRecorder in a multi-db setup where a custom router is used to control which databases migrations are allowed on. The key point is that migrations should not create tables on databases other than the 'default' one, as specified by the router. Currently, the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method checks if the Migration table exists and, if not, attempts to create it, which bypasses the router's allow_migrate rules. This is the behavior that needs to be corrected.\n\nReviewing the provided context and search results, the relevant parts of the codebase involve the MigrationRecorder class in django/db/migrations/recorder.py and the MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py. The MigrationRecorder's methods ensure_schema, record_applied, record_unapplied, and flush are particularly relevant, as they interact with the database schema and record migration states. The MigrationExecutor's apply_migration and record_migration methods also play a role, as they use the MigrationRecorder to update the state of applied migrations.\n\nThe ConnectionRouter in django/db/utils.py is also relevant, as it is responsible for routing database operations according to the provided router configurations. The allow_migrate method in particular needs to be respected by the MigrationRecorder.\n\nIn summary, the relevant code spans include the methods in MigrationRecorder related to schema and migration state recording, the methods in MigrationExecutor that interact with the MigrationRecorder, and the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter.",

The issue revolves around the MigrationRecorder not considering the allow_migrate rules from the db_router before attempting to ensure the schema or record migrations. The current implementation of the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder directly attempts to create a schema without checking the router's allow_migrate rules. This behavior is evident in the record_applied and record_unapplied methods, which both call ensure_schema at the beginning. The MigrationExecutor class also initializes the MigrationRecorder without considering the router's rules during these operations. These pieces of evidence strongly suggest that the reported issue is accurately represented in the provided file context, reflecting an oversight in checking the database router's allow_migrate directive before performing critical actions related to schema creation and migration record management.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
