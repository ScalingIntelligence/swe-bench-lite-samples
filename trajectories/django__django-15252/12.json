The expected behavior is that the `MigrationRecorder` should respect the `allow_migrate` rules defined in the router, specifically not creating tables in databases other than the 'default' one. The analysis of the provided search results shows that the `MigrationRecorder` class has methods like `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` that directly interact with the database schema and record migration states. These methods do not currently check the `allow_migrate` rules before performing actions on the database, which seems to be the root cause of the issue. On the other hand, the `ConnectionRouter` class does have an `allow_migrate` method that evaluates the rules but is not integrated into the `MigrationRecorder`'s logic. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those in the `MigrationRecorder` class, particularly the methods `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied`.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
