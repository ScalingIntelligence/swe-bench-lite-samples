Specifically, it appears that the MigrationRecorder attempts to create tables in databases other than the 'default' one, even when the router dictates otherwise. To address this, we need to identify and review the relevant methods and code sections within the MigrationRecorder class, focusing on methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations to ensure they adhere to the db_router's instructions. Additionally, we should look at the MigrationExecutor class and its methods, particularly those involved in applying and recording migrations, to understand if and how they interact with the router logic.",

These code spans include the methods such as ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied in the MigrationRecorder class, which directly deal with recording applied and unapplied migrations, and ensuring the schema for the migration table. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class's methods such as apply_migration and unapply_migration are crucial as they manage the application and reversal of migrations using the MigrationRecorder. These methods should be reviewed to ensure they correctly adhere to the allow_migrate rules specified by a router.

Specifically, the MigrationRecorder class contains the methods ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied, which are directly implicated in the creation and recording of migration status in the database. The MigrationExecutor class also includes methods such as apply_migration and unapply_migration, which interact with the MigrationRecorder to apply or reverse migrations. The code provided seems sufficient to identify the areas where the db_router's allow_migrate rules might not be respected, as indicated in the issue. The examination of these methods suggests that the Router's allow_migrate rules could be enforced at the point of schema creation or migration record application to ensure that tables are only created in the 'default' database as per the router's instructions. No additional code sections were noted that could contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of the issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
