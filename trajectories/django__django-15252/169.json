            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the behavior of the MigrationRecorder in Django's migration system when dealing with a multi-db setup and a custom db_router. The expectation is that the Migration table should only be created in the 'default' database, but it seems to be created in other databases as well, which goes against the rules set by the custom router. To address this, I need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly the ensure_schema method, which is responsible for creating the Migration table if it doesn't exist. Additionally, I should check the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter class to ensure it correctly respects the custom router's rules. I will also need to look at the MigrationExecutor class where the migration is applied and recorded, and the BaseDatabaseCreation class where test databases are created.",

The issue is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's allow_migrate rules and creates the django_migrations table in all connections, not just the 'default' one. This behavior is observed in methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, applied_migrations, and record_unapplied of the MigrationRecorder class. The relevance of the provided code spans is evaluated based on their alignment with the reported issue. The identified code spans from django/db/migrations/recorder.py include the ensure_schema method, the record_applied method, the applied_migrations method, and the has_table method, which directly relate to the creation and verification of the django_migrations table. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class's allow_migrate method in django/db/utils.py is also considered relevant as it is responsible for determining whether a migration is allowed on a particular database, which should be consulted before any attempt to create or modify the django_migrations table. The MigrationExecutor class's apply_migration method and related methods in django/db/migrations/executor.py are also relevant as they interact with the MigrationRecorder and could play a part in the observed behavior. The BaseDatabaseCreation class's _create_test_db method in django/db/backends/base/creation.py is less directly related to the core issue but is still considered as it pertains to database creation and might reference or influence the behavior of the MigrationRecorder during test executions.",

Additionally, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration method records migrations without ensuring that the current database should be allowed to migrate by the router. To address these issues, I need to focus on how the MigrationRecorder interacts with the router rules, and how these rules are checked and applied during the migration process.

The router in question is designed to prevent migrations from being applied to databases other than the 'default' one. The main points of interest are the methods within the MigrationRecorder class that handle schema checking and recording of applied and unapplied migrations.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' files. These files contain the definitions of the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes, respectively. The key methods to focus on are those that interact with or could potentially be affected by the custom router's migration rules, such as 'ensure_schema', 'applied_migrations', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied' in the MigrationRecorder class, as well as 'apply_migration' and 'unapply_migration' in the MigrationExecutor class. These methods are directly involved in managing the migration state and applying or reverting migrations, which are central to the issue at hand.\n\nAdditionally, analyzing the 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' file is relevant as it deals with the creation and setup of test databases, which might also invoke migration processes and potentially have the same issue concerning the placement of the 'django_migrations' table. Understanding how these components interact and ensuring they respect the custom router's rules is crucial for resolving the reported issue.",

From the provided file context, the `MigrationRecorder` class has methods that need to be checked for compliance with the `allow_migrate` rules. Specifically, the `ensure_schema` method directly attempts to create the `django_migrations` table without checking if the current database should have migrations applied based on the router rules. We should introduce a check that enforces the `allow_migrate` rules before performing actions like creating the migrations table or recording applied migrations. In addition, the `apply_migration` method within the `MigrationExecutor` class also directly records migrations without a compliance check. This process should be adjusted to first check the router's rules before proceeding with migration recording.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
