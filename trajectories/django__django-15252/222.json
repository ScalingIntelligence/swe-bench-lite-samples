Specifically, the Migration model's table should not be created on any connection other than the 'default' connection when a router is in place. The problem seems to be in the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder, which attempts to create the Migration table if it's not found, regardless of the router's rules. Relevant files to investigate include django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/utils.py, and possibly other files in the django/db/migrations/ directory.",

Specifically, the user expects that the Migration model table should not be created on any connection other than the 'default' connection when a db_router is provided. The search results provided include the relevant code spans in the MigrationRecorder class, which handles the recording of applied and unapplied migrations, and ensures the schema for the Migration model. Notably, the ensure_schema method checks if the Migration model table exists in the current connection and attempts to create it if it does not exist, which is a primary concern as it does not consider the db_router's allow_migrate rules. Additionally, the applied_migrations and record_unapplied methods also call ensure_schema, indicating that similar issues may exist with these methods as well. The ConnectionRouter class is also relevant as it contains the logic for the allow_migrate method that should influence where the Migration model table is created. Given this context, the relevant code spans identified include those from the MigrationRecorder class that deal with schema checks and table creation, as well as those from the ConnectionRouter class that deal with migration permissions.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
