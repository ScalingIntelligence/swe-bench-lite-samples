The expectation is that tables should only be created in the 'default' connection and not in other connections. However, the MigrationRecorder is trying to create the Migration table in all connections, which contradicts the allow_migrate rules defined in the router. The relevant files and methods to investigate are MigrationRecorder in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, ConnectionRouter in django/db/utils.py, and MigrationExecutor in django/db/migrations/executor.py. Additionally, methods related to creating test databases in django/db/backends/base/creation.py should also be checked.",

The user has a simple router with allow_migrate that should only allow migrations on the 'default' database. The issue arises when the test databases are created and the migrate command is run against each connection. MigrationRecorder tries to apply migrations, potentially creating tables outside the 'default' database, which violates the router's rules. I then reviewed the provided search results, especially focusing on the files `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, `django/db/utils.py`, and `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. The relevant code spans include the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods `record_applied` and `ensure_schema` in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, which are central to the issue as they handle the recording of applied migrations and ensuring the schema for migrations. Additionally, I identified the `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` and its method `allow_migrate` as it directly implements the logic for routing migration permissions. Lastly, in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class and its method `apply_migration are relevant as they orchestrate the application of migrations.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
