            "scratch_pad": "The issue is related to the MigrationRecorder not respecting the db_router's allow_migrate rules in a multi-db setup. The primary focus should be on ensuring that the Migration model's table is not created on connections other than the 'default' connection. This involves investigating the MigrationRecorder class and its methods like ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_unapplied in the django/db/migrations/recorder.py file. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method in django/db/utils.py should be reviewed to ensure it correctly routes migrations. The MigrationExecutor's apply_migration method in django/db/migrations/executor.py is also relevant, as it interacts with the MigrationRecorder. Finally, the BaseDatabaseCreation's _create_test_db method in django/db/backends/base/creation.py is crucial, as it handles the creation of test databases, which triggers migrations.",

The methods `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `applied_migrations` are particularly relevant as they interact with the database schema.\n\n2. `django/db/utils.py` - This file contains the `ConnectionRouter` class which handles the routing of database operations based on the configured routers. The `allow_migrate` method is relevant here as it determines whether a migration should be applied to a particular database.\n\n3. `django/db/migrations/executor.py` - This file contains the `MigrationExecutor` class which is responsible for executing migrations. The `apply_migration` and `migrate` methods are relevant as they call methods on `MigrationRecorder` and interact with the database.\n\n4. `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` - This file contains the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class which handles the creation of test databases. Although less directly related to the core issue, it is still relevant as it involves the creation and management of databases.\n\nBy analyzing these methods and classes, we can identify the relevant code spans that need to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that the db_router's `allow_migrate` rules are obeyed.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
