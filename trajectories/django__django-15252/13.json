The MigrationRecorder is trying to create tables in non-default databases despite the router's rules. This suggests that the MigrationRecorder may not be correctly considering the router's allow_migrate rule. To address this, we need to examine the MigrationRecorder's methods and how they interact with the database router. Additionally, we should check the MigrationExecutor to see if it correctly respects the router's decisions.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the behavior of the MigrationRecorder class in Django's migrations module, specifically how it handles the creation of the 'django_migrations' table across different database connections when a custom database router is in place. The issue mentions that despite having a router that should restrict table creation to the 'default' database, the table is being created on all connections, which is not the expected behavior.\n\nFrom the search results, I analyzed the code in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. These files contain the critical classes 'MigrationRecorder' and 'MigrationExecutor', which are directly involved in managing migration records and applying migrations across databases. The methods 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied' in the 'MigrationRecorder' class are of particular interest as they handle schema checks and migration record updates.\n\nAdditionally, the 'MigrationExecutor' class is responsible for executing migrations and relies on the 'MigrationRecorder' for recording migration statuses. The 'migrate' method in 'MigrationExecutor' calls 'ensure_schema' on the recorder, indicating the connection point where the router should potentially influence the behavior but currently does not.\n\nGiven the focus of the issue, the 'MigrationRecorder' class and its methods dealing with schema management and recording applied and unapplied migrations are directly relevant. However, the provided code does not show immediate integration with the database router to handle these operations selectively based on the router's rules. Therefore, the relevant code spans are identified to understand the current behavior better, setting the stage for future modifications to integrate with the database router.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
