The provided search results include three files that are potentially relevant: django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/utils.py, and django/db/migrations/executor.py. The issue specifically mentions the ensure_schema method in the MigrationRecorder class, which is responsible for creating the django_migrations table if it does not exist. The issue suggests that this table should not be created on non-'default' databases when a db_router is in use. The ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py is responsible for routing database operations based on the rules defined in the router, including the allow_migrate method. The MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py interacts with the MigrationRecorder to apply migrations, including the ensure_schema method. The relevant code spans include the initialization of the MigrationRecorder, the ensure_schema method, the applied_migrations and record_applied methods (since they also call ensure_schema), and the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter. These spans are critical for understanding and addressing the issue of the MigrationRecorder not adhering to the db_router rules.",

This is in line with the issue reported. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor and its interactions with the MigrationRecorder support the workflow where the issue could manifest. The ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method is also provided, showing how the router should theoretically filter database operations.

Specifically, it is expected that tables should not be created in databases other than the 'default' when a router is in place. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that the MigrationRecorder class has methods that interact directly with the database to create the 'django_migrations' table and record migrations. The concern is that these methods do not check or apply the allow_migrate rules before attempting to create the table or record migration status. This behavior could lead to tables being created on databases where they should not, as per the specified router rules. The relevant code spans include: - MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema: This method attempts to create the 'django_migrations' table if it does not already exist. It does not consult the router to check if creating the table on the current connection is allowed. - MigrationRecorder.applied_migrations and MigrationRecorder.record_applied: These methods also interact with the database without checking the allow_migrate rule. This oversight could lead to incorrect recording of applied migrations. The ConnectionRouter class does have an allow_migrate method, which iterates over configured routers to check if a migration is allowed on a specific database. However, the MigrationRecorder class does not utilize this mechanism before executing database-modifying operations. The identified code spans indicate where this integration is needed to enforce the database router rules properly.",

The current implementation appears to create the django_migrations table on any database connection, regardless of the routing configuration. The key elements to consider are the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder, which checks for the existence of the table and creates it if it doesn't exist, and the allow_migrate method in ConnectionRouter, which determines whether a migration is allowed on a given database. The analysis of the code spans provided reveals that the ensure_schema method does not check the database routing rules before attempting to create the table, which is the core issue outlined in the reported problem. Additionally, the record_applied and record_unapplied methods also call ensure_schema, indicating that they could also exhibit the same issue. The relevant code spans to address this issue are identified in the MigrationRecorder and ConnectionRouter classes, specifically focusing on integrating a check for the allow_migrate rule before table creation or migration recording operations.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
