The focus should be on identifying where the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database and how it checks or creates tables. Specifically, the ensure_schema method in django/db/migrations/recorder.py seems critical as it directly involves checking and potentially creating the Migration table. Additionally, tracing the flow of the migrate command and understanding how the MigrationExecutor interacts with the recorder could provide deeper insights into the problem. Also, the Router class definition and how it is used within the ConnectionRouter should be reviewed. Given the complexity of the issue, multiple search requests targeting specific methods and patterns are necessary.",

            "scratch_pad": "1. The reported issue focuses on the behavior of the MigrationRecorder class in Django's migration system when using a database router. Specifically, it mentions that the MigrationRecorder should not create tables on databases other than the 'default' database when a router is in use.\n2. In the search results, we find the MigrationRecorder class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py'. This class has methods such as __init__, ensure_schema, which are directly related to the creation of the migration table.\n3. The issue states that ensure_schema() method should respect the database router's allow_migrate rule, but it seems to lack this check, leading to the table being created on all databases instead of just 'default'.\n4. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' is found, which uses MigrationRecorder and has methods like apply_migration and record_migration. These methods interact with the record_applied method of MigrationRecorder, which is crucial for the issue at hand.\n5. The ConnectionRouter class in 'django/db/utils.py' defines the allow_migrate method that should be consulted to decide whether a migration is allowed on a particular database. This class and its methods are relevant for implementing the desired behavior.\n6. Given these findings, the identified code spans are highly relevant as they directly pertain to the implementation of the migration system and the database router interactions in Django, which are central to the reported issue.",

The MigrationRecorder class in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, particularly the ensure_schema method, which checks for the existence of the migration table and attempts to create it if it does not exist. 2. The MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py, which interacts with the MigrationRecorder and applies migrations. 3. The ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py, which manages the router logic for database migrations. While this provides a good starting point to address the issue, further inspection of the interaction points between these components and the database configuration, including how the router decisions are enforced and checked in the context of multi-db setups, would be beneficial for a thorough solution.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
