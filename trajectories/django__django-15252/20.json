The provided search results contain a detailed look into the MigrationRecorder class in django/db/migrations/recorder.py which is central to the issue. The issue specifically highlights the method 'ensure_schema', which is responsible for checking and creating the Migration model table if it doesn't exist. This method does not take into account the database router's allow_migrate rules, which is the root cause of the problem. The code spans for 'MigrationRecorder.Migration', 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema', and 'MigrationRecorder.record_applied' (which also calls 'ensure_schema') are directly relevant to the reported issue as they all deal with the management and creation of the Migration table across different databases. Additionally, 'MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied' is also potentially problematic for the same reasons, making it relevant for further investigation. These pieces of code need to be adjusted to respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules. Thus, the identified span IDs are 'MigrationRecorder.Migration', 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema', 'MigrationRecorder.record_applied', and 'MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied'.",

This issue is crucial for maintaining data integrity across multiple databases where only specific ones should be subject to migrations.\n\nThe current analysis of the code shows core functionalities related to migrations and their recording in the django/db/migrations/recorder.py file, including the ensure_schema method which is responsible for creating the 'django_migrations' table if it doesn't exist. This method does not currently check the database router's allow_migrate rules before creating the table, which is a key aspect of the reported issue.\n\nIn the search results, additional relevant code spans are found in the django/db/utils.py file, which contain the implementation of the ConnectionRouter class handling database routing logic. The allow_migrate method within this class is critical because it defines the rules for which databases can run migrations, specifically allowing control over the migration process based on the router configurations. Integration of this logic into the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied methods would ensure that the migration table creation and recording adhere to the database router's rules.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans in both files are deemed relevant and necessary to address the issue. The focus should be on enhancing the MigrationRecorder to incorporate the routing logic checks before any schema-altering actions.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
