Specifically, it indicates that the MigrationRecorder attempts to create the django_migrations table on all connections, not just the 'default' connection, which is not the expected behavior given the provided router. This behavior appears to be due to the ensure_schema method within the MigrationRecorder class, which checks for the existence of the Migration model table and attempts to create it if it does not exist. There are also concerns that other methods like record_applied and record_unapplied might have similar issues. The search results include relevant code spans from django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/utils.py, and django/db/backends/base/creation.py, which cover the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, as well as the ConnectionRouter class which deals with db_router handling including allow_migrate.

This class is central to the migration recording process and includes methods such as ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied. The issue suggests that ensure_schema might not be respecting the db_router's allow_migrate rules when deciding whether to create a table on a specific database connection. The ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py also seems relevant as it contains the logic for routing decisions related to migrations (allow_migrate method), which should influence the behavior of the recorder. Lastly, django/db/backends/base/creation.py includes the BaseDatabaseCreation class, which is responsible for creating test databases and running migrations during tests, aligning with the reported behavior during the test setup.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
