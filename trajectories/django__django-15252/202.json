The router's allow_migrate method should control which databases migrations are applied to, but MigrationRecorder is creating tables on non-'default' databases. This needs to be investigated in the context of the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder, the apply_migration method in MigrationExecutor, and the setup_databases function in the test runner. The relevant classes and methods to inspect are MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and possibly ConnectionRouter.",

The `MigrationRecorder` is responsible for recording applied and unapplied migrations. When analyzing the search results, it's evident that the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods like `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` are central to the issue. These methods directly interact with the database to manage the `django_migrations` table, which is crucial for tracking applied migrations. However, they do not check the router's `allow_migrate` rule before performing database operations. This leads to the unwanted creation of the `django_migrations` table in non-default databases. The code spans related to these methods in the `MigrationRecorder` class are the most relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the `apply_migration` method in the `MigrationExecutor` class also interacts with the `MigrationRecorder` and could be a potential area of concern as it triggers the recording of migrations without considering the router rules.",

This could be problematic in a multi-db setup where some databases should not have migrations applied based on the router\u2019s rules. From `MigrationExecutor`, the `apply_migration` method also lacks any checks on the router\u2019s `allow_migrate` method before applying a migration.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
