The user expects that the Migration model table should not be created on any connection other than the 'default' connection when a router is provided. The search results provide critical insights into the relevant code spans. The 'MigrationRecorder' class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' contains methods 'ensure_schema', 'applied_migrations', and 'record_applied' which are directly related to the issue. The 'ensure_schema' method checks if the Migration model is in the tables and tries to create the table if it's missing, which is the core behavior contradicting the user's expectation. Additionally, the 'MigrationExecutor' class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' interacts with the 'MigrationRecorder' and has methods like 'apply_migration' and 'record_migration' that involve recording applied migrations, further relevant to the issue. The 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' defines the 'allow_migrate' method, which should be consulted to ensure that migrations are only applied to the allowed databases. Overall, these code spans are highly relevant and provide a comprehensive view of how migrations are applied and recorded in Django, aligning directly with the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
