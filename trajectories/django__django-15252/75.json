This results in tables being created on connections other than the 'default' connection, which is not the expected behavior. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations, which interact with the database schema and migration records. We also need to consider the ConnectionRouter and its allow_migrate method, which determines whether migrations are allowed on a given database. The search should concentrate on these classes and methods to identify where the logic is being bypassed or incorrectly applied.",

The ensure_schema method is responsible for creating the django_migrations table if it doesn't exist, and it does this without checking the DB router's allow_migrate rules.

The current behavior is that the table is created on all connections, not just the 'default' one as specified by the router. The analysis of the provided code spans indicates that the core functionality related to the MigrationRecorder is found in the 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' file. Specifically, the 'ensure_schema' method in the MigrationRecorder class is responsible for creating the 'django_migrations' table if it doesn't exist. This method does not currently check the database router's 'allow_migrate' rules before attempting to create the table. Additionally, the 'record_applied' method calls 'ensure_schema', suggesting that any changes to 'ensure_schema' will affect this method as well. The 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' file contains the 'apply_migration' method, which uses the MigrationRecorder's 'record_applied' method, reinforcing the need for the 'ensure_schema' method to respect the router's rules. Finally, the 'django/db/utils.py' file contains the 'ConnectionRouter' class, which includes the 'allow_migrate' method that the MigrationRecorder should consult before creating the table. To address the issue, the 'ensure_schema' method should be updated to check with the ConnectionRouter's 'allow_migrate' method before deciding to create the table.",

The issue specifically mentions the 'ensure_schema' method creating tables on non-default databases, which should be prevented by the router's allow_migrate method. In the search results, there are several relevant code spans that are critical to address this issue:\n\n1. 'MigrationRecorder' class definition and its methods: This class is central to the problem as it is responsible for recording migrations and ensuring the schema exists. The 'ensure_schema' method directly creates the migration table if it does not exist, which is where the problem originates.\n\n2. 'MigrationExecutor' class and its methods: This class uses the MigrationRecorder and is responsible for executing migrations. Methods like 'record_migration', 'apply_migration', and 'unapply_migration' interact with the MigrationRecorder and could potentially bypass the router's rules.\n\nGiven these details, the identified code spans are:\n- 'MigrationRecorder' class and its methods: 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', 'record_unapplied'.\n- 'MigrationExecutor' class and its methods: 'record_migration', 'apply_migration', 'unapply_migration'.\n\nThese spans are relevant because they directly interact with the database and control the creation and recording of migration tables and records. The goal would be to ensure these methods respect the 'allow_migrate' rule defined in the router.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
