The key concern is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the 'allow_migrate' rule of the router and creates the 'django_migrations' table on all connections, not just the 'default' one as expected. The provided search results include the relevant code spans from 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/utils.py'. In 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', the MigrationRecorder class contains methods related to ensuring the schema, recording applied and unapplied migrations, and checking if the table exists. These methods are critical for understanding how the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database and why it might be creating tables in unintended databases. The 'django/db/utils.py' file contains the ConnectionRouter class, which is responsible for routing database operations based on the database router settings. This includes the 'allow_migrate' method, which is directly related to the behavior being discussed in the issue. The provided code spans are sufficient to understand and address the reported issue, particularly the 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', 'record_unapplied', and 'allow_migrate' methods.",

This directly aligns with the issue's description of the table being created improperly based on the db_router rules. Additionally, the 'django/db/utils.py' file contains the ConnectionRouter class which includes methods for allowing migrations as per the router configurations. While the specific custom router code from the issue is not provided (only a snippet of what it might look like), the context provided is sufficient to understand the integration points and potential discrepancies with the db_router.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
