The main concern is that the `MigrationRecorder` tries to create tables on non-'default' connections, which should not happen according to the provided router configuration. To address this, we need to focus on the `MigrationRecorder` class in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and the `allow_migrate` method in the `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py`. Additionally, the `apply_migration` method in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` should be checked to ensure it respects the router's decisions.",

The relevant code spans can be found in the django/db/migrations/recorder.py file, where the MigrationRecorder class and its methods (ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied) are located. These methods are directly involved in ensuring the schema, recording applied and unapplied migrations, and manipulating the django_migrations table. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py and the MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py might also be relevant as they deal with routing connections and applying migrations, respectively.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
