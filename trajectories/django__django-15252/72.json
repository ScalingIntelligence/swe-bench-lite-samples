            "scratch_pad": "The issue pertains to the behavior of Django's MigrationRecorder class in a multi-db setup where a custom DB router has been implemented to control table creation across different databases. Specifically, the MigrationRecorder is not respecting the 'allow_migrate' rules defined in the router, leading to tables being created in non-'default' databases. To address this, the search should focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly those related to schema creation and migration recording. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class and its 'allow_migrate' method should be examined, as well as any relevant methods in the MigrationExecutor class since it interacts directly with the MigrationRecorder during migrations. The search should also consider files related to database creation and management commands that might influence this behavior.",

The reported issue specifically points to the `ensure_schema` method in the MigrationRecorder class, which does not check the allow_migrate rule before attempting to create the migration table. Additionally, the methods `record_applied` and `record_unapplied`, which call `ensure_schema`, may also exhibit this incorrect behavior. The search results provided contain the relevant code spans in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/utils.py`. The `MigrationRecorder` class in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` includes the `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` methods, which are directly related to the issue. Additionally, the `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` includes the `allow_migrate` method, indicating that the router logic is considered in this search.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
