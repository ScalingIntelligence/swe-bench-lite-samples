Specifically, the router's allow_migrate rule is not being respected, leading to migrations being recorded and applied to databases that should be excluded. Key areas to investigate include the MigrationRecorder class, which is responsible for recording the application of migrations, and the MigrationExecutor, which applies migrations. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter and database creation logic should be examined to ensure compliance with router rules. Focus on ensuring that tables for the Migration model are not created on non-default databases and that migration records are not applied inappropriately across different databases.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the MigrationRecorder in a multi-db setup where the db router should dictate which database should have the Migration table created. The issue is that the Migration table is being created in databases other than the 'default' one, which is against the router rules. The search results provide key insights into the relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n1. **MigrationExecutor Class (`django/db/migrations/executor.py`)**: This class is central to the migration execution process and uses the MigrationRecorder to record applied migrations. Specifically, the `apply_migration` method is where the recorder's `record_applied` method is called, indicating a direct relationship between applying migrations and recording them.\n\n2. **MigrationRecorder Class (`django/db/migrations/recorder.py`)**: This class is responsible for recording migration actions in the database. The `record_applied` method calls `ensure_schema`, which checks for and creates the Migration table if it doesn't exist. This method is crucial as it bypasses the db router's allow_migrate rules.\n\n3. **BaseDatabaseCreation Class (`django/db/backends/base/creation.py`)**: This class is involved in creating test databases, which involves calling the migrate command. Understanding how test databases are set up and migrated could help identify where the process might be ignoring router rules.\n\n4. **DatabaseCreation Class (`django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py`)**: This class extends BaseDatabaseCreation and provides SQLite-specific behavior, potentially relevant if SQLite is one of the DBs in use.\n\nGiven these findings, the focus should primarily be on the `MigrationRecorder` and `MigrationExecutor` classes, as they directly handle the recording and application of migrations. The `record_applied` method in `MigrationRecorder` should be adjusted to respect the db router's allow_migrate rules. Additionally, reviewing how migrations are applied in test environments (as in `BaseDatabaseCreation`) could reveal further areas for improvement.",

The issue arises when the MigrationRecorder tries to ensure the schema, which may result in the creation of tables in non-'default' databases, contrary to the router's rules. The relevant sections of the codebase involve the MigrationExecutor and MigrationRecorder classes in django/db/migrations/executor.py and django/db/migrations/recorder.py respectively. The MigrationExecutor's apply_migration method calls self.record_migration, which in turn calls the MigrationRecorder's record_applied.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
