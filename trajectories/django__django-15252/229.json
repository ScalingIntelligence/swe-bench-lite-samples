The expectation is that tables should only be created in the 'default' database connection, never in the other connections. However, the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method attempts to create tables in other connections if they don't already exist, which contradicts the router's rules. The relevant files and methods to investigate are MigrationRecorder in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, allow_migrate in django/db/utils.py, and apply_migration in django/db/migrations/executor.py. The search should focus on these specific methods and files to pinpoint where the respect for the router's rules may be lacking.",

The issue specifically points out that even when a router specifies that migrations should only be applied to the 'default' database, the `MigrationRecorder` attempts to create the table in other databases. This behavior is demonstrated in the `ensure_schema` method of the `MigrationRecorder` class, where it checks if the table exists and, if not, attempts to create it without respect to the router's rules. The search results show several relevant spans of code: `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema` shows the logic that checks for the table and creates it if it doesn't exist, `MigrationRecorder.record_applied` and `MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied` involve attempts to record migrations, which could trigger the `ensure_schema` method, and `MigrationExecutor.apply_migration` and `MigrationExecutor.migrate` are responsible for executing migrations and ensuring the schema, both of which call upon the `MigrationRecorder`. Additionally, `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate` provides the logic for determining if a migration should be allowed on a particular database, reinforcing the need to ensure that the `MigrationRecorder` respects these decisions.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
