The code in django/db/migrations/recorder.py contains the MigrationRecorder class with methods such as ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied, which are all potentially involved in handling migration records and their schema. The code in django/db/migrations/executor.py includes the MigrationExecutor class with methods related to applying and unapplying migrations, which interact with the MigrationRecorder. The relevance of these parts of the code is confirmed by their direct involvement in the migration process and interaction with the database schema, as described in the reported issue.

The ensure_schema method could potentially be causing the issues mentioned regarding the creation of tables on non-'default' databases, which should be prevented by the router's allow_migrate rules. The MigrationExecutor class, particularly its methods that interact with the MigrationRecorder, should respect the router's rules, but it seems that there might be a gap in its implementation as described in the issue.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
