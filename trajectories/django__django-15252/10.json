The problem occurs when the test databases are created and the migrate command is called against each connection. The MigrationRecorder attempts to create a table for the Migration model on connections other than 'default', which is incorrect behavior when a db_router is provided. To address this, we need to look into the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method, the executor's apply_migration method, and the creation of test databases in the test runner setup.",

The issue describes that despite the presence of a database router that should restrict table creation to the 'default' database, the Migration model's table is being created on other connections. This disobeys the allow_migrate rules set by the router. The search results include the relevant code spans from django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py. These spans show the ensure_schema method, which is responsible for checking and creating the Migration table, and the apply_migration method, which calls record_applied, both key components of the migration process. Additionally, the search results from django/db/backends/base/creation.py provide context on how test databases are created and migrated, which is relevant to the issue as it involves testing setup. The identified spans from these files are critical to understanding and fixing the issue with the MigrationRecorder not obeying db_router rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
