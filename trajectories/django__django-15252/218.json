This causes the creation of the Migration table in databases other than the 'default' one, which is undesired in a multi-db setup. The relevant files and methods appear to be in the django.db.migrations and django.db.utils modules. Specifically, we should look into the MigrationRecorder class and its methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter and its allow_migrate method could also be relevant. The MigrationExecutor class and its apply_migration method should also be examined as it interacts with the MigrationRecorder.",

Specifically, the issue mentions that when ensuring the schema, the table should only be created on the 'default' connection. This behavior is controlled by the allow_migrate method in the Router class, which should return False for non-default databases. The relevant code spans provided in the search results primarily focus on the MigrationRecorder class, which includes methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied, all of which interact with the database schema and records. The ConnectionRouter class also appears relevant as it handles routing decisions, including allow_migrate.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
