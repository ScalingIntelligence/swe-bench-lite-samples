Specifically, the Migration model table is being created in databases other than the 'default' one, despite the router's rules. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, especially ensure_schema(), record_applied(), and applied_migrations(). Additionally, the ConnectionRouter and MigrationExecutor classes are relevant for understanding how migrations are applied and how database routers influence this process. We should search for instances of these classes and methods to pinpoint where the behavior deviates from the expected.",

The issue points out that when migrations are applied during the creation of test databases, the `MigrationRecorder` should not create tables on connections other than the 'default' connection. The provided search results contain relevant sections of code from `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, `django/db/utils.py`, and `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. In `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, the methods `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` are likely responsible for handling the creation and recording of migration tables. These methods call `self.ensure_schema()`, which checks if the migration table exists and creates it if it doesn't. This behavior is central to the issue, as it affects whether the table is created on the correct database connection. In `django/db/utils.py`, the `ConnectionRouter` class and its methods like `allow_migrate` are relevant for understanding how database routing decisions are made. Finally, in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class and its methods interact with the `MigrationRecorder` and handle the application of migrations, which is closely related to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
