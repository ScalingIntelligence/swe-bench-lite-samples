The issue highlights that the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method, invoked by record_applied, incorrectly creates the django_migrations table on non-'default' databases even when the router should prevent it. This is evident in the ensure_schema method that checks for the table's presence and attempts to create it if absent, without consulting the db router. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class, responsible for applying migrations, uses the MigrationRecorder without considering the router's allow_migrate rules. To address this, one would need to modify the ensure_schema method to first check the router's allow_migrate rule before creating the table. Also, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration method, which calls record_applied, should respect the router's decisions. The search results clearly show the problematic methods without any direct checks against the router, indicating the need for changes.",

The key points from the issue are: 1. A router is defined to only allow migrations on the 'default' database. 2. During tests, migrations are attempted on all connections, including those where migrations should not be allowed. 3. The MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method checks for the presence of the Migration model table and creates it if it does not exist, regardless of the db_router settings. This behavior is incorrect based on the router's rules. 4. There are concerns about similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied methods.\n\nIn the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the following files and spans:\n\n1. django/db/migrations/recorder.py: This file contains the MigrationRecorder class with methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied. These methods are directly related to recording and ensuring the schema for migrations. Specifically, the ensure_schema method should check the db_router's allow_migrate rules before attempting to create the django_migrations table.\n\n2. django/db/migrations/executor.py: This file contains the MigrationExecutor class with methods like apply_migration and _create_project_state. These methods are responsible for applying migrations and creating project states, which should also respect the db_router's settings.\n\n3. django/db/utils.py: This file contains the ConnectionRouter class, which includes methods like allow_migrate, allow_migrate_model, and get_migratable_models that are relevant for determining which databases are allowed to run migrations based on the rules defined in the router.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified spans are key to understanding and addressing the issue reported.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the behavior of the MigrationRecorder and its related methods when dealing with a multi-database setup and the application of migration records based on the db_router. The initial analysis shows that the MigrationRecorder creates the 'django_migrations' table on any database connection without considering the db_router rules. This violates the expectation that tables should only be created on the 'default' connection according to the provided router logic. The current implementation of MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema() directly creates the table if it does not exist, without consulting the router's allow_migrate method. This results in unintended table creation on non-'default' connections during migration recording, which the user wants to prevent. Additional related methods like record_applied and record_unapplied also call ensure_schema directly, reinforcing this behavior. The relevant file context and search results indicate a focus on the recorder.py and executor.py files, which are essential for handling migrations and recording their application. The search results expand upon these initial findings, revealing the explicit creation of the Migration model table and the methods responsible for recording applied and unapplied migrations. Understanding these aspects is crucial for both diagnosing the current issue and devising a solution. This comprehensive review suggests that the current implementation does not align with the user's requirement for respecting db_router rules in migration recording operations across multiple databases.",

Specifically, the MigrationRecorder class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' contains methods like 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied', which directly interact with the database schema and record migration status. These methods currently lack the required check against the 'allow_migrate' rules from the db_router. Similarly, the MigrationExecutor class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' contains the 'apply_migration' method, which also interacts with the schema and records the migration status without the 'allow_migrate' check. Given these observations, it appears that the file context is relevant but incomplete as it doesn't cover all possible interactions that need to be modified to respect the 'allow_migrate' rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
