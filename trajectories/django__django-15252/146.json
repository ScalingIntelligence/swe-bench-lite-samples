The focus should be on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods like ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied. Also, the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method should be examined for proper routing of database operations. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class, especially its apply_migration method, should be checked as it invokes the MigrationRecorder's methods. Lastly, the setup_databases function in django/test/runner.py might be relevant as it orchestrates the creation of test databases which triggers migrations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on the behavior of the MigrationRecorder class in relation to the customization provided by a database router. The router is designed to manage allow_migrate rules such that tables should only be created in the 'default' database, not in any other configured databases. The issue points out that the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method attempts to create a table in all databases regardless of the router's rules. This behavior is observed when running functional tests that call the migrate command on each database connection.\n\nI will now analyze the provided search results to identify the relevant code spans within the MigrationRecorder class and related methods in the search results. First, I will review the MigrationRecorder class itself to identify methods that are responsible for ensuring the schema and recording migrations. Secondly, I will look for methods in other classes that interact with or use MigrationRecorder methods.\n\nThe search results provide code involving the MigrationRecorder class and related functionalities within multiple files. Key methods to focus on include ensure_schema (which directly deals with schema ensuring), and record_applied (which records that a migration has been applied and calls ensure_schema).\n\nAlso, I need to check the MigrationExecutor class, which is responsible for running migrations and uses MigrationRecorder. This is important because this class could enforce or bypass the router's rules when applying migrations.\n\nUpon reviewing these sections, I will identify which parts are directly related to the issue of not obeying db_router allow_migrate rules and decide whether the task is complete based on the amount of relevant code identified.\n\nThe critical spans are those in django/db/migrations/recorder.py (#ensure_schema, #record_applied, #has_table) and in django/db/migrations/executor.py (#migrate, #apply_migration) as they detail the process of schema enforcement and migration application which directly interacts with the database's schema and is likely where the issue occurs.\n\nAdditionally, consider parts of the code in django/db/utils.py concerning ConnectionRouter, specifically #allow_migrate and #allow_migrate_model, as these methods involve routing decisions that should ideally control where migrations are applied.\n\nThe analysis of the provided code confirms my suspicion that the ensure_schema method of MigrationRecorder does not respect the decision-making of the router in terms of which database to manipulate - this could be the point of failure. Furthermore, the interaction with the MigrationExecutor class in managing the migration process strengthens the case that this is indeed the source of the behavior described in the issue.",

This implies that tables related to migrations are being created on databases other than the 'default' one, which goes against the specified router's logic. The key to identifying relevant code spans is looking for interactions with the MigrationRecorder, especially methods that deal with creating or checking for the presence of migration-related tables. Additionally, it's important to check how the db_router's rules are being applied and whether they are correctly integrated into the migration process.\n\n1. **MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema**: This method is critical as it checks for the presence of the migration table and creates it if it doesn't exist. It should respect the db_router rules, so understanding how it interacts with the database connection is essential.\n2. **MigrationExecutor**: It uses the MigrationRecorder and should ideally consider the db_router's allow_migrate rule when executing migrations.\n3. **ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate**: This method in the db_router decides whether a migration is allowed on a given database. Its implementation and interactions are crucial.\n\nBy focusing on these sections, we can determine whether the code correctly respects the db_router's rules and identify potential areas of improvement.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
