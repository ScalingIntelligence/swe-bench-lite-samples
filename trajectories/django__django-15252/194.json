            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a multi-db setup where Django should only create tables in the 'default' connection, but it currently creates tables in other connections as well. This behavior is due to the MigrationRecorder not obeying the db_router's allow_migrate rules. The key files and methods involved are: \n\n1. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` - This file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class which is responsible for ensuring the schema and recording applied migrations. The critical methods here are `ensure_schema` and `record_applied`. The `ensure_schema` method checks if the Migration model is in the tables and tries to create it if absent, which should be conditional based on the db_router's allow_migrate rules.\n\n2. `django/db/migrations/executor.py` - This file contains the `MigrationExecutor` class which uses `MigrationRecorder` to apply migrations. The method `apply_migration` calls `self.recorder.record_applied`, which triggers the `ensure_schema` check and potential table creation.\n\n3. `django/db/utils.py` - This file contains the `ConnectionRouter` class which is the implementation of the db_router. The method `allow_migrate` should be consulted to ensure that migrations are only applied to allowed databases.\n\nThe analysis reveals that the `ensure_schema` method in `MigrationRecorder` should incorporate the logic of checking the `allow_migrate` rule before attempting to create the schema. Additionally, methods like `record_applied` and possibly `record_unapplied` should also respect the db_router's rules to prevent table creation in unauthorized databases.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified relevant code spans are all from the 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' file, focusing on the methods `ensure_schema` and `record_applied`. These methods need to be updated to respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
