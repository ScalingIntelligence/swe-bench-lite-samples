This results in tables being created in non-'default' databases. The focus should be on the methods within MigrationRecorder and how they interact with the database connections and routers. Specific methods like ensure_schema and record_applied should be examined. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor and its interactions with the recorder should be checked. The ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method is central to this issue, so understanding how it's used in the context of migrations is crucial.",

The search results provide relevant code spans within the `MigrationRecorder` class in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and the `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. The key methods to focus on are `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` in `MigrationRecorder`, and `migrate`, `apply_migration`, and `unapply_migration` in `MigrationExecutor`. These methods directly involve the recording and application of migrations, where the issue might occur if the router's rules are not properly followed. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` is also relevant as it provides the logic for routing database operations based on the configured routers, including `allow_migrate`. This class determines which database a migration should be applied to and whether a migration should be applied at all. The provided code spans are sufficiently relevant to address the issue, covering the necessary functionality related to migration recording, application, and database routing. However, the code lacks specific checks within the `ensure_schema` method to consult the `allow_migrate` methods of the configured routers before creating the schema. This gap might be where an issue could occur, as the current implementation only checks for the existence of the table and tries to create it if it's missing, without consulting the database router first.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
