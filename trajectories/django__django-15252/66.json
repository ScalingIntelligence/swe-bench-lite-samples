The MigrationRecorder should respect the router's allow_migrate rules but seems to incorrectly create tables on non-'default' connections. To address this, we need to trace how the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database during migrations and ensure it adheres to the db_router rules. We should focus on the MigrationRecorder class, the MigrationExecutor class, and the ConnectionRouter class to understand where the issue arises. Specifically, we'll look for any calls to self.recorder.record_applied in the MigrationExecutor class and how the MigrationRecorder handles schema creation.",

The user expects that the Migration model (and its table) should only be created on the 'default' database, as per the router's allow_migrate rules. However, the current behavior involves attempts to create this table on all databases, which is incorrect according to the user. \n\nUpon examining the provided search results, two main files are highlighted: django/db/migrations/executor.py and django/db/migrations/recorder.py. These files contain the core functionality related to applying migrations and recording their application. \n\nIn executor.py, the MigrationExecutor class is defined, and its methods involve applying migrations and recording them. Specifically, the apply_migration method calls self.recorder.record_applied, which is crucial as it checks and ensures the schema exists before recording the migration. This aligns directly with the user's concern about the behavior of MigrationRecorder regarding schema creation across databases.\n\nIn recorder.py, the MigrationRecorder class contains methods like ensure_schema and record_applied. The ensure_schema method, in particular, checks if the Migration table exists and attempts to create it if it doesn't. This is the exact behavior the user finds problematic as it disregards the database router's allow_migrate rules. \n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are crucial to address the issue as they directly involve the methods and functionalities that need to be corrected or properly handle the database routing decisions.",

The main focus is on the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder class, which is responsible for checking and creating the django_migrations table. The issue indicates that this table is being created on all databases, not just the 'default' one, which conflicts with the allow_migrate rules defined in the custom router.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided code spans and the issue description, it is clear that the core issue lies in the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder class. This method does not take into account the database router's allow_migrate rules before attempting to create the django_migrations table. The relevant code spans include the entire MigrationRecorder class definition and its methods, especially ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class methods that interact with MigrationRecorder, such as apply_migration and migrate, are also relevant as they call the ensure_schema method directly or indirectly.\n\nThe identified code spans are crucial for understanding the current behavior and for potential modifications to align with the custom db router's rules. The search task is considered complete as the identified code spans sufficiently cover the context needed to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
