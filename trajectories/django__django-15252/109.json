The user expects that the migrations are only recorded on the 'default' database based on the router's `allow_migrate` rules. However, the MigrationRecorder currently attempts to create a table on all connections, which goes against the router's intentions.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, we can see the relevant code spans in the following files:\n- `django/db/migrations/executor.py`: This file contains the `MigrationExecutor` class which is responsible for applying migrations. The `apply_migration` method directly interacts with the `MigrationRecorder`.\n- `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`: This file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class which is responsible for recording migrations and ensuring the schema. The `record_applied` method calls `ensure_schema`, which in turn checks for the existence of the Migration table and attempts to create it if it doesn't exist.\n- `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`: This file contains the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class which is responsible for creating test databases. The `create_test_db` method calls the `migrate` command, which triggers the migration process.\n\nFrom the reported issue, it is clear that the current behavior of `MigrationRecorder` does not respect the `db_router`'s `allow_migrate` rules, which is a critical part of the issue. The relevant code spans should be those that deal with applying and recording migrations, especially those that create tables or otherwise interact with the database schema.",

Specifically, it points out that the Migration model's table is being created on non-'default' databases, which should not occur based on the provided router. The issue analysis leads to several relevant components in the Django codebase: 1. **MigrationExecutor**: This class is responsible for executing migrations and initializing the MigrationRecorder. 2. **MigrationRecorder**: This class manages recording applied migrations and includes the ensure_schema method, which checks for the Migration model's table and creates it if missing. 3. **BaseDatabaseCreation**: This class is involved in creating test databases and runs migrations during this process. The new search results provide additional context around the management commands for migrations: 1. **migrate**: This command handles the application of migrations and initializes the MigrationExecutor. 2. **makemigrations**: This command is responsible for creating new migration files. The relevance of these components stems from their direct involvement in the migration process, which is central to the issue at hand. The MigrationExecutor and MigrationRecorder classes are particularly key as they manage the state and recording of migrations, which should respect the database router's rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
