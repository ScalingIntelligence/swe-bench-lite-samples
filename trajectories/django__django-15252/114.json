            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on the MigrationRecorder class in Django's migration system, specifically around the 'ensure_schema' method. The issue describes that when the test databases are created, the MigrationRecorder attempts to create the django_migrations table on all connections instead of just the 'default' connection, despite the presence of a router that should restrict this behavior to the 'default' database only. This is a clear mismatch with the router's allow_migrate rules. The search results provided include relevant code spans from three files: 'django/db/utils.py', 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. The 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' is responsible for managing database routing rules. The 'MigrationRecorder' class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' contains methods like 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied', which demonstrate how the recorder tries to ensure the schema, record applied migrations, and unapplied migrations. Additionally, methods from the 'MigrationExecutor' class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' showcase how migrations are executed and the recording of migration history. These code spans cover the functionalities highlighted in the reported issue, such as schema checks, record management (applied and unapplied migrations), as well as the execution of migration processes. The inclusion of the 'MigrationRecorder' class's 'Migration' model definition, the 'ConnectionRouter' class rules and logic, and the 'MigrationExecutor' class's handling of migrations ensures that all critical aspects of the issue are addressed. Therefore, I mark these spans as relevant to find the comprehensibility required to provide an attempt to start to solve the issue.",

Specifically, it points out that the table 'django_migrations' is being created in databases other than the 'default' one when migrations are applied. The issue suggests that the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder should adhere to the router's allow_migrate rules before creating the table.\n\nAnalysis of the current context reveals that the MigrationRecorder class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' is responsible for recording applied migrations and ensuring the necessary schema. The ensure_schema method checks if the table exists and creates it if it does not, which is where the problem lies. This method does not check if the current database allows for this migration.\n\nThe new search results confirm the existence of the MigrationRecorder class and its methods in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py'. The most relevant span is 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema', which is where the changes should be made to ensure that the schema creation respects the allow_migrate rules.\n\nFor the MigrationExecutor class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py', the most relevant spans are 'MigrationExecutor.apply_migration' and 'MigrationExecutor.record_migration', as these methods interact directly with the MigrationRecorder and could potentially be where additional checks should be integrated to enforce the router's rules.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the identified spans are relevant to addressing the problem. However, it seems that further exploration of the interaction between the MigrationRecorder and the Database Router within the MigrationExecutor could yield more insights and a more comprehensive solution.",

Methods such as `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` all potentially create or modify schema without considering whether they should act based on the current database alias. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class's methods like `apply_migration` and `record_migration` invoke the MigrationRecorder's methods without considering the router's decision on which databases are eligible for migrations. This oversight could lead to schema changes on databases not intended for migrations, which is against the specified behavior. However, the provided file context does not include the specific methods in the MigrationRecorder or MigrationExecutor classes that directly call the router's `allow_migrate` method.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
