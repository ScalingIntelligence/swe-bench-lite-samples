This router prevents migrations from being applied to non-default databases. The key points from the issue highlight that the MigrationRecorder's schema creation logic does not check db router rules before creating tables, specifically regarding the `django_migrations` table.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results:\n- The `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class which is central to this issue. The methods `ensure_schema`, `applied_migrations`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` are all relevant as they either directly interact with the `django_migrations` table or are involved in the migration recording process.\n- In `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class method `apply_migration` is crucial as it calls the `record_applied` method of the `MigrationRecorder`, which is the method identified as problematic in the issue. Additionally, the `migrate` method in the same file is relevant as it initiates the migration process.\n- The `django/db/utils.py` file does not directly contain code that checks or enforces the `allow_migrate` rules but defines the `ConnectionRouter` which manages database routing, including the `allow_migrate` method.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans cover the core functionality related to the issue. However, while the `ConnectionRouter` is mentioned, the specific implementation of the custom router from the issue is not provided. It's assumed that integration with the `ConnectionRouter` is already in place and the focus is on the `MigrationRecorder` class in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to ensure it respects the database routing rules set by the `ConnectionRouter`.\n\nTherefore, I will recommend the relevant code spans to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
