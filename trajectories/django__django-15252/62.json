The MigrationRecorder is incorrectly creating tables on non-'default' connections when it should obey the router's allow_migrate rules. The search should focus on the MigrationRecorder class and related methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations, as well as the context where these methods are called in the migration process (like in django/db/migrations/executor.py and django/db/backends/creation.py). Additional focus should be on the router logic in django/db/utils.py to ensure allow_migrate is respected.",

Specifically, the issue highlights that the MigrationRecorder attempts to create tables in databases other than the 'default' one despite the router's rule to only allow migrations in the 'default' database. This discrepancy needs to be addressed to uphold the intended behavior of the database router.\n\nFrom the search results, it's evident that several key files and methods are involved in the migration process. The MigrationRecorder class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' contains critical methods like 'ensure_schema' and 'record_applied' that interact with the database schema directly. The 'ensure_schema' method checks if the Migration model table exists in the current database and creates it if it does not, which is the primary focus of the issue as it bypasses the database router's rules. Additionally, the 'record_applied' method indirectly calls 'ensure_schema', making it another relevant span to consider.\n\nIn 'django/db/migrations/executor.py', the MigrationExecutor class interacts with the MigrationRecorder, particularly in methods like 'apply_migration' and 'record_migration', both of which are pivotal in handling migrations and thus relevant to the issue.\n\nFinally, 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' contains code responsible for creating test databases, which also calls the migrate command, making it potentially relevant to how migrations are applied in test environments.\n\nGiven these insights, the identified spans directly relate to the logic responsible for handling and recording migrations, which aligns with the reported issue's concern. Therefore, these spans should be sufficient to address the issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
