The user expects that the router's allow_migrate rules would prevent the creation of migration tables in databases other than the 'default' one. However, the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method does not seem to respect these rules and attempts to create the migration table in all databases. The relevant code spans to address this issue are primarily in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, specifically the ensure_schema method within the MigrationRecorder class. This method checks if the Migration model is in the tables of the connection and, if not, tries to create the table, which is the behavior the user identifies as problematic. The other relevant code span is in django/db/backends/base/creation.py within the create_test_db method, as this method calls the migrate command which triggers the behavior in question during test database creation. The ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method in django/db/utils.py is also relevant for understanding how the router rules are supposed to be applied but does not directly address the issue of ensuring these rules are respected in the MigrationRecorder's methods.",

Specifically, the issue is that the `MigrationRecorder` does not respect the `allow_migrate` rules set by the database router, leading to tables being created on non-'default' databases. \n\nUpon examining the provided code, we find that the `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema` method is responsible for checking if the `Migration` model table exists in the database and creating it if it does not. This action does not consult the database router, which is the root cause of the issue. The relevant code spans for this issue are:\n1. `MigrationRecorder.__init__` which initializes the `MigrationRecorder` with a database connection.\n2. `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema` which checks for the `Migration` model table and creates it if missing.\n3. `MigrationRecorder.record_applied` which records that a migration has been applied, invoking `ensure_schema` first.\n\nAdditionally, the `BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db` method is relevant as it calls the migrate command during the creation of test databases, which triggers the problematic behavior. The `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate` method, though not directly at fault, is relevant to understand how the router is supposed to work. No new code spans were found in the search results that weren't already in the file context.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
