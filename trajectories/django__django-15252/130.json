The key points involve ensuring that the migrations table is only created on the 'default' connection as dictated by the router's allow_migrate rule. The relevant sections of code are primarily in django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py. In recorder.py, the ensure_schema method is critical as it attempts to create the migrations table if it doesn't exist, without checking the router's allow_migrate rule. Additionally, the record_applied method calls ensure_schema, making it part of the problem chain. In executor.py, the apply_migration and record_migration methods both interact with the MigrationRecorder, potentially triggering the problematic behavior. The ConnectionRouter in django/db/utils.py is also relevant as it defines the allow_migrate method that should influence the MigrationRecorder's behavior but currently does not. These sections of code are directly relevant to the issue as they need to be updated to ensure that the db router's rules are respected when deciding where to create or manipulate the migrations table.",

Specifically, the expectation is that tables should not be created on connections other than the 'default' connection when a router is provided. The provided context and search results contain key parts of the codebase relevant to this issue. The MigrationRecorder class methods ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied are crucial for understanding how migrations are recorded and tables are created. The MigrationExecutor class is also relevant as it interacts with the MigrationRecorder during the migration process. The allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter class is the central piece to enforce the db_router rules. It is evident from the search results that the MigrationRecorder does not currently check the db_router's rules before creating tables, which aligns with the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant spans to address this issue are those within the ensure_schema and record_applied methods of the MigrationRecorder class.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
