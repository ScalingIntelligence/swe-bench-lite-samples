The expectation is that migrations should only be applied to the 'default' database, but the MigrationRecorder seems to attempt to create tables on non-'default' databases, which goes against the DB router's rules. To address this, we need to search for the relevant parts of the code where the decision to create tables or record migrations is made, especially focusing on the methods of the MigrationRecorder class and the related DB router behavior.",

Specifically, the issue highlights that the `MigrationRecorder` does not respect the `allow_migrate` rules specified in the router, leading to tables being created in non-'default' connections. This behavior is observed in the `ensure_schema`, `applied_migrations`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` methods of the `MigrationRecorder` class. The current implementation of `ensure_schema` does not check the `allow_migrate` rule before trying to create the table, which is the core issue. Additionally, the `ConnectionRouter` class and its methods like `allow_migrate` and `allow_migrate_model` are likely involved in routing decisions for migrations. The `Operation.allow_migrate_model` method also interacts with the router to determine if a model can be migrated on a given connection. These parts of the code are crucial for understanding how the migration process interacts with the router and how the router's rules are applied (or not applied).",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
