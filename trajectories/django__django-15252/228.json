The MigrationRecorder should respect the rules defined in the router for allowing migrations. Specifically, it should not create tables in databases other than the 'default' when a router is in place. The focus should be on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations, as well as the interaction with the MigrationExecutor and the creation of test databases. The search should target these specific classes and methods to identify where the logic might be failing to respect the db_router rules.",

The router has a specific behavior where it only allows migrations on the 'default' database. The issue arises when the MigrationRecorder tries to create the migration table on databases other than 'default' during the test setup. The relevant code spans are found in django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py. In django/db/migrations/recorder.py, the methods ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied are key as they manage the creation of the migration table and recording of applied/unapplied migrations. In django/db/migrations/executor.py, the methods apply_migration and record_migration are relevant as they utilize the MigrationRecorder to apply and record migrations, which could lead to the table being created on unintended databases. The code in django/db/backends/base/creation.py is less relevant to the immediate issue but shows how test databases are created and destroyed, potentially influencing the environment in which migrations are applied. The identified code spans directly relate to the behavior described in the issue and should be addressed to ensure that the migration table is only created on the 'default' database as specified by the router.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
