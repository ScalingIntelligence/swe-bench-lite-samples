Specifically, it seems that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules, leading to tables being created in databases other than the 'default'. To address this issue, we need to locate the relevant code in the MigrationRecorder and its interaction with the db router. Given the provided context, we should focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly those involved in recording and ensuring schema, such as ensure_schema(), record_applied(), and applied_migrations(). Additionally, it would be beneficial to examine the ConnectionRouter class for its allow_migrate method.",

Specifically, the issue highlights that the MigrationRecorder should not create tables in databases other than the 'default' when a router is provided. To address this, I've analyzed the provided code spans from 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/utils.py'. The relevant parts include the MigrationRecorder class and its methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied, which directly involve the creation and manipulation of the 'django_migrations' table. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method are critical as they determine the databases where migrations are allowed. This analysis suggests that while the MigrationRecorder checks for the presence of the 'django_migrations' table and attempts to create it if missing, it does not consider the db_router's rules before doing so. This oversight could lead to the creation of tables in unintended databases. Therefore, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue around the MigrationRecorder's behavior in relation to the db_router.",

These methods appear to be the main focus of the reported issue regarding the creation of migration tables across different databases. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class in the 'django/db/utils.py' file includes the allow_migrate method, which is central to the db_router functionality.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
