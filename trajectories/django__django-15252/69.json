The problem arises during the setup of test databases when migrations are applied, and the MigrationRecorder tries to ensure the schema by creating tables in databases where it shouldn't. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods like `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied()`, and `applied_migrations()`. Additionally, we should look into the MigrationExecutor class and its methods dealing with applying and recording migrations. The ConnectionRouter class and its `allow_migrate` method should also be examined to understand how routing decisions are made.",

Specifically, the 'MigrationRecorder' should not create tables on databases other than the 'default' one when such a router is in place. To address this, we need to examine the relevant parts of the code where the 'MigrationRecorder' interacts with the database and check if it adheres to the router's rules. From the search results, we can see that the 'MigrationRecorder' class has methods that interact directly with the database, such as 'ensure_schema'. Additionally, the 'MigrationExecutor' class uses 'MigrationRecorder' and is responsible for applying migrations, which might bypass the router's rules if not handled correctly. Therefore, these sections of code are critical to review for ensuring that the database routing rules are respected.",

There is a Router class that decides whether migrations should be allowed on a given database.\n2. The MigrationRecorder should not create tables on databases other than 'default' according to the router.\n3. The MigrationExecutor calls the MigrationRecorder's methods like record_applied, which in turn calls ensure_schema, potentially creating tables on the wrong database.\n\nFrom the file context and search results, we can identify the following:\n- django/db/migrations/recorder.py contains the MigrationRecorder class, which has methods related to recording migrations.\n- django/db/migrations/executor.py contains the MigrationExecutor class, which uses the MigrationRecorder and calls its methods like record_applied.\n- django/db/utils.py contains the ConnectionRouter class, which implements the allow_migrate method.\n\nThese files and classes are directly relevant to the reported issue as they handle the recording and execution of migrations and the routing of database operations. The identified code spans show the interactions between these classes and how migrations are applied and recorded, which aligns with the issue description.

Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class shows how migrations are planned and applied, which would need to be adapted to consider the router's rules before proceeding with schema changes. However, while the file context provides a good starting point, it does not include detailed implementations of all the methods potentially involved in the process (e.g., `applied_migrations()`), and it lacks the direct integration of the `allow_migrate` check from the router. There's also a missing connection between the MigrationRecorder and the actual use of the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the MigrationRecorder in a multi-db setup with a custom database router. The issue states that when migrations are applied during test database creation, the MigrationRecorder incorrectly attempts to create the Migration model table on connections other than the 'default' one. This is despite the custom router explicitly prohibiting migrations on non-default databases. \n\nThe current file context and search results provide key insights into how Django handles migrations and the role of the MigrationRecorder. It's evident that the MigrationExecutor class uses the MigrationRecorder to apply and record migrations. The relevant methods to focus on include MigrationExecutor.apply_migration, MigrationExecutor.record_migration, and particularly MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema and MigrationRecorder.record_applied. These methods are crucial for understanding how the system checks for and records migrations.\n\nThe search results confirm the presence of these methods and their interactions. MigrationExecutor.apply_migration is responsible for applying migrations and uses MigrationExecutor.record_migration to record them. The MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema method, which checks for and creates the Migration model table, is invoked by MigrationExecutor.migrate. The code analysis reveals that these methods do not explicitly check the router's allow_migrate rules before proceeding with table creation and recording of migrations. This omission could be the root cause of the reported issue. \n\nTo address this issue, the code examining and modifying the database schema and migration records should incorporate checks on the router's allow_migrate method. If allow_migrate returns False for a specific database, no schema creation or migration recording should occur on that database. This modification would align with the custom router's intentions and prevent unwanted migrations on non-default databases.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans of code from django/db/migrations/executor.py are essential for understanding and potentially modifying to align with the router's allow_migrate rules. These spans are relevant as they directly touch upon the methods invoked during migration application, recording, and schema ensuring, which are central to the issue at hand.",

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
