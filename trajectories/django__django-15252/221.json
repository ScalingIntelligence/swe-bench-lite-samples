Specifically, the issue is that the MigrationRecorder attempts to create the django_migrations table in databases that should not have migration tables according to the custom router's allow_migrate rules. The custom router is confirmed to be properly implemented in the ConnectionRouter class, which checks the allow_migrate method of each router in the list and returns the decision. The focus now shifts to the MigrationRecorder class to identify where it disregards the router's rules and mistakenly creates the table. The relevant code spans in MigrationRecorder include the ensure_schema method, which directly attempts to create the table if it does not exist, and the record_applied method, which calls ensure_schema before recording that a migration has been applied. Additionally, the create_test_db method in BaseDatabaseCreation is relevant as it calls the migrate command, potentially triggering the issue during test database creation.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
