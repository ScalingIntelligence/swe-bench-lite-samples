The MigrationRecorder should adhere to the allow_migrate rules set by the router, but currently, it attempts to create tables in databases other than 'default'. The focus should be on the MigrationRecorder, the MigrationExecutor (especially the apply_migration method), and the database creation process during test setup. We should specifically look for the logic that checks for or creates the Migration table and ensure it respects the router's allow_migrate rules.",

The search results include several key components: 1. The MigrationRecorder class itself, particularly the methods ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied, which are crucial for managing the migration state. 2. The MigrationExecutor class, which uses MigrationRecorder and applies migrations, including the apply_migration method where the recorder's record_applied is called. 3. BaseDatabaseCreation class, which is responsible for creating test databases and running migrations during tests. These components are directly related to the behavior described in the issue. By analyzing these, I can confirm that the existing code indeed does not consider the DB router's allow_migrate rules when deciding whether to create the 'django_migrations' table. This aligns with the issue's description, indicating that the provided search results are relevant and complete for addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
