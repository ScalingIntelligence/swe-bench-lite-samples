To address this, we need to pinpoint where the MigrationRecorder attempts to create tables and ensure that it consults the database router. The relevant files identified in the context include django/db/migrations/recorder.py, which contains the MigrationRecorder class, and django/db/utils.py, which contains the ConnectionRouter class. Additionally, we need to check django/db/migrations/executor.py for the apply_migration method that uses the MigrationRecorder. We should also look into django/db/backends/creation.py for the database creation logic during tests.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around ensuring that the `MigrationRecorder` respects the `allow_migrate` rules of a custom database router in a multi-db setup. The current behavior of the `MigrationRecorder` leads to the creation of the `Migration` table on all connections, whereas it should only be created on the 'default' connection as per the router's rules. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the creation and recording of migrations and ensure they are adhering to the router's rules. Looking through the provided search results, we can see the following key areas of interest:\n\n1. **MigrationRecorder class and its methods** (span IDs: 'MigrationRecorder', 'MigrationRecorder.__init__', 'MigrationRecorder.migration_qs', 'MigrationRecorder.has_table', 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema', 'MigrationRecorder.applied_migrations', 'MigrationRecorder.record_applied'): These methods are central to the recording and schema management of migrations and are directly involved in the behavior described in the issue. Specifically, the `ensure_schema` method creates the migration table if it doesn't exist, which should respect the `allow_migrate` rules.\n\n2. **ConnectionRouter class and its methods** (span IDs: 'ConnectionRouter', 'ConnectionRouter.__init__', 'ConnectionRouter.routers', 'ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate'): The `ConnectionRouter` class and its methods are responsible for managing database routing and, more importantly, for respecting the custom router's rules. It is crucial that the `MigrationRecorder` consults the `ConnectionRouter`'s `allow_migrate` method to determine if the schema changes are allowed on a given database.\n\n3. **MigrationExecutor class and its methods** (span IDs: 'MigrationExecutor', 'MigrationExecutor.__init__', 'MigrationExecutor.migration_plan', 'MigrationExecutor.apply_migration', 'MigrationExecutor.record_migration'): This class handles the execution of migrations and leverages the `MigrationRecorder`. Ensuring that the `apply_migration` method respects the `allow_migrate` rules is critical to resolve the issue.\n\nGiven these areas of interest, it becomes clear that the `MigrationRecorder` and `MigrationExecutor` classes, along with the `ConnectionRouter`, are the primary code spans that need to be modified or checked to ensure compliance with the custom router's `allow_migrate` rules.",

The main concern is that the 'django_migrations' table is being created in databases other than 'default' when the db_router is configured to only allow migrations on the 'default' database. This includes potential issues with the ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_unapplied methods of the MigrationRecorder. The code analysis shows that the ensure_schema method directly handles the creation of the 'django_migrations' table if it does not exist, without any checks regarding the db_router's allow_migrate decision. This is a potential cause of the issue since the router's decision seems to be disregarded in this critical part of the code. The provided search results confirm that the ensure_schema method checks for the table's existence and tries to create it if it's not present. This aligns with the reported issue's description about unwanted table creation in non-default databases. Additionally, the relevance of this method to the reported issue is high as it directly affects how and where migrations are recorded and tables are created. Other methods like record_applied and record_unapplied are also implicated as they depend on ensure_schema, meaning they could face similar issues if not addressed.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
