From the code spans provided, the key areas are identified in django/db/migrations/recorder.py where the MigrationRecorder class is defined along with its methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations which interact directly with the database schema and migration records. These methods do not currently reference or respect any database router rules which is the core issue. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py defines the allow_migrate method, which is used to determine if a migration is allowed on a specific database. The BaseDatabaseCreation class in django/db/backends/base/creation.py also has a method create_test_db which calls migrate. It is important to ensure that during this process, the MigrationRecorder adheres to the allow_migrate rules set by the router. Since the current code does not check the allow_migrate rules within these critical methods of MigrationRecorder, identifying and modifying these specific spans of code in django/db/migrations/recorder.py is necessary to resolve the issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
