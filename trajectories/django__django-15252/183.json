Specifically, the issue points out that the `MigrationRecorder` does not respect the `allow_migrate` rules defined in the router and erroneously creates tables in databases other than the 'default' one. The primary focus in the provided search results is on the `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` file, which contains significant portions of the `MigrationRecorder` class, including methods such as `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied`, which are directly related to the schema creation and migration recording mechanisms that are key to the reported issue. Additionally, the `django/db/utils.py` file contains the `ConnectionRouter` class, which includes the `allow_migrate` method that the router uses to decide whether migrations should be allowed on a given database. Lastly, the `django/db/migrations/executor.py` file includes the `MigrationExecutor` class, which interacts with `MigrationRecorder` and plays a role in the migration application process. These file contexts are essential to understand why and how the schema might be created on the wrong database, and to modify the behavior accordingly. Therefore, these identified spans provide a solid foundation for a detailed review and potential fix relating to the problem described in the issue.",

Specifically, the MigrationRecorder class in django/db/migrations/recorder.py is central to the problem, as it contains the ensure_schema method that is responsible for creating the migration table. This method does not appear to check the db_router's allow_migrate rules before creating the table, which is the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/migrations allows us to see how the allow_migrate method is intended to be used. The MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py also shows how migrations are applied and recorded, linking back to the MigrationRecorder. Overall, the provided file context covers all the necessary components to understand and verify the issue. Further investigation may be needed to ensure all edge cases are covered, but at a fundamental level, the relevant code is identified.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
