This involves ensuring that tables are not created in non-'default' database connections when a router is in place.\n\nThe initial search results have yielded two key files: 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/utils.py'. The MigrationRecorder class in 'recorder.py' is central to this issue as it contains methods like 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and so on, which manage the creation and recording of migration tables. The 'recorder.py' section appears directly relevant as it contains the logic for schema creation and recording of migrations, which aligns with the reported issue of tables being created in non-'default' databases.\n\nThe 'utils.py' file, particularly the ConnectionHandler and ConnectionRouter classes, also seems relevant as they manage database connections and routing, and could potentially be involved in ensuring that database actions respect the router's rules.\n\nGiven these findings, it's clear that both 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/utils.py' are relevant to the reported issue. The identified spans in 'recorder.py' cover the core functionality that needs to be adjusted to respect the database router, while those in 'utils.py' provide context on how database connections and routing are handled globally.\n\nThis analysis suggests that the search for relevant code spans is complete as we have identified the parts of the codebase that directly address the reported issue.",

The MigrationRecorder class contains the ensure_schema and record_applied methods, which are central to the issue reported. Specifically, ensure_schema checks if the Migration model is in the tables of the connection and attempts to create the table if it does not exist. This behavior is directly related to the problem described in the issue, as it does not currently consult the allow_migrate rules from the database router. The ConnectionRouter class, which includes the allow_migrate method, suggests it should be consulted to determine if a migration should be allowed on a specific database. Given the current code in the file context, it appears that the relevant code for addressing the issue is identified, as it points to the need for modifying the MigrationRecorder to respect the allow_migrate rules from the router.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
