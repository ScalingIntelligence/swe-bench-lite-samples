The router's 'allow_migrate' method should prevent migrations from being applied to non-'default' databases, but the 'MigrationRecorder' class is not respecting this rule. This can be verified by investigating the 'MigrationRecorder', 'MigrationExecutor', and 'ConnectionRouter' classes, focusing on methods related to migration application and recording, such as 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'allow_migrate'. Additionally, the 'create_test_db' method in 'django/db/backends/creation.py' may be relevant, as it involves creating test databases where the issue might manifest.",

Specifically, the MigrationRecorder tries to create tables in databases that should not have tables created according to the router. The key areas to focus on are the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder and the apply_migration method in MigrationExecutor, as these are where the schema is ensured and migrations are applied, respectively. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method is relevant since it contains the logic for determining whether to allow migrations on a given database.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are:\n1. MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema - This method is responsible for ensuring the schema of the Migration model. It checks if the Migration model is in the tables and tries to create the table if it is not found.\n2. MigrationRecorder.record_applied - This method records that a migration has been applied and calls ensure_schema.\n3. MigrationExecutor.apply_migration - This method applies a migration and calls record_migration, which in turn calls record_applied on the MigrationRecorder.\n4. ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate - This method is used by the database router to determine if migrations are allowed on a specific database.\n\nThese spans contain the critical logic that interacts with the database and should be the focus for resolving the reported issue.",

Specifically, it highlights that the MigrationRecorder should respect the 'allow_migrate' rules defined in the database router. Currently, ensure_schema() method of MigrationRecorder does not check these rules before creating the migrations table. This leads to the table being created on all connections, not just 'default', which is against the expected behavior dictated by the router. To fix this, I propose introducing a check in ensure_schema() that adheres to the router's 'allow_migrate' rule.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
