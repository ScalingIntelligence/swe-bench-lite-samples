Specifically, the issue points out that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the allow_migrate rules defined in the router, leading to the creation of the django_migrations table in databases other than the 'default' one, which is not the expected behavior according to the router's rules.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are primarily found in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. The `MigrationRecorder` class, which is responsible for recording and ensuring the schema for migrations, contains methods such as `ensure_schema()`, `applied_migrations()`, `record_applied()`, and `record_unapplied()`. These methods directly interact with the database to record the application of migrations and ensure the necessary schema. However, these methods do not currently check or respect the `allow_migrate` rules from any defined router before performing these operations, which is likely the cause of the observed behavior.\n\nAdditionally, code related to `MigrationExecutor`, particularly the `apply_migration()` method, which interacts with `MigrationRecorder`, also does not appear to check the `allow_migrate` rules before recording the migration. This suggests that the core logic for handling migrations might need adjustments to integrate the router's rules appropriately.\n\nGiven these observations, the identified code spans are relevant as they directly touch on the logic around recording migrations and ensuring the migration schema, areas where integration of `allow_migrate` rules seems necessary based on the reported issue. Further, the code in `django/db/utils.py` concerning the `ConnectionRouter` class, particularly the `allow_migrate` method, demonstrates how the rules should ideally be applied but are not being respected in the migration execution and recording process.",

This class is responsible for recording applied migrations and ensuring the schema, which directly relates to the reported issue about the db_router's migration rules not being respected. The methods ensure_schema(), applied_migrations(), record_applied(), and record_unapplied() are all present and could potentially address or reveal issues related to the db_router rules not being followed. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class, which interacts with MigrationRecorder, is partially included in the context. While both the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor relevant parts are covered, the context does not include the specific integration points where the db_router's allow_migrate() method is invoked to enforce the routing rules during database operations. This missing context is crucial to determine if db_router rules are checked before making changes in the database.

The key points to address are how the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database and how it ensures the schema, records applied and unapplied migrations. From the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are primarily found in the django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py files. These files contain the methods and classes that manage migration recording and their application across databases. The issue seems to stem from the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder, which doesn't seem to check the db_router's allow_migrate rules before creating the migration table on non-default databases. This behavior can lead to tables being created where they shouldn't be based on the router's rules. The search results confirm this, as they show the methods of MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor that define how migrations are applied and recorded, including direct interactions with the database. Further, the django/db/utils.py file provides insights into the implementation of the ConnectionRouter and its allow_migrate method, indicating how it decides migration permissions for each database. The relevant code spans in the search results relate to the methods of recording migrations, interacting with the router, and applying migration rules, thus directly addressing the issue at hand.",

The issue points out that the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method creates the django_migrations table even on non-'default' databases, which goes against the expected behavior when a router is in place. To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the creation and management of the django_migrations table, as well as how the router's allow_migrate method is used or should be used to control this behavior. The initial file context and the search results provide several key code spans that are relevant to this issue. Specifically, I will focus on the spans related to MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied methods, as well as the use of router's allow_migrate method in ConnectionRouter. Additionally, I will look for any other methods or spans that could influence the creation of the django_migrations table across different databases.",

However, the actual integration with the db_router's allow_migrate method in the context of deciding schema changes is not explicitly shown. There is mention of 'self.connection.schema_editor()' and 'self.loader.applied_migrations', which suggest that the db_router should be consulted at those points to respect the allow_migrate rules. The ConnectionRouter class in 'django/db/utils.py' defines the allow_migrate method, which should be the point where the db_router's rules are applied. Based on this analysis, it seems that while the main components related to the issue are present, the explicit usage of the allow_migrate method within the migration application process (especially in the schema editing phase) is not detailed. This suggests that further investigation in the actual application of migrations respecting the db_router rules is needed.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
