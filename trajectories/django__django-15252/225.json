Specifically, the MigrationRecorder should not try to create tables on non-'default' connections when a db_router is in place. To investigate this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, especially ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations, as well as how these methods interact with the db_router's allow_migrate logic. Additionally, we should look at how the MigrationExecutor applies migrations and interacts with the MigrationRecorder. The ConnectionRouter and its allow_migrate method are also crucial since it determines which databases migrations are allowed to run on.",

The issue highlights that the MigrationRecorder should respect the allow_migrate rules defined in the router and not create tables on connections other than the 'default'. The key methods to focus on are ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied in the MigrationRecorder class. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class which invokes these methods should also be examined to ensure it aligns with the database router's rules. The search results include additional classes linked to database routing (ConnectionRouter) and test database creation (BaseDatabaseCreation, DatabaseCreation for different backends), which could also be relevant depending on how they interact with migrations and the database routers. Specifically, the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method should be checked for consistency with the reported issue. Overall, the provided context and search results seem sufficient to address the reported issue regarding migration handling and database routing in Django.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
