The problem occurs during the execution of the 'migrate' command, specifically when the MigrationRecorder tries to create a table in a non-'default' database connection when it should not. To address this, we need to focus our search on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, especially `record_applied`, `ensure_schema`, and `applied_migrations`. Additionally, we should examine the methods in the ConnectionRouter class, particularly those related to migration permissions such as `allow_migrate` and `allow_migrate_model`. We should also inspect the MigrationExecutor class and its methods that interact with the MigrationRecorder, such as `apply_migration`, `record_migration`, and `unapply_migration`. Finally, we need to check the BaseDatabaseCreation and its subclasses for any code that interacts with these components during the test database creation process.",

Specifically, the issue points out that the MigrationRecorder attempts to create the django_migrations table on all connections, not just the 'default' connection as defined by the router. This behavior is observed when running functional tests that create test databases and apply migrations. The relevant parts of the codebase seem to be in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/utils.py, and django/db/migrations/executor.py. In django/db/migrations/recorder.py, the MigrationRecorder class has methods that ensure the schema and record migrations, which are central to the issue. The MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema method checks if the migration table exists and creates it if it does not, which should ideally respect the db router's rules. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py is responsible for routing database operations and includes methods like allow_migrate that should be consulted to decide whether to apply migrations on a given database. The MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py uses the MigrationRecorder and is involved in executing migrations, including recording which migrations have been applied. It seems that the current implementation might bypass or incorrectly handle the db router's allow_migrate method, leading to the creation of the migration table on non-'default' databases. Further inspection of how these components interact during the migration process is necessary to fully address the issue.",

The MigrationRecorder class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' contains methods like 'record_applied', 'ensure_schema', and 'applied_migrations', all of which are directly involved in the process of recording applied migrations and ensuring the schema is up-to-date. This class also interacts with the database connection, which is crucial for understanding how the migration rules are applied and possibly where the issue of migrating to the incorrect database arises. However, while the MigrationRecorder is thoroughly explored, there's a gap in the immediate context on how the ConnectionRouter's 'allow_migrate' method exactly interacts with the migration executor and recorder. Further, the executor's method 'apply_migration' and 'record_migration' do involve recording migrations but lack the immediate oversight of the router's permission checks at the point of actual application and record creation. Given the complexity and the nature of the reported issue, which spans across multiple databases and their respective routers, there's a possibility that the immediate file context might not encapsulate all crucial interactions with the database routers. Nevertheless, the core components and methods necessary for addressing the issue are present in the context, indicating a solid base but leaving room for an in-depth analysis of router interactions during the migration process.",

This is crucial in a multi-db setup where it's expected that tables are only created in the 'default' connection and never in other connections. The issue points to specific methods and functions within the Django codebase that could be causing this behavior, including MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations methods, as well as the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter. The provided file context and search results include these methods and classes, confirming that the relevant parts of the codebase have been located.\n\nAfter reviewing the <file_context>, which includes the MigrationRecorder and ConnectionRouter implementations, and comparing these with the <search_results>, it's apparent that the relevant code spans are well represented. The search results revisit the MigrationExecutor, ConnectionRouter, and BaseDatabaseCreation classes, among others, but these reappear to provide deeper context and additional relevant methods rather than suggesting new, unconsidered code.\n\nThe identified code spans cover the key concerns outlined in the reported issue, including the logic for ensuring schema, recording applied migrations, and the implementation of the allow_migrate method used to dictate which databases are eligible for migrations. Thus, it is concluded that the search for relevant code based on the reported issue is complete, as all pertinent parts of the code have been identified and are represented within the provided search results and file context.",

The MigrationExecutor class uses these tools to apply migrations, and its methods like `apply_migration`, `record_migration`, and `migrate` show how migrations are processed based on the database router's decisions in 'utils.py'. However, there seems to be a gap in directly showing how the router decisions are always respected during schema creation or modification by the MigrationRecorder.

The current behavior is that the table for MigrationRecorder is created on connections other than 'default', which is not expected when a router is provided. The relevant parts of the code are found in the MigrationRecorder class and the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter class. Notably, the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder does not check the allow_migrate rule before creating the table. The search results include the record_unapplied method in MigrationRecorder that could have similar issues with respecting the router rules. It's crucial to ensure that all methods interacting with the db consider the router's rules to maintain the expected behavior in a multi-db setup. The solution would involve adding checks for allow_migrate before performing actions like creating tables or recording migrations, ensuring that these actions are only performed on connections where they are allowed according to the router's rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
