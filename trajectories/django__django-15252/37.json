The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder attempts to create the Migration model table on databases other than the 'default' one, which contradicts the router's rules. This behavior is observed when running functional tests, where the migrate command is executed against each connection. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and related functions such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations. Additionally, the code related to the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration and record_migration methods should be examined for potential issues in handling migrations according to the router's rules. Finally, the setup_databases function in django/test/runner.py and create_test_db in django/db/backends/creation.py need to be checked for how they handle and execute migrations across different database connections.",

The core concern is that the MigrationRecorder is not respecting the db_router's allow_migrate rules, leading to the creation of the Migration model table in databases that should not have it. The relevant code spans to address this issue can be found in three files: django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/migrations/executor.py, and django/db/backends/base/creation.py. In django/db/migrations/recorder.py, the ensure_schema method is where the table creation logic resides, which needs to be checked against the router's allow_migrate rules. In django/db/migrations/executor.py, both the apply_migration and record_migration methods are of interest, as they directly involve interacting with the MigrationRecorder and thus need to be aligned with the router's rules. The create_test_db method in django/db/backends/base/creation.py is also relevant, as it outlines how test databases are set up with migrations, and ensuring this process respects the router is essential.",

However, the current behavior attempts to create the Migration model table on all connections when running tests, which is incorrect. Key files and methods involved in this process include executor.py and recorder.py. In the executor.py file, the MigrationExecutor class is responsible for applying migrations, and it uses the MigrationRecorder to record the applied migrations. The relevant method here is apply_migration, which calls record_migration. In recorder.py, the ensure_schema method is the main focus, as it checks if the Migration model table exists and tries to create it if it doesn't. This method does not check the allow_migrate rules from the router, leading to the issue.

Specifically, the concern is that the MigrationRecorder should not create tables in databases other than the 'default' one when a router is in place to restrict migrations. From the provided context and search results, we can see that the MigrationRecorder has a method `ensure_schema` which checks if the Migration model table exists in the current connection. If not, it attempts to create the table. This method does not currently check the `allow_migrate` rule of the router, which could lead to tables being created in non-'default' databases. This aligns with the issue described. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class has methods `apply_migration` and `record_migration` that interact with the `MigrationRecorder`, and these also do not seem to explicitly check the router's allow_migrate rule before recording migrations. This could be where the problem arises, as the migrations are being recorded and potentially applied to databases where they should not be according to the router's rules. The `BaseDatabaseCreation` class, which is responsible for creating test databases, also calls the migrate command without explicit checks for the router's allow_migrate rule. Overall, the identified code spans confirm that there is no explicit enforcement of the router's allow_migrate rule in the critical parts of the migration process, which could lead to the undesired behavior described in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
