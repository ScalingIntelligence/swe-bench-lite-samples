To address this issue, it is crucial to identify the relevant code spans where the decision to create a table (using the ensure_schema method) and record migrations (using record_applied) is made. The review of the search results shows that the methods ensure_schema and record_applied both in the MigrationRecorder class and the apply_migration method in the MigrationExecutor class are central to this issue. These methods directly involve schema creation and recording of migrations, which are critical steps influenced by the router configuration. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

Specifically, the issue is that the 'django_migrations' table is being created on databases other than the 'default' one, which conflicts with the router's rules. To address this, it's crucial to identify and understand all methods in the MigrationRecorder class that interact with the database schema or record migration status. The provided search results and current context contain key methods such as 'ensure_schema', 'has_table', 'record_applied', 'record_unapplied', and 'applied_migrations'. These methods are critical because they directly involve checking if the 'django_migrations' table exists, ensuring its schema, and recording the application of migrations. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods 'apply_migration' and '_create_project_state' are relevant as they interact with the MigrationRecorder, potentially triggering its methods in the process. These sections of code are directly related to the issue described and will be essential for diagnosing and potentially fixing the problem.",

These spans include methods like ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied in the MigrationRecorder class, as well as methods in the MigrationExecutor class related to migration application and recording. The code spans highlight the interactions between these methods and the database, which are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue. It's evident from the ensure_schema method that it attempts to create the django_migrations table without checking the allow_migrate rule, which is the core issue described. Similarly, methods like record_applied and record_unapplied also call ensure_schema, implicating them in the problem. The MigrationExecutor's methods like apply_migration and migrate further illustrate how migrations are applied and recorded, showing the flow of control and data that could be contributing to the issue.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
