The expectation is that tables related to migrations should only be created in the 'default' database connection, as specified by the router. However, the current behavior is that tables are being created in other connections as well, which is incorrect. To address this, we need to pinpoint the exact locations in the Django codebase where the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database to ensure schema and record migrations. The key methods involved are likely `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `applied_migrations` in the MigrationRecorder, and potentially the `apply_migration` method in the MigrationExecutor. We also need to review the database router logic in the `allow_migrate` method to ensure it is being respected.",

Specifically, the user is concerned that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's allow_migrate rules, potentially leading to tables being created on non-default databases. The key aspects to focus on from the issue description include the Router class implementation, the migrations execution process, and the functions related to recording applied and unapplied migrations. The search results provide insights into how Django handles migrations and how the MigrationRecorder ensures the schema of the migration tables. The MigrationRecorder class's methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied are crucial as they manage the creation and recording of migration states. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class's methods, especially those involved in applying and recording migrations, are relevant to the issue. The MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method, in particular, checks for the presence of the migration table and creates it if absent, which is central to the reported issue. Therefore, these methods should be examined closely to determine if they properly adhere to the database router's directives.",

The key focus is to ensure that the Migration model table is not created on connections other than 'default'. From the file context, we see methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied in the MigrationRecorder class that directly interact with the database schema. These methods do not seem to check db_router rules before creating or modifying the schema, which could lead to the incorrect behavior described in the issue. The search_results provided includes additional relevant code spans. Notably, in django/db/utils.py, the ConnectionRouter class has methods like allow_migrate and allow_migrate_model that should be consulted when deciding whether to allow schema changes on a given database. In django/db/migrations/loader.py, the MigrationLoader class is shown, which interacts with migrations and could be responsible for ensuring router rules are respected during the loading process. Finally, in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method is shown again, reinforcing the need to integrate router checks in this method to address the issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
