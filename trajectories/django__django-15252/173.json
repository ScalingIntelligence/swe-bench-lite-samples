The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder is not respecting the db_router's allow_migrate rules, leading to the creation of the 'django_migrations' table in databases other than the 'default' one. The search results provided contain the relevant code for the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes, which handle the recording of applied migrations and the execution of migration plans, respectively. The key methods to focus on are: MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema, which checks for the existence of the 'django_migrations' table and creates it if it doesn't exist; MigrationRecorder.record_applied and record_unapplied, which record whether a migration has been applied or unapplied; and MigrationExecutor.apply_migration and unapply_migration, which apply or unapply a migration and call the recorder methods to record their actions. These methods currently do not take into account the db_router's allow_migrate rules when deciding where to create or update the 'django_migrations' table. The analysis of these methods indicates that they directly interact with the database based on the current connection without considering the routing rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
