The expectation is that tables related to migrations (like the 'Migration' table) should not be created on databases other than the 'default' one, as configured by the router. Several key methods and classes are involved, including allow_migrate in the router, methods in MigrationRecorder, and the migrate command's interaction with these. I'll focus on finding the relevant segments of the codebase that handle the interaction between the db_router's allow_migrate and MigrationRecorder's schema handling to ensure all relevant code is checked for the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the behavior of the MigrationRecorder class in Django's migration system when dealing with a multi-db setup and a custom database router. The primary concern is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the allow_migrate rules defined in the router, leading to the creation of the django_migrations table in databases other than the 'default' one. This issue is critical as it bypasses the intended routing mechanism and can cause undesired table creations in databases that should not be modified.\n\nStep 1: Analyzing the reported issue, it's clear that the focus is on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods such as ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied. These methods interact directly with the database and should adhere to the routing rules defined by the user.\n\nStep 2: Reviewing the current file context, there are no previously identified files or code spans, indicating that this is the initial analysis.\n\nStep 3: Processing the new search results, we find that the relevant code spans are primarily within the `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` file, specifically within the `MigrationRecorder` class. The methods `ensure_schema`, `applied_migrations`, and `record_applied` are of particular interest as they handle schema checks and modifications.\n\n3.1 Examining each code span, it's evident that the current implementation of `MigrationRecorder` does not check the router's allow_migrate rules before performing database operations. This omission is what leads to the unintended behavior described in the issue.\n\n3.2 No other files or code sections in the search results appear to directly address the issue at hand. Therefore, the focus remains on the `MigrationRecorder` class.\n\nStep 4: Using the Identify function to respond with the relevant code spans, specifically those within the `MigrationRecorder` class that need to be revised to align with the database router's allow_migrate rules.",

The analysis has focused on the MigrationRecorder class within django/db/migrations/recorder.py and the MigrationExecutor class within django/db/migrations/executor.py. Key methods under scrutiny include ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied in MigrationRecorder, and apply_migration in MigrationExecutor, where calls to recorder methods occur. The concern is that ensure_schema does not respect the db_router settings, leading to the creation of the django_migrations table on unintended databases.

The specific concern is that the Migration model's table is being created on databases other than the 'default' one, despite the use of a router that should restrict this. The relevant code spans provided include the MigrationRecorder class and its methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied. These methods are responsible for ensuring the schema, recording applied migrations, and recording unapplied migrations, respectively. The issue seems to arise because the MigrationRecorder does not check the allow_migrate rule before creating or recording migrations. The new search results provided also show the MigrationExecutor class and its methods, which interact with the MigrationRecorder, showcasing the flow of migration execution and recording. This confirms that the MigrationRecorder's behavior directly impacts the migration process across databases, highlighting the need for a check against the db_router's allow_migrate method. Additionally, the BaseDatabaseCreation class and its create_test_db method are relevant as they orchestrate the creation of test databases and the execution of migrations during tests, which could trigger the issue in a test environment. This analysis indicates that the provided code spans are all relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
