The MigrationRecorder should respect the router's `allow_migrate` rules and not create tables on connections other than the 'default'. Relevant code spans include the MigrationRecorder methods like `ensure_schema`, as well as the MigrationExecutor methods dealing with applying and recording migrations. The ConnectionRouter's `allow_migrate` method and possibly the `create_test_db` method in `django/db/backends/creation.py` are also critical for understanding the test database creation process.",

            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue, we need to focus on the parts of the codebase that deal with migration recording and application across multiple databases. The issue specifically points out that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules. From the search results, we can identify several key areas that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. In `MigrationRecorder`, the `ensure_schema` method is responsible for checking if the migration table exists and creating it if it does not. This method does not seem to consult the db_router's allow_migrate rules before creating the table. This is a critical point where the behavior does not align with the user's expectations.\n\n2. The `MigrationExecutor` class interacts closely with `MigrationRecorder`. It contains methods like `migrate`, `apply_migration`, and `record_migration` that are integral to the migration process. Specifically, `apply_migration` calls `self.recorder.record_applied`, which in turn calls `ensure_schema`.\n\n3. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` is responsible for routing decisions including `allow_migrate`. This class is where the logic for which databases migrations should be allowed to apply resides. This context is essential for understanding how routing is supposed to work.\n\n4. From `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`, `BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db` method shows how test databases are created and migrated, which is relevant for the functional tests issue mentioned.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the role of the `db_router` in determining which migrations should be applied to which databases, the identified spans directly relate to how migrations are recorded and schema ensured in a multi-db setup. The main problem appears to be in the `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema` where the method does not consult the `db_router` to ensure the schema in databases that are allowed according to the router's rules. The other relevant code snipperts support the overall understanding of where, in the codebase, this oversight occurs and the broader context in which routing and migration interact.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
