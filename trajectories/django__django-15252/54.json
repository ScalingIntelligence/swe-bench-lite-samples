The user's expectation is that the django_migrations table should only be created in the 'default' database and not in any other databases. The provided search results show key parts of the code related to the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes that handle migration recording and application.\n\nFrom the code spans, it is clear that the MigrationRecorder class contains methods such as ensure_schema and record_applied, which are crucial for creating the migration table and recording the application of migrations. However, there is no apparent direct check for the db_router rules within these methods. In the context of applying migrations, the MigrationExecutor class uses the MigrationRecorder to record the migration status, but again, there is no explicit check to see if the current database matches the 'default' one according to the router. This omission could lead to the creation of the migration table in databases where it should not be created, as per the user's reported issue.\n\nThe analysis suggests that the relevant code spans to address this issue are those located in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, specifically the ensure_schema and record_applied methods of the MigrationRecorder class, and additionally, the record_migration method in django/db/migrations/executor.py, as it also interacts directly with the MigrationRecorder. These spans need to be adapted to incorporate the db_router checks to ensure the migrations table is only created where allowed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans crucially need to integrate checks based on the db_router's allow_migrate rules to resolve the issue correctly.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
