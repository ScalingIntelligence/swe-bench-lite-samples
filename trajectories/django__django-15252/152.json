Specifically, it is noted that the ensure_schema method in the MigrationRecorder class attempts to create the django_migrations table without respecting the router's decision, leading to the table being created in databases other than the 'default'. This behavior is unexpected and can disrupt a multi-db setup where certain databases should not have tables created for Django's migration tracking. Additionally, the issue mentions potential similar problems with applied_migrations and record_unapplied methods, though the detailed review is focused on ensure_schema.\n\nThe provided search results and file contexts support this analysis. The django/db/migrations/recorder.py file shows the implementation of the MigrationRecorder class with methods that could influence table creation on non-'default' databases. The ensure_schema method directly influences this by checking if the table exists and, if not, attempting to create it without considering the db_router's allow_migrate decision. The record_applied and record_unapplied methods also interact with ensure_schema, suggesting they might need similar routing checks. Since the issue is concerned with the table creation aspect, the relevant code spans are primarily those involved in schema operations within MigrationRecorder.",

The `apply_migration` method in `MigrationExecutor` directly interacts with `MigrationRecorder` through the `record_migration` call, which indicates a potential spot where the db_router's `allow_migrate` rules might need to be checked. Additionally, the `ensure_schema` method in `MigrationRecorder` is where the creation of the migration table is attempted, which should ideally consult the db_router's rules. The context suggests that these methods are critical for understanding how migrations are applied and recorded across different databases.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
