This is causing tables to be created in databases where they shouldn't, specifically in non-'default' databases. To address this, I need to focus on searching for the relevant sections of the code where the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database and how it determines whether to create tables. I should also look into how the db_router settings are integrated and whether there are checks missing or insufficient. The relevant files and methods to investigate are primarily in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/utils.py`, focusing on methods like `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, `allow_migrate`, and the overall interaction between the MigrationRecorder and the ConnectionRouter.",

This leads to the creation of migration tables in databases other than the 'default' one, which is against the expected behavior. \n\nFrom the search results, several key areas are identified that are directly related to the problem: \n1. The `MigrationRecorder` class in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` contains methods `ensure_schema` and `record_applied`, which are critical as they ensure the migration table exists and records the applied migrations. \n2. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` contains the `allow_migrate` method, which should dictate which databases allow migrations. \n3. The `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` interacts with the `MigrationRecorder` to apply and record migrations. \n\nBased on the issue description, the problematic behavior seems to originate from the `ensure_schema` method in `MigrationRecorder`, which should ideally respect the `allow_migrate` rule from the router before attempting to create the schema. \n\nThese findings suggest that the current implementation of `ensure_schema` does not check the router's allow_migrate rules, leading to the creation of tables in non-default databases. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are within `MigrationRecorder` and `MigrationExecutor`.",

The provided file context and search results give insight into how the MigrationExecutor and MigrationRecorder classes work.\n\nIn the file context, the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method checks if the django_migrations table exists and creates it if it doesn't. This method does not currently check the db_router's allow_migrate rules.\n\nIn the search results, the ConnectionRouter class contains the allow_migrate method that checks if a migration is allowed for a specific database. This method should be consulted before creating the django_migrations table.\n\nBased on the issue and the relevant parts of the code, it is clear that the MigrationRecorder should check the db_router's allow_migrate rules in its ensure_schema method before attempting to create the table.

The provided code snippets highlight two key areas of concern: the `ensure_schema` method in `MigrationRecorder` and the `apply_migration` method in `MigrationExecutor`. These methods currently do not explicitly check the `allow_migrate` rules before performing actions that affect the database schema. This indicates a possible oversight that could be causing the issue where tables are being created in the wrong databases. To address this, additional search requests should be made to look into the broader context of how `allow_migrate` rules are handled elsewhere in the Django migration system, particularly in methods like `_create_project_state` in `MigrationExecutor`. Also, the calling context in `django/test/runner.py` and `django/db/backends/creation.py` should be examined to determine if these rules should be integrated at those points as well. This will help identify any standard practices where these rules are consulted that might be missing in the current methods under scrutiny.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the MigrationRecorder in a multi-db setup when a db_router is applied. The expectation is that the Django migrations should respect the router's allow_migrate rules, but it appears that the MigrationRecorder is creating tables in non-default databases. This misbehavior can be traced to the ensure_schema method in the MigrationRecorder class, which checks if the Migration model table exists in the current connection and creates it if it doesn't. No check against the db_router's allow_migrate rule is made at this point.\n\nReviewing the provided code spans, it's clear that the MigrationRecorder does not consult the db_router's allow_migrate method when deciding whether to create the django_migrations table. This omission is fundamental to the issue at hand. The relevant code spans are those where ensure_schema is defined in the MigrationRecorder class, and the init and apply_migration methods in the MigrationExecutor, as they interact with or call ensure_schema.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder should be updated to consult the db_router's allow_migrate method prior to creating the table. Similarly, the record_applied and other methods that interact with the database should also be checked to ensure they respect the db_router's rules.\n\nThus, the identified relevant code spans are:\n- MigrationRecorder class in django/db/migrations/recorder.py\n  - ensure_schema method\n  - record_applied method\n- MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py\n  - __init__ method\n  - apply_migration method",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
