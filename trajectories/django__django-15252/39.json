Given the issue's focus on 'MigrationRecorder' methods like 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied', the search results from 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' directly align with this. Each method described in the issue can be found in the provided code spans, including 'has_table', 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied'. This shows that the search results contain the relevant functionality for addressing the reported issue. Additionally, the 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' file contains related methods like 'apply_migration' and 'migrate' that utilize 'MigrationRecorder', further supporting the relevance of these search results to the issue. Examining these methods in detail, such as 'ensure_schema' calling 'has_table' to check for the 'django_migrations' table and conditionally creating it, confirms that the provided search results are indeed relevant to the issue. The functionality to record migrations and ensure schema aligns perfectly with the expectations based on the reported issue, so these results should be sufficient to address the issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
