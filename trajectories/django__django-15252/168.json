Specifically, it appears that the MigrationRecorder does not properly respect the allow_migrate rules defined in the router, leading to tables being created in non-'default' databases. To address this, we need to locate the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the migration recording and application, as well as the logic for respecting database routers. We should focus on the MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and possibly the ConnectionRouter classes, as well as any related methods or functions.",

This is a critical issue in a multi-db setup, where tables should only be created in the 'default' database connection, not in other connections. The main functions of interest are the ensure_schema, record_applied, and apply_migration methods in the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes. These functions interact directly with the database schema and migrations, potentially bypassing the db_router rules. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method is relevant as it determines whether migrations are allowed on a specific database. \n\nGiven the search results, the following code spans are relevant:\n\n1. django/db/migrations/recorder.py\n   - MigrationRecorder (class definition)\n   - MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema (method handling schema creation)\n   - MigrationRecorder.record_applied (method for recording applied migrations)\n\n2. django/db/migrations/executor.py\n   - MigrationExecutor (class definition)\n   - MigrationExecutor.__init__ (initialization handling the database connection)\n   - MigrationExecutor.apply_migration (method applying the migrations)\n\n3. django/db/utils.py\n   - ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate (method verifying if migrations are allowed based on the router rules)\n\nThese spans are crucial for understanding how the migration process and database schema creation are handled, and identifying where the db_router rules might be overridden or ignored. This analysis should help in diagnosing and fixing the issue where tables are created outside the 'default' database.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
