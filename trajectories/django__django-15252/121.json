This suggests a deeper investigation into the MigrationRecorder class, the MigrationExecutor class, and potentially the ConnectionRouter class for how they handle and respect the db_router's directives.",

Specifically, the user expects that the Migration model table should not be created on any connection other than the 'default' connection when a router is present. This poses the challenge of identifying the relevant sections of the Django codebase that might be directly or indirectly related to this issue.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the most pertinent sections are found in the `django/db/migrations/executor.py` and `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` files. The `MigrationExecutor` class in executor.py uses `MigrationRecorder` to record when a migration has been applied, and this operation directly involves checking or creating the schema via the `ensure_schema` method in recorder.py. These methods form the crux of the issue as they handle the actions that the user believes should respect the `allow_migrate` rules of the router.\n\nThe other file, `django/db/utils.py`, contains the `ConnectionRouter` class which defines the `allow_migrate` method. Although this method is part of the router functionality, it directly doesn't handle schema creation, which is why it's given less weight than the spans in executor.py and recorder.py for the current analysis.\n\nTherefore, the identified spans in executor.py and recorder.py are crucial for addressing the core of the reported issue, while the span in utils.py provides context on how routers are meant to handle migration permissions.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
