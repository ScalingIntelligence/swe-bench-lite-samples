According to the custom router provided, migrations should only be applied to the 'default' database, yet the MigrationRecorder incorrectly tries to create a table in non-default databases, violating the router's rules. To address this, we need to focus on the areas of Django's codebase that are responsible for recording migration applications and ensuring schema compliance, particularly the MigrationRecorder class and its methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations. We also need to check the MigrationExecutor class and its apply_migration method, which interacts closely with the MigrationRecorder. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method play a critical role in determining which databases should receive migrations.",

The key concern is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's allow_migrate rules, potentially creating tables in databases where it should not. This issue is evident in the methods ensure_schema and record_applied in the MigrationRecorder class. The ensure_schema method checks for the existence of the Migration model's table and attempts to create it if absent, without consulting the database router. Similarly, the record_applied method directly calls ensure_schema and records the applied migrations, bypassing the router's rules. In contrast, the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter class is designed to check with registered routers before allowing a migration. This suggests an inconsistency in how the MigrationRecorder and the ConnectionRouter interact with the database rules. To address this, the relevant code spans are identified from django/db/migrations/recorder.py (span ids 'MigrationRecorder.__init__', 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema', and 'MigrationRecorder.record_applied'). Additionally, to understand how migrations are applied and recorded, the spans from django/db/migrations/executor.py ('MigrationExecutor.__init__' and 'MigrationExecutor.apply_migration') are also relevant.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the behavior of Django's MigrationRecorder in a multi-db setup where a custom database router is used to control which databases can have migrations applied. The core problem is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's 'allow_migrate' rules and tries to create migration tables on all connections, not just the 'default' one as specified by the router.\n\nThe current file context provides critical insights into where the issue lies. In 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', the MigrationRecorder class contains methods such as 'ensure_schema' and 'record_applied', which are directly involved in creating migration tables and recording migration history. Given the description, it is evident that the 'ensure_schema' method does not check the 'allow_migrate' rules before attempting to create a table, which is the crux of the issue.\n\nIn 'django/db/migrations/executor.py', the MigrationExecutor class is also relevant, as it initializes the MigrationRecorder and calls its methods during the migration process. This context highlights how the MigrationRecorder is integrated into Django's migration system and why its multi-db behavior is essential.\n\nThe new search results from 'django/db/utils.py' introduce the ConnectionRouter class, which is responsible for implementing the 'allow_migrate' logic across all configured routers. This further reinforces the need for the MigrationRecorder to consult these rules during its operations.\n\nTo resolve the reported issue, it is clear that the MigrationRecorder needs to be modified to check with the ConnectionRouter or similar before taking action on migrations. Specific methods such as 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and potentially others, should incorporate logic to respect the 'allow_migrate' rules provided by the router system.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the identified code spans can guide the necessary changes to follow the 'allow_migrate' rules in future implementations or modifications.",

The issue points out that even when a router is in place, the MigrationRecorder tries to create tables in non-default databases, which is not the expected behavior. The relevant code spans provided in the search results are from django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py. These files are crucial because they manage the recording and application of migrations. I've identified specific spans within these files that are directly linked to the issue at hand. For instance, in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, the `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, and `applied_migrations` methods are relevant as they deal with the creation and management of the migration tables. In django/db/migrations/executor.py, the `apply_migration`, `record_migration`, and `migrate` methods are relevant as they interact with the MigrationRecorder and are part of the migration application process. These spans are closely related to the reported issue as they contain the logic that appears to be ignoring the db_router rules.",

The apply_migration method in MigrationExecutor is where the migration is actually applied to the database, and it records the migration using the MigrationRecorder. This process also does not currently check with the database router to ensure it should be applied to the current database. Given this, it seems the primary area of focus should be enhancing these methods and potentially others within the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes to integrate with the allow_migrate method in the database router, ensuring that the migrations and schema creation respect the database router's rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
