The problem is most likely in the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder class. Additionally, the behavior might also affect the applied_migrations and record_unapplied methods. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and the methods that interact with the database schema and record applications of migrations. We should also consider the ConnectionRouter class as it handles the routing logic for database operations. The search should focus on exact code snippets and function names to ensure we target the correct parts of the codebase.",

The user expects that the MigrationRecorder should respect the router's allow_migrate rules and not create tables in non-default databases. The current behavior is that the MigrationRecorder tries to create the django_migrations table in all databases, regardless of the router's rules. This is evident from the ensure_schema method in the MigrationRecorder class, which checks if the table exists and, if not, attempts to create it. This behavior appears to be incorrect according to the user's expectations. The relevant code spans are those that deal with the creation and management of the django_migrations table in the recorder.py file, specifically within the MigrationRecorder class. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class in utils.py, which handles the allow_migrate logic, is relevant for understanding how the router should influence migration behavior.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
