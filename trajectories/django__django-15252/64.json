This leads to tables being created in databases where they shouldn't be based on the routing logic. To address this, I need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, especially those related to schema creation and recording applied migrations. Additionally, I should look into the MigrationExecutor class where the migrations are applied, and ensure that the router's rules are being obeyed during this process. The issue mentions specific methods and files, so I will primarily concentrate on django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py, as well as the relevant methods within these files.",

The key parts to focus on are the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly ensure_schema and record_applied, which are responsible for creating the django_migrations table and recording applied migrations. The issue is that these methods do not check the db_router's allow_migrate rules before performing actions on the database. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class, which uses the MigrationRecorder, needs to be examined to ensure it respects the router's rules when applying migrations. The solution involves ensuring that any database operation, especially creating tables or recording migrations, is first validated against the db_router's rules. The provided search results contain relevant code spans that need to be modified to integrate these checks.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
