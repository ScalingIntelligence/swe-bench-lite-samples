The issue highlights the need to prevent the creation of the Migration model table on databases other than the 'default' connection when a router is in use. To address this, I analyzed the provided search results and identified several key sections of code that are directly related to the migration process and the enforcement of database-specific rules. The code in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' handles the application of migrations, including recording applied migrations. The 'MigrationExecutor.apply_migration' method is particularly relevant as it involves the actual application of migrations and the recording of these actions. Additionally, the 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema' method in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' determines whether the Migration table exists and creates it if it does not, which might lead to the incorrect behavior described in the issue if not properly routed. Lastly, the 'ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate' method in 'django/db/utils.py' is responsible for deciding whether a particular migration is allowed, which is central to solving the issue. These sections of code are critical for understanding and correcting the behavior of migrations with respect to database routers.",

These are involved in applying migrations, recording migration status, and determining database routing, respectively.

The ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method is responsible for enforcing the routing rules. The identified spans show how migrations are applied and recorded, and how the router is involved in deciding database access for migrations.

The issue describes that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the allow_migrate rules defined in a custom router, leading to the creation of the django_migrations table in non-'default' databases. This is against the expectation that tables should only be created in the 'default' database as specified by the router.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified in the search results are primarily located in the django/db/migrations/executor.py and django/db/migrations/recorder.py files. These files contain the MigrationExecutor and MigrationRecorder classes, respectively. The key methods to focus on for resolving this issue are MigrationExecutor.apply_migration, which calls record_migration, and MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema, which checks if the Migration model is in the tables of the connection and attempts to create the table if not found. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate method in django/db/utils.py must be considered since it determines the allowed databases for migrations.\n\nConsidering the entire context and understanding the issue's requirements, we need to ensure that the MigrationRecorder respects the allow_migrate rules when attempting to create the django_migrations table and record applied migrations. By examining the provided code spans, we can conclude that the search results are relevant and sufficient to address the reported issue, as they cover all critical parts of the migration process that need adjustment to make the MigrationRecorder respect the database routers.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
