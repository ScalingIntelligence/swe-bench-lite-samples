The problem arises when the MigrationRecorder tries to ensure the schema in databases other than the 'default' one, which should be prohibited by the router. To address this, we need to examine the MigrationRecorder class and its methods like ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied. Additionally, we should review the MigrationExecutor to understand how migrations are applied and recorded. The ConnectionRouter class is also crucial to ensure that the router logic is correctly implemented and followed.",

The key elements to focus on are the MigrationRecorder class, especially its ensure_schema and record_applied methods, and the MigrationExecutor class's interaction with MigrationRecorder. The search results reveal the relevant code spans that are directly related to these behaviors:\n\n1. In `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, the `MigrationRecorder` class is defined with methods `ensure_schema` and `record_applied`. The `ensure_schema` method checks if the Migration model table exists and tries to create it if it does not. This behavior is central to the reported issue as it does not respect the db_router rules for which database should be altered.\n\n2. Also in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, the `record_applied` method calls `ensure_schema` before recording that a migration has been applied. This supports the understanding that the schema creation is a precursor to recording migrations, which should not occur on databases other than 'default' as per the router.\n\n3. In `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class initializes a `MigrationRecorder` instance and calls `apply_migration`, which involves recording migrations. This chain of interactions is critical to understanding how the migration recording process might bypass the db_router's intentions.\n\nThese identified spans of code are directly relevant to the reported issue because they show where and how the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database schema and migration records, which should be controlled by the db_router but currently are not.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
