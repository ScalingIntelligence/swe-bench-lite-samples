The primary concern is that the MigrationRecorder should not create tables in databases other than the 'default' one, as dictated by the router. The search should focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_unapplied. Additionally, it's important to check the interactions of these methods with the db_router and the migration executor.",

Specifically, the user's custom router allows migrations only on the 'default' database and not on other databases. The current behavior of the MigrationRecorder class, however, results in the creation of the django_migrations table on all databases during the migration process, which contradicts the router's rules. From the search results, it is clear that the MigrationRecorder class contains methods like ensure_schema() and record_applied() which are responsible for creating and maintaining the django_migrations table. These methods do not currently check with the database router to determine if it's allowable to perform schema operations on the current database. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class, which uses the MigrationRecorder, also does not interact with the router to adjust its behavior based on the allow_migrate rules. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that deal with ensuring schema, recording applied migrations, and those parts of the MigrationExecutor that involve schema operations. The identified code spans include the whole MigrationRecorder class and parts of the MigrationExecutor class. These spans need to be modified or extended to integrate with the database router to respect the allow_migrate rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
