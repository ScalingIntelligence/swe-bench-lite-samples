The user wants to ensure that tables are only created on the 'default' connection and not on other connections. There are several relevant parts in the codebase that handle migrations and database operations. The 'MigrationRecorder' class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' is responsible for recording applied migrations and ensuring the schema. The 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema' method is particularly relevant as it checks if the 'Migration' model is in the tables of the connection and tries to create the table if it is not found. This behavior needs to be adjusted to respect the database router rules. The 'MigrationExecutor' class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' is also relevant as it handles the application of migrations and the creation of project states. The 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' defines the 'allow_migrate' method, which determines if a migration is allowed on a specified database. These parts of the code are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue. The focus should be on modifying the 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema' method to respect the 'allow_migrate' rules defined by the router.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
