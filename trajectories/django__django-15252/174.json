The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder should not create tables on non-default databases when a router is in place to restrict such operations. The provided search results and context highlight several relevant methods within the MigrationRecorder class, including ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_unapplied. These methods directly deal with the schema and recording of migration states, which are critical for the issue at hand. Specifically, ensure_schema is responsible for creating the migration table if it does not exist, and it currently does not check the allow_migrate rules before creating the table. This is a clear mismatch with the expected behavior described in the issue. Similarly, applied_migrations and record_unapplied do not appear to account for the router's allow_migrate decision, which could lead to incorrect recording of migrations on databases where migrations should not be applied. To address the issue, these methods need to be updated to incorporate checks against the router's allow_migrate method. This integration should prevent operations on databases that are not allowed by the router.\n\nGiven the identified gaps in the current code, the relevant code spans to address the issue are the ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_unapplied methods. These spans should be considered for modification to align with the db_router's allow_migrate rules.",

The expectation is that the MigrationRecorder should respect the router's decisions about which databases should have migrations applied to them. The current behavior, as described, seems to attempt to create the 'django_migrations' table on all connections, regardless of the allow_migrate rule. This behavior potentially violates the intended functionality of the router. The relevance of the provided search results and code spans can be broken down as follows:\n1. The `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/migrations/executor.py` files contain the core logic for MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor, which are central to the issue as they manage the recording and application of migrations.\n2. The `django/db/utils.py` contains the ConnectionRouter class, which is responsible for routing database operations based on the defined rules, including the allow_migrate method. This is directly relevant to the issue as it defines the policy Django should follow regarding database migrations.\n3. The `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` and `django/db/migrations/loader.py` files are also relevant, as they handle the execution and loading of migrations, which involves interactions with the MigrationRecorder and potentially bypassing the db_router.\n4. The `allow_migrate` method in ConnectionRouter is expected to be consulted before creating or altering tables in any database, but it appears that this is not consistently honored in the MigrationRecorder logic.\n\nGiven these points, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially rectifying the issue regarding the MigrationRecorder not obeying the db_router allow_migrate rules. The oversight seems to be that the logic for ensuring the schema (ensure_schema) does not check if the current database is allowed to apply migrations before attempting to create the 'django_migrations' table. This check likely needs to be added to respect the router's decisions.",

The broader context of Django's migration handling involves the `MigrationExecutor` class, which interacts closely with `MigrationRecorder`. Specifically, `MigrationExecutor`'s `apply_migration` method records migrations. However, examining other parts of the codebase that might initiate or record migrations without properly honoring `db_router` rules could be beneficial.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
