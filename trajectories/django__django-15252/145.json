            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the MigrationRecorder not obeying the `allow_migrate` rules defined in the database router. This results in tables being created in non-default databases. To address this, we need to focus on the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods such as `record_applied`, `ensure_schema`, `has_table`, and `applied_migrations`. We also need to inspect the `MigrationExecutor`, `BaseDatabaseCreation`, and the `ConnectionRouter` classes to understand how migrations are applied and how the database router rules are supposed to be respected. Given the complexity of the issue, multiple search parameters will be used to ensure all relevant aspects are covered.",

The relevant code spans identified are primarily within the `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/migrations/executor.py` files. These files contain the key methods like `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema`, `MigrationRecorder.record_applied`, `MigrationExecutor.apply_migration`, and `MigrationExecutor.record_migration` that are central to the migration process and where the issue seems to lie. The `ensure_schema` method checks for the presence of the migration table and creates it if it does not exist, which is against the expected behavior dictated by the router. This method directly impacts the creation of the migration table and thus must respect the `allow_migrate` rules. Similarly, the `record_applied` method is used to record that a migration has been applied, which also needs to align with the router's decisions. Furthermore, the `MigrationExecutor` class interacts closely with the `MigrationRecorder`, and its methods must also consider the router settings. These identified spans are crucial to addressing the issue as they deal directly with the schema and migration recording, which are central to the problem described.",

The search results include relevant code spans from `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, and `django/db/utils.py`. Specifically, the `MigrationRecorder` class in `recorder.py` handles the recording of applied migrations and the creation of the `django_migrations` table, which should be created only if allowed by the router. The `MigrationExecutor` class in `executor.py` oversees the migration process, including the application of migrations and recording them using `MigrationRecorder`. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `utils.py` defines the `allow_migrate` method that determines whether a model can be migrated to a given database. These components collectively establish the flow of migration handling, where `MigrationRecorder`'s behavior to create tables should respect the `allow_migrate` rules set by the router.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
