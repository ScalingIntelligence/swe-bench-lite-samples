These methods manage the creation and recording of migrations and do not currently take into account the 'allow_migrate' rules from the DB router. The 'ensure_schema' method lacks logic to check the DB router's decision before attempting to create the migration table. The 'applied_migrations' and 'record_unapplied' methods might also need adjustments to integrate with the DB router's decisions. The 'MigrationExecutor' class and its methods like 'apply_migration' and 'record_migration' are also relevant as they interact directly with 'MigrationRecorder'. The 'ConnectionRouter' class is worth considering for completeness but primarily serves as a reference on how DB routers are typically implemented and consulted in Django's multi-db handling.",

The MigrationRecorder class and its methods ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied are all present. These methods are crucial for managing the migration states and ensuring the schema is compliant with the migrations. The MigrationExecutor class also interacts with MigrationRecorder, ensuring that migrations are applied and recorded as intended. The code provided seems sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue reported about MigrationRecorder not respecting db_router's allow_migrate rules in a multi-db setup. However, direct checks and adjustments related to the router's allow_migrate rules within these methods are not explicitly detailed, suggesting a need to ensure these methods integrate with the router correctly.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a concern with the MigrationRecorder class not adhering to the db_router's allow_migrate rules, specifically preventing table creation on non-'default' database connections. Reviewing the provided code spans, the relevant sections are primarily in the `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` file, which contains the MigrationRecorder class with methods like `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied`. The `ensure_schema` method, in particular, directly deals with the creation of the django_migrations table if it doesn't already exist, which is a critical point of concern since it currently does not check the db_router's allow_migrate rules before attempting table creation. This behavior could lead to table creation on non-'default' databases. Additionally, the `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` methods call `ensure_schema`, implying they are also implicated in the issue. In the `django/db/migrations/executor.py` file, the MigrationExecutor class uses the MigrationRecorder, further supporting the need to ensure the recorder respects the db_router rules. Due to the direct interactions and dependencies between these methods and classes, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue. Specifically, enhancements are needed in the `ensure_schema` method to enforce db_router checks before schema operations to ensure compliance with the defined database routing rules. The existing context and search results provide a comprehensive view of the areas needing adjustment.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
