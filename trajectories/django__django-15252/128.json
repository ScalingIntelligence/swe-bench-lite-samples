The provided search results include key sections of the Django codebase that are relevant to this issue. Specifically, the MigrationRecorder class in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` contains methods like `ensure_schema` and `record_applied` that directly deal with ensuring the schema and recording applied migrations. These methods do not currently check the db_router's allow_migrate rules before performing actions like creating tables. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` uses the MigrationRecorder, suggesting that the issue could propagate through the migration application process. The BaseDatabaseCreation class in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` is also relevant as it deals with creating test databases, which is where the issue is observed. The ConnectionRouter class in `django/db/utils.py` is the basis for db_routers and includes the allow_migrate method that should be consulted before any database schema-altering actions. These findings suggest a potential gap in the MigrationRecorder's respect for db_router rules, requiring a closer look at the mechanisms for checking and applying these rules in migration-related actions.",

Additionally, the MigrationExecutor's 'apply_migration' method also interacts with the MigrationRecorder, indicating a direct linkage to the issue's concerns. The base creation class for databases in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' also interacts with the DB router, further affirming the relevance of the provided context.

The MigrationRecorder class is responsible for recording applied migrations, and its 'ensure_schema' method is of particular interest as it deals with the creation of the schema if it doesn't already exist. This method does not currently appear to consult the DB router to determine whether it should create the schema on the current connection. The MigrationExecutor class, on the other hand, orchestrates the application of migrations and interacts with the MigrationRecorder. Given the nature of the issue, it's critical to verify that all interactions with the database respect the settings defined by the DB router, particularly in regards to the 'allow_migrate' rule. Additional scrutiny is warranted on the 'loader.py' module, which is involved in loading migration data, to ensure that it properly adheres to the routing rules when handling migrations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the behavior of the MigrationRecorder in a multi-db setup when dealing with db_router's allow_migrate rules. The key problem is that the MigrationRecorder is not respecting the router's decision to only allow migrations on the 'default' database, potentially creating tables on other databases. This involves several key components: the MigrationRecorder class itself and its methods such as ensure_schema and record_applied, which should respect the allow_migrate rule. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods like apply_migration and record_migration are involved in applying migrations and recording them. The BaseDatabaseCreation class and its method _create_test_db are also relevant as they handle the creation of test databases during the migration process. Lastly, the ConnectionRouter class and its method allow_migrate determine which databases migrations are allowed on.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, the specific code spans identified as relevant include the MigrationRecorder's methods like ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied, which directly interact with the database and need to check the allow_migrate rule before performing actions. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration and record_migration methods are important as they use the MigrationRecorder and need to respect the routing rules. The BaseDatabaseCreation's _create_test_db method is also relevant as it sets up the test environment, which triggers migration processes.\n\nBased on the analysis, the search results contain the necessary code spans that address the issue. The relevant code spans involve all the identified methods within the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes, as well as the _create_test_db method in the BaseDatabaseCreation class. These spans cover the full lifecycle of migrations from ensuring the schema, recording applied migrations, applying migrations, and creating test databases, ensuring a comprehensive understanding and context to address the reported issue.",

However, the 'ensure_schema' method, which is crucial for creating the table to record migrations, does not appear to consult the DB router to ascertain if the current connection is allowed to perform schema operations. This omission could be the source of the issue where the schema is created in databases where it should not be, thereby violating the 'allow_migrate' rule set by the DB router. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor is used to apply migrations and interacts closely with the MigrationRecorder. The 'apply_migration' method in MigrationExecutor does not explicitly check with the router before applying a migration, which could inadvertently lead to migrations being applied where they are not allowed. This scenario is further complicated by the interaction with the 'loader.py' module, which is responsible for loading migration data. To address this, a comprehensive review of how the 'loader.py' module interacts with the DB router settings, especially in contexts where it fetches or processes migration data, is essential.

Specifically, the MigrationRecorder is responsible for ensuring the schema for recording migrations exists and recording that a migration has been applied. However, the 'ensure_schema' method, which is crucial for creating the table to record migrations, does not appear to consult the DB router to ascertain if the current connection is allowed to perform schema operations. This omission could be the source of the issue where the schema is created in databases where it should not be, thereby violating the 'allow_migrate' rule set by the DB router. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor is used to apply migrations and interacts closely with the MigrationRecorder. The 'apply_migration' method in MigrationExecutor does not explicitly check with the router before applying a migration, which could inadvertently lead to migrations being applied where they are not allowed. This scenario is further complicated by the interaction with the 'loader.py' module, which is responsible for loading migration data. To address this, a comprehensive review of how the 'loader.py' module interacts with the DB router settings, especially in contexts where it fetches or processes migration data, is essential. This includes ensuring that the 'loader.py' module correctly respects the routing rules when deciding which database migrations should be loaded or considered for application.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
