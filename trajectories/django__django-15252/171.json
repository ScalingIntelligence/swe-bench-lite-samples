The expected behavior is that tables should only be created on the 'default' connection, but the MigrationRecorder is creating tables on other connections. The problem lies in the ensure_schema method of MigrationRecorder which checks for the Migration model table and attempts to create it if it does not exist. Relevant files and methods include MigrationRecorder in django/db/migrations/recorder.py (particularly the ensure_schema method), ConnectionRouter in django/db/utils.py (focus on allow_migrate and allow_migrate_model methods), and MigrationExecutor in django/db/migrations/executor.py (specifically the apply_migration method which calls record_applied).",

The issue describes that the `MigrationRecorder` is not obeying these rules, causing tables to be created in non-default databases. By analyzing the provided code spans, it's clear that the `MigrationRecorder` class in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` has a method `ensure_schema` that checks if the `Migration` model is in the tables of the connection and tries to create the table if it doesn't exist. This behavior seems to be at the core of the problem since it doesn't respect the `allow_migrate` rules set by the router. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` directly calls methods on `MigrationRecorder`, which might also contribute to the issue. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` defines the `allow_migrate` method but doesn't seem to influence the behavior of `MigrationRecorder`. Therefore, the key spans of code that need to be addressed are those in `MigrationRecorder` and `MigrationExecutor`.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
