The problem seems to occur during the creation of test databases and the recording of applied migrations. The main areas of concern are the ensure_schema method in the MigrationRecorder class and the apply_migration method in the MigrationExecutor class. To find the exact code and context where the issue might be, I need to search for relevant code snippets related to these methods, the MigrationRecorder class, and the MigrationExecutor class.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the MigrationRecorder in a multi-db setup when using a custom router to control database migrations. The router is designed to allow migrations only on the 'default' database, but the MigrationRecorder is creating the table 'django_migrations' on other databases as well. This is observed during the execution of the 'migrate' command in functional tests. The search results include code from two files: 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. In 'recorder.py', the relevant code spans involve the methods related to schema management and recording migrations: 'ensure_schema', 'applied_migrations', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied'. These methods are responsible for managing the 'django_migrations' table and recording whether migrations have been applied or unapplied. The 'ensure_schema' method checks for the existence of the 'django_migrations' table and creates it if it doesn't exist, without considering the database router's rules. This behavior is problematic as it leads to table creation on databases other than 'default'. In 'executor.py', the relevant code spans involve the methods that interact with the MigrationRecorder, such as 'migrate', 'apply_migration', 'record_migration', and 'unapply_migration'. These methods handle the execution of migrations and their recording. The issue is that these methods do not check with the router before ensuring schema or recording migrations, which leads to incorrect database behavior. Identifying and modifying these methods will be crucial to ensure they respect the database router's allow_migrate rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
