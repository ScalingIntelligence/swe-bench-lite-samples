The primary concern is that the MigrationRecorder tries to create tables on databases other than the 'default' one, which violates the defined router rules. The focus should be on the interaction between the MigrationRecorder and the db_router, especially in the methods ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations in the MigrationRecorder class. Also, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration method and the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method are crucial for understanding the flow and checking if the router rules are correctly enforced.",

This is against the expected behavior when a router is provided. The search results provide relevant code spans within django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py that are critical to understanding and potentially resolving this issue. The identified spans include methods such as 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied' in the MigrationRecorder class, which directly interact with the database and are likely points to introduce checks against the database router rules. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods 'apply_migration' and 'record_migration' are highlighted as they interact with the MigrationRecorder and are also key to the migration process.",

The provided search results and context reveal several key points where this can be addressed:\n\n1. **MigrationExecutor Actions**:\n   - The MigrationExecutor class is responsible for applying migrations. It initializes a MigrationRecorder instance for recording the migrations.\n   - The `apply_migration` method calls `self.recorder.record_applied` which in turn calls `self.ensure_schema()`.\n   - The `ensure_schema` method checks if the table exists and, if not, attempts to create it. This action could bypass the db_router rules.\n\n2. **MigrationRecorder Methods**:\n   - The `ensure_schema` method is central to the issue as it creates the table without considering the db_router rules.\n   - Methods like `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` also call `ensure_schema`, potentially leading to table creation on non-default databases.\n\n3. **Router Handling**:\n   - The ConnectionRouter class handles routing logic, including the `allow_migrate` method which needs to be respected by the MigrationRecorder.\n   - The existing `ensure_schema` implementation does not consult the router to decide whether table creation is permitted, thus leading to the reported issue.\n\nGiven these findings, the immediate steps to address the issue would involve modifying the `ensure_schema` method to check against the routing rules before attempting to create the table.",

Specifically, the expectation is that the `django_migrations` table should only be created on the 'default' database and not on any other databases. This involves verifying the behavior of `ensure_schema` in `MigrationRecorder` when called by `record_applied` and `record_unapplied`, ensuring that it does not create the table on databases other than 'default'. The search results provided include the relevant parts of `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, which demonstrate how the `MigrationRecorder` and `MigrationExecutor` classes interact with the database session and router settings. The identified code spans include initialization, schema enforcement, and migration recording methods that need to adhere to the database router's rules. However, it's essential to ensure that `ensure_schema` checks the database router's decision before attempting to create the migration table. Based on the analysis of the provided code and search results, the identified spans appear relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
