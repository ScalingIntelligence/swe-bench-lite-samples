The router's allow_migrate method should control which databases migrations are allowed on, but it appears the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method does not correctly respect these rules, leading to the creation of MigrationRecorder tables on non-default databases. To address this, we need to identify the relevant sections of code in the MigrationRecorder and related classes that handle the recording of migrations and ensure their compliance with the database router. From the search results, it's clear that the MigrationRecorder class and the MigrationExecutor class are key, as they handle the actual recording and application of migrations. Additionally, understanding how the ConnectionRouter interacts with these classes is crucial to resolve the issue. The ConnectionRouter class contains methods to determine whether a migration is allowed on a specific database, which should be consulted before any database schema changes. The spans identified from the search results include the initialization of the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor, as well as the methods used to record and apply migrations. These are crucial for understanding and applying the correct routing logic.",

The user expects that the Migration model table should not be created on connections other than the 'default' connection, despite the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method attempting to create it. The relevant code spans in the search results show the implementation of MigrationRecorder methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied, as well as their usage in the MigrationExecutor class. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method is also relevant, as it determines which databases should be considered for migrations. Given the details provided and the code reviewed, the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

The main concern is that the ensure_schema method of MigrationRecorder tries to create the migration table without checking the router's allow_migrate rule, which could lead to table creation in databases where it should not occur. This is likely the primary reason for the unexpected behavior described. The identified spans in the search results, such as ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied, directly relate to the migration recording process and must be scrutinized for adherence to the router's rules.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
