Specifically, the MigrationRecorder tries to apply migrations on all connections, including those that should not have migrations applied based on the router. We need to focus on the MigrationRecorder and related methods like ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, as well as the ConnectionRouter and its allow_migrate method in django/db/utils.py. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor in django/db/migrations/executor.py and its methods for applying migrations could also be relevant. The search should prioritize these specific areas to pinpoint the exact points where the router rules are not being honored.",

The relevant code spans identified in the search results are primarily located in three files: 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', 'django/db/utils.py', and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. In 'recorder.py', the MigrationRecorder class methods `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` are crucial as they directly interact with the database schema and record migration status. The `ensure_schema` method, in particular, checks for the existence of the Migration model table and attempts to create it if it does not exist. This behavior is problematic as it should respect the database router's allow_migrate rules. In 'utils.py', the ConnectionRouter class and its method `allow_migrate` are relevant as they determine whether a migration is allowed on a specified database. Finally, in 'executor.py', the MigrationExecutor class includes methods like `apply_migration` and `record_migration` that interact with the MigrationRecorder and are therefore also relevant to the issue. These methods call the MigrationRecorder methods responsible for recording migration application status. This comprehensive look at the code spans helps in understanding the flow of how migrations are applied and recorded, and where the issue of not respecting the db_router could occur.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
