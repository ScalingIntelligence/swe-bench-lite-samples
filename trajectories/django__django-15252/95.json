            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the MigrationRecorder's behavior in a multi-db setup where a custom database router is used to control migrations. The expected behavior is that migrations should only be applied to the 'default' database and not to other databases. However, the MigrationRecorder seems to incorrectly create tables on non-'default' databases, which violates the router's rules. To address this, we need to locate the specific parts of the code where the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database and ensure that it respects the router's allow_migrate rules. The relevant files and methods to investigate include MigrationRecorder in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, which has methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations that might not respect the router. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor in django/db/migrations/executor.py, which uses the MigrationRecorder, and the ConnectionRouter in django/db/utils.py, which defines the allow_migrate method, are crucial for understanding how the router's rules are (or are not) being applied during migrations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the misbehavior of the MigrationRecorder in obeying the db_router allow_migrate rules, particularly in multi-db setups. The MigrationRecorder should not create tables on connections other than the 'default' connection based on the defined router rules. The search results include relevant code spans from three files: django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/migrations/executor.py, and django/db/utils.py. In django/db/migrations/recorder.py, several methods of the MigrationRecorder class are identified as crucial: ensure_schema(), applied_migrations(), record_applied(), and record_unapplied(). These methods are directly involved in ensuring the schema, recording applied migrations, and recording unapplied migrations. The ensure_schema() method particularly checks if the Migration model is in the tables of the connection and tries to create the table if it does not exist. This behavior is central to the issue reported. In django/db/migrations/executor.py, the MigrationExecutor class includes methods that interact with MigrationRecorder, such as migrate(), apply_migration(), record_migration(), and unapply_migration(). These methods are important as they orchestrate the migration process and interface with the MigrationRecorder. The ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py also pertains to the issue as it manages the routing of database operations based on the router rules, including allow_migrate(). The allow_migrate() method in this class is critical as it determines whether a migration is allowed on a specific database. Identifying and analyzing these code spans helps in understanding how the MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and ConnectionRouter work together and why the MigrationRecorder might not be obeying the db_router allow_migrate rules. Furthermore, these spans provide the necessary context to investigate and potentially address the issue where migrations are being recorded or applied inappropriately to databases other than 'default'.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
