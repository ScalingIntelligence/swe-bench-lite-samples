Specifically, it is expected that migrations should only be applied to the 'default' database as per the router's allow_migrate rules, but currently, the MigrationRecorder attempts to create a table in non-'default' databases. This suggests a need to investigate the methods like ensure_schema() in MigrationRecorder, the allow_migrate method in ConnectionRouter, and the apply_migration method in MigrationExecutor to understand why the router's rules are not being respected.",

The code also involves the MigrationExecutor class and its methods like apply_migration and record_migration which interact with the MigrationRecorder. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method are also relevant as they decide which databases are allowed to have migrations applied. The analysis should focus on how these methods honor the db_router's rules and whether they correctly handle the creation and checking of migration tables according to the db_router's instructions. The search results have provided relevant code spans that directly relate to these functionalities. The next step would be to ensure these methods correctly implement the db_router's decisions.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
