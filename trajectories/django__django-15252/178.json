This is problematic because it results in tables being created in databases where they should not be, based on the router's configuration. The key focus should be on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, especially those related to ensuring schema existence and recording applied migrations. Additionally, it's critical to examine the interaction between the MigrationRecorder and the database router. Consequently, the search should initially target files containing the MigrationRecorder and ConnectionRouter classes, and also look for specific methods such as `allow_migrate`, `record_applied`, and `ensure_schema`. Furthermore, it's necessary to find the part of the codebase where the `migrate` command is executed and where the test databases are set up, which could call these methods inappropriately.",

The provided code snippet in <file_context> shows the relevant parts of the MigrationRecorder class, particularly the ensure_schema method, which creates the 'django_migrations' table if it doesn't exist. This behavior is at the heart of the issue as it doesn't check the db_router's allow_migrate rules before creating the table. Additionally, the record_applied and record_unapplied methods also call ensure_schema, suggesting a possible recurrence of the issue when recording migrations. In the <search_results>, the same relevant parts from django/db/migrations/recorder.py are present, confirming the core issue. Additionally, django/db/utils.py shows the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method, highlighting where the decision to allow migration is made according to the db_router rules. This search result is crucial as it shows the point where the rule is applied, further emphasizing the need for the ensure_schema method to consult these rules before proceeding with table creation.",

The focus is on ensuring that the MigrationRecorder respects the decisions made by the db_router about where migrations should be applied. In reviewing the provided file context, it is observed that the MigrationRecorder does call the 'ensure_schema' method, which checks for the presence of the 'django_migrations' table and attempts to create it if it doesn't exist, without evident consideration of the 'allow_migrate' rule. This behavior could lead to tables being created in databases where they should not be, as per the custom router's configuration. Therefore, the relevant code for the reported issue is identified, but it appears that the critical part of checking and applying the 'allow_migrate' rule within the MigrationRecorder's methods (such as 'ensure_schema') is missing or not explicitly outlined in the provided file context. More detailed examination of the interaction between MigrationRecorder and the database routers would be necessary to confirm the integration of the 'allow_migrate' check in the schema creation process.",

This behavior violates the expected functionality of the router's allow_migrate method. The provided search results show the relevant parts of the MigrationRecorder class, including its methods ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied, all of which could be involved in the misbehavior described. Additionally, the file django/db/backends/base/creation.py contains the create_test_db method, which triggers the migration process and thus is also relevant to the issue.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
