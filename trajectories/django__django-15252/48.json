            "scratch_pad": "The issue reported revolves around the behavior of the MigrationRecorder in a multi-db setup where the `allow_migrate` rule in a custom router should prevent migrations from being applied to non-'default' databases. The current implementation of MigrationRecorder does not respect this rule and attempts to create the django_migrations table in all connections, regardless of the router's allow_migrate method.\n\nGiven the context, the main focus is on the `ensure_schema` method in MigrationRecorder, as it is responsible for checking if the Migration model table exists and creating it if it does not. The issue likely lies in how this method interacts with the database connection and the router.\n\nFrom the search results, the `MigrationExecutor` class is relevant as it uses the `MigrationRecorder` and governs the migration process. Specifically, the `migrate` method in `MigrationExecutor` calls `self.recorder.ensure_schema()`, which implies that the `MigrationRecorder`'s behavior directly affects the migration process across databases.\n\nThe identified spans in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` are: 'MigrationRecorder.__init__', 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema', and 'MigrationRecorder.record_applied', as these methods are crucial for understanding how the recorder interacts with the database and how it might be bypassing the router's rules.\n\nIn `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor ` class and its methods provide further context on how migrations are applied and how the `MigrationRecorder` is utilized during this process. Notably, the `migrate` method and its interaction with `self.recorder.ensure_schema()` is of particular interest.\n\nBased on this analysis, the search task is complete as the identified code spans directly relate to the reported issue's concerns and provide a solid foundation for understanding and potentially resolving the problem.",

This disregards the 'allow_migrate' rules defined in the router. The search results provide extensive context around the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes, which are central to the migration process. The relevant parts include the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder, which is responsible for creating the 'django_migrations' table if it doesn't exist, and the record_applied method, which records that a migration has been applied. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration and migrate methods are key, as they interact directly with the MigrationRecorder. The issue lies in the fact that these methods do not check the 'allow_migrate' rule before attempting to create or modify the 'django_migrations' table. This oversight leads to the table being created on all databases, irrespective of the router's rules. The provided search results are thorough and cover all the essential parts of the migration process that need to be reviewed and possibly modified to respect the DB router's 'allow_migrate' rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
