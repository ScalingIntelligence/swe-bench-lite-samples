The key concern is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the allow_migrate rules of the router and creates tables on all connections, not just the 'default' connection. To address this, we need to identify code spans that deal with the creation and recording of migrations, particularly focusing on the ensure_schema and record_applied methods. From the provided search results, we find relevant code spans in two files: 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. In 'recorder.py', the spans for 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema' and 'MigrationRecorder.record_applied' are particularly relevant. These methods deal with ensuring the schema for migration recording and recording applied migrations, respectively. In 'executor.py', the 'MigrationExecutor.apply_migration' method, which invokes the MigrationRecorder's methods, is also pertinent. This method is responsible for applying migrations and recording them, thus closely related to the issue at hand. The 'ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate' method in 'django/db/utils.py' is also crucial as it deals with the routing logic for migrations, indicating where migrations are allowed to be applied. Together, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of where the changes are needed to ensure that the MigrationRecorder obeys the db_router's allow_migrate rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
