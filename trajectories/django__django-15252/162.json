This can lead to unintended table creation in databases other than the 'default' one. To address this, we should investigate the following areas: the MigrationRecorder class for its ensure_schema and record_applied methods, the MigrationExecutor class for how it applies and records migrations, and the ConnectionRouter class which manages database routing rules. Additionally, the creation of test databases should be examined, specifically in the context of how migrations are applied during test setup. The focus should be on ensuring that only the 'default' database is targeted for migration actions when a custom router is in use.",

Specifically, the issue is that the MigrationRecorder tries to create the Migration table on connections other than the 'default' one, which is not the expected behavior given the router's rules. The relevant code spans in the search results include the MigrationRecorder class and its methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, applied_migrations, and has_table in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`. These methods are key to understanding how the MigrationRecorder interacts with the database and how it checks for and ensures the existence of the Migration model's table. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` are relevant as they interact with the MigrationRecorder and are responsible for applying migrations. Specifically, methods like apply_migration and migrate could be places where the MigrationRecorder's behavior is used. Lastly, the ConnectionRouter class in `django/db/utils.py` is also relevant as it is responsible for routing database operations according to the custom router's rules, including the allow_migrate method. The code spans in these files indicate how migrations are applied and recorded, and how database operations are routed, which directly relate to the issue reported.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
