The primary focus is on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly those related to recording migrations and ensuring schema. The relevant files context provided points to several Django core files, focusing on migration handling, database creation, and connection routing. These files likely contain the functions and methods that need to be investigated to resolve the issue. Specifically, the MigrationRecorder class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and the ConnectionRouter methods in 'django/db/utils.py' are of particular interest. The search should focus on these files and the exact implementation of the router's rules within these contexts.",

The key elements to identify in the code are the methods in MigrationRecorder class that ensure the schema and record migrations, as well as the logic in the ConnectionRouter class that determines where migrations are allowed. By examining the code, it's clear that the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method does not check the db_router's allow_migrate rules before attempting to create the 'django_migrations' table. This oversight can lead to unwanted table creations in non-default databases. Additionally, the applied_migrations and record_unapplied methods utilize ensure_schema, suggesting they might also be affected by this issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those related to ensuring the schema and recording migrations in the MigrationRecorder class, and the method that routes migrations in the ConnectionRouter class.",

The key problem identified is that the MigrationRecorder is attempting to create the 'django_migrations' table on non-default databases, which contradicts the router's rules. From the provided context and search results, it is evident that the MigrationRecorder class has methods that handle checking for the existence of the 'django_migrations' table and creating it if it doesn't exist. Notably, the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder is responsible for creating the table and does not currently check the db_router rules. This is likely the root cause of the issue. Additionally, methods such as record_applied and record_unapplied also call ensure_schema, suggesting they may also contribute to the problem if not handled properly. The ConnectionRouter class, which handles routing based on the defined rules, does have an allow_migrate method that should be consulted before any schema changes. It is therefore essential to integrate checks against the routing rules in the MigrationRecorder to ensure that schema changes only occur on appropriate databases.",

Specifically, the issue points out that when migrations are applied, the MigrationRecorder tries to create the django_migrations table in all connections, not just the 'default' connection as specified by the router. The current context and search results provide significant insight into how the MigrationRecorder is implemented and how it interacts with the database. The relevant sections of code include the ensure_schema method which checks for the existence of the django_migrations table and creates it if it does not exist, and the record_applied and record_unapplied methods which use ensure_schema. These methods do not currently check the database router's allow_migrate rules before creating or using the table. The process to resolve this issue would involve adding checks to ensure that operations are only performed on databases where allow_migrate returns True. The ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py provides the allow_migrate method, which could be leveraged in the MigrationRecorder to respect the router's decisions.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
