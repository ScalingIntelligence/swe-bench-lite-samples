This leads to the creation of Migration model tables in databases other than the 'default' one, which is not intended. The focus should be on the files and functions related to the MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and the db_router's allow_migrate method. Specifically, we need to look into `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` for the MigrationRecorder class, `django/db/migrations/executor.py` for the MigrationExecutor class, and `django/db/utils.py` for the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method. We should also consider examining `django/db/migrations/executor.py` for the `apply_migration` function and `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` for the `record_applied` function to see how the schema ensuring and recording of migrations are handled.",

Specifically, the issue points out that the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method creates tables in databases other than 'default', which contradicts the router's intention. This behavior is evident in the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method, where it checks if the table exists and, if not, attempts to create it without considering the router's allow_migrate rules. The MigrationExecutor's apply_migration and record_migration methods also involve recording applied migrations, which should respect the router's rules. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method, which controls which databases migrations are allowed on, should be integrated more closely with the MigrationRecorder's operations to ensure compliance.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
