The provided search results offer insights into key components related to this issue. Firstly, the 'ConnectionRouter' class in 'django/db/utils.py' defines the 'allow_migrate' method, which is crucial for routing decisions during migrations. This method iterates over configured routers and checks if a migration is allowed, which directly relates to the custom router's functionality mentioned in the issue. Secondly, the 'MigrationRecorder' class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' contains the 'ensure_schema' method, which is responsible for creating the 'Migration' table if it doesn't exist. This method should respect the 'allow_migrate' rules, which is a critical point of the issue. Lastly, 'BaseDatabaseCreation' in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' handles the creation of test databases, which involves running migrations, thus interacting with the 'allow_migrate' logic. Based on these findings, it's evident that the identified code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue, as they encompass the core functionality where the problem is likely to occur.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
