Specifically, the MigrationRecorder should respect the allow_migrate rules set by the router, but it currently attempts to create tables in databases other than the 'default' one. To address this, we need to locate the methods in the MigrationRecorder class that handle schema creation and migration recording, as well as the parts of the codebase where the migrate command is executed and where the test databases are set up. We should also look into the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter to understand how it should influence the behavior of the MigrationRecorder.",

The issue specifically points out that the `ensure_schema` method of the `MigrationRecorder` class does not respect the router's `allow_migrate` rule, leading to the creation of the 'django_migrations' table in databases other than 'default'. This behavior is problematic for a multi-db setup where certain databases should not have tables managed by Django. \n\nIn the provided search results, the following code spans are relevant:\n1. `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema`: This method currently does not check the router's `allow_migrate` rule. It directly checks for the presence of the 'django_migrations' table and creates it if it does not exist. This could be the root cause of the issue as it bypasses the router.\n2. `MigrationRecorder.record_applied` and `MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied`: These methods call `ensure_schema` without checking the router, indicating that they could also be part of the issue.\n3. `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate`: This method is relevant as it is used by the router to determine if a migration is allowed on a database. It should be consulted by `MigrationRecorder` to respect the router's decisions.\n\nGiven these points, the identified spans appear to be the core component of the issue. Refactoring the `MigrationRecorder` methods to consult the router's `allow_migrate` rule before acting could resolve the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
