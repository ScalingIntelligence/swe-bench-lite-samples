The user expects that migrations should only be applied to the 'default' database and not to other databases, but the current behavior creates tables in other databases, which violates the router's rules.\n\nTo address this, we need to identify the relevant portions of the codebase that handle migration recording and applying. The search results include sections of code from django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/migrations/executor.py, and django/db/utils.py. These files are crucial as they handle the recording of applied migrations and the application of migrations themselves.\n\nSpecifically, the MigrationRecorder class and its methods (like ensure_schema) in django/db/migrations/recorder.py are relevant because they handle the recording of applied migrations and schema checks. The MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py is also relevant as it uses the MigrationRecorder to apply migrations. Lastly, the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py is relevant as it determines which databases are allowed to receive migrations according to the database router.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue are those that involve the MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and ConnectionRouter classes and their methods.",

Specifically, the 'allow_migrate' method in a custom router is expected to control which databases can have the 'django_migrations' table created or accessed. The current implementation of MigrationRecorder does not appear to consult the router's 'allow_migrate' method before checking or creating the 'django_migrations' table. This could lead to the table being created on non-'default' databases, which is the problem identified. In the provided file context and search results, several key methods are relevant: 'ensure_schema' in MigrationRecorder is responsible for creating the 'django_migrations' table if it does not exist, and this method does not check the 'allow_migrate' rules before proceeding. The 'record_applied' and 'record_unapplied' methods also call 'ensure_schema', indicating that they might also need to be adjusted to respect the router rules. These methods are linked to the broader functionality provided by MigrationExecutor, which initializes a MigrationRecorder instance in its constructor and uses it during migration application. The ConnectionRouter class, encapsulating the database routing logic, includes the 'allow_migrate' method, which is the key rule-checking method that should ideally be consulted before any schema-altering actions by MigrationRecorder. To address the issue, modifications would need to be made to the MigrationRecorder class to integrate checks against the 'allow_migrate' method of the database router before any operations that might alter database schemas. This would ensure that only databases allowed by the router's rules are subjected to migration recording operations.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
