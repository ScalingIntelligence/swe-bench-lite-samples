The user has identified that the MigrationRecorder's methods like ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied do not properly adhere to these rules. Specifically, the ensure_schema method checks for the presence of the Migration model table in the connection, and if not found, attempts to create the table. This action should be conditional based on the db_router's allow_migrate rule to prevent table creation on non-'default' connections. The relevant code spans from the search results are those that directly deal with schema ensuring, migration recording, and the router's migration allowance decision-making. These include MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied methods, as well as ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method. These selections align with the user's reported issue and the functionality they expect. By focusing on these specific code spans, we can better assess and possibly address the issue where the MigrationRecorder is not respecting the db_router rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
