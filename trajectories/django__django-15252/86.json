Specifically, it seems that the MigrationRecorder is not respecting the db_router's allow_migrate rules, leading to the creation of migration tables in databases other than the 'default' one. To address this, we need to focus on the code that handles the recording of applied migrations, schema ensuring, and ideally, find any references or usage of the allow_migrate method in the context of the MigrationRecorder. We should also consider reviewing the MigrationExecutor and BaseDatabaseCreation, as these could be involved in the migration process that triggers the recorder's behavior.",

The key problem identified is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's 'allow_migrate' rules, potentially leading to the creation of the 'django_migrations' table in databases where it should not be created. To address this issue, it is crucial to examine the methods in the MigrationRecorder class that interact with the database schema and the migration records, specifically: ensure_schema, applied_migrations, record_applied, and record_unapplied. Additionally, checking the ConnectionRouter class to understand how the allow_migrate method is implemented and used can provide a broader context.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
