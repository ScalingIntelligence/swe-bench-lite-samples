The expectation is that the Migration table should only be created in the 'default' database and not in others when a router is defined. Key areas to investigate include the behavior of ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_unapplied methods in relation to the db_router. Target files should focus on migration management and database backend operations where these methods are defined or invoked.",

Specifically, the issue is that the MigrationRecorder is not respecting the router's rules by attempting to create the 'django_migrations' table on connections other than 'default', which violates the expected behavior dictated by the router. The provided search results include several key spans from the django/db/migrations/recorder.py file, which is directly related to the MigrationRecorder class. The spans cover key methods such as 'ensure_schema', 'applied_migrations', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied', which are central to the class's handling of migration records and schema creation. Also included is the related MigrationExecutor class from django/db/migrations/executor.py, which interacts with the MigrationRecorder. These spans provide a comprehensive view of the logic that dictates how migration records are handled and schemas ensured, making them highly relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, it is clear that these code spans are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue and should be further examined and potentially modified to respect the db_router's rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
