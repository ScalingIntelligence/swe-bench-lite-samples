It is expected that tables for the Migration model should only be created in the 'default' database and not in any other database connections. However, the current behavior is that the MigrationRecorder tries to create the tables in all connections, disregarding the 'allow_migrate' rules.\n\nAfter analyzing the provided search results, it is apparent that several code spans within the MigrationRecorder class and related classes are directly relevant to the issue:\n1. The 'MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema' method checks if the Migration model table exists and, if not, attempts to create it. This behavior does not respect the 'allow_migrate' rules.\n2. The 'MigrationExecutor.migrate' method and its related methods, such as 'apply_migration' and 'record_migration', directly interact with the MigrationRecorder, which could lead to the incorrect creation of tables if the 'allow_migrate' rules are not respected.\n3. The 'BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db' method runs the 'migrate' command, which is potentially where the issue manifests in the context of test databases.\n\nThese code spans are crucial for addressing the issue, as they involve the core logic responsible for schema creation, migration application, and the setup of test databases. They need to be modified to respect the 'allow_migrate' rules, ensuring that tables are only created in the 'default' database unless explicitly allowed by the router.",

The Router class provided in the issue ensures that tables are only created in the 'default' database. However, the current behavior of MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema() results in the table being created in all databases, not just the 'default'. This discrepancy needs to be addressed to align with the router's rules. The search results provide additional context on how MigrationRecorder and BaseDatabaseCreation handle the migration process and table creation. The relevant code spans include the initialization of MigrationRecorder, the methods has_table(), ensure_schema(), and the migration execution in BaseDatabaseCreation. These methods are crucial to understand how migrations are recorded and tables are created across different databases. The identified code spans from the search results are consistent with the ones identified in the file context, reinforcing the relevance of these parts to the reported issue.",

These methods do not currently check the allow_migrate rule from the router, which seems to be the core issue. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py handles the application of migrations and makes use of the MigrationRecorder.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
