The main problem is that the MigrationRecorder attempts to create tables on all connections, even when a router is in place to restrict this to only the 'default' connection. Identifying the relevant code in MigrationExecutor, MigrationRecorder, and ConnectionRouter is crucial for understanding and fixing this issue.",

Specifically, it points out that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules, leading to the creation of the 'django_migrations' table in databases where it should not be created. This is evidenced by the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder class, which checks if the 'django_migrations' table exists and, if not, attempts to create it. There is no explicit mention or check of the db_router's allow_migrate rules before creating this table. The ConnectionRouter class, responsible for routing database operations according to the rules defined in the routers, has an allow_migrate method that should be consulted. However, this method is not invoked in the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder. Based on the issue description and the current implementation, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the creation and existence check of the 'django_migrations' table in the MigrationRecorder class, as well as the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter class. These methods need to be integrated to ensure that the db_router's rules are respected during the migration process.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
