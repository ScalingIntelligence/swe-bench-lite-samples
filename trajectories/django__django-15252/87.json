The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder should not create tables in databases other than the 'default' one, as specified by the router. To address this, we need to investigate methods in MigrationRecorder, ConnectionRouter, MigrationExecutor, and possibly in BaseDatabaseCreation to ensure they respect the routing rules. Focus should be on methods like record_applied, ensure_schema, allow_migrate in ConnectionRouter, apply_migration in MigrationExecutor, and potentially _create_test_db in BaseDatabaseCreation.",

The search results provided include several relevant sections of code from the Django codebase. These sections include methods like ensure_schema, apply_migration, and record_applied in the MigrationRecorder class, which are directly related to the migration recording process. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class methods allow_migrate and allow_migrate_model are relevant as they handle the routing of migration actions. The MigrationExecutor class methods also play a crucial role in executing migrations and recording them. The BaseDatabaseCreation class is less relevant but provides context on how test databases are created and managed, which is indirectly related to the migration process in a test environment.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
