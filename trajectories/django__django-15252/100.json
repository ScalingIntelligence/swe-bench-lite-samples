            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the MigrationRecorder class within Django's migration system not respecting the 'allow_migrate' rules defined in a database router. Specifically, it is observed that tables are being created in databases other than the 'default' one, which contradicts the router's configuration. This discrepancy occurs during the migration process when the system attempts to record that a migration has been applied, specifically within the 'record_applied' method of the MigrationRecorder class. To address this, it is crucial to investigate and pinpoint where and how the 'ensure_schema' method in the MigrationRecorder class is checking for the presence of the Migration model and deciding to create tables. Additionally, the interaction between the MigrationExecutor and the MigrationRecorder classes need to be examined to ensure that the migrations are being applied appropriately according to the defined router rules.",

The relevant code spans are identified in both `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. In `recorder.py`, the `MigrationRecorder` class methods `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` are critical as they handle the recording of migrations and the schema creation. The `ensure_schema` method directly checks if the table exists and attempts to create it if not, which is the primary concern. In `executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class methods `apply_migration` and `record_migration` are relevant as they manage the application of migrations and the recording of applied migrations, which involves calling methods from `MigrationRecorder`. These code spans are directly related to the issue's core functionality regarding migration handling and recording. The `ConnectionRouter` class in `django/db/utils.py` is also relevant as it handles routing choices for database operations, including migrations, and its `allow_migrate` method is crucial for the reported issue as it determines whether to allow migrations on a specified database.",

Specifically, the MigrationRecorder class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' contains the 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied' methods that are central to the issue described. These methods are responsible for ensuring the schema and recording the migration status, but they do not currently check the 'allow_migrate' rules. The MigrationExecutor class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' leverages the MigrationRecorder and also interacts with the database router through methods like 'apply_migration' and 'record_migration'. These methods do not explicitly check the 'allow_migrate' rules before proceeding with migration actions, which confirms the reported issue. The ConnectionRouter class in 'django/db/utils.py' is also present, which includes the 'allow_migrate' method, showing the structure of how these rules are intended to be used. Given this context, it appears that the relevant parts are identified, but the critical integration point where 'allow_migrate' checks should be incorporated into the MigrationRecorder or MigrationExecutor is missing.

The analysis of the provided code spans reveals that the MigrationRecorder's methods ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied are critical as they interact directly with the database schema and the recording of migration states. These methods call ensure_schema, which checks for the existence of the 'django_migrations' table and creates it if it does not exist. This behavior might lead to the table being created in databases where it should not, based on the db_router's rules. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class is relevant due to its role in executing migrations and recording them using the MigrationRecorder. The ConnectionRouter class also plays a crucial role in determining which databases should be targeted for certain operations, including migrations.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
