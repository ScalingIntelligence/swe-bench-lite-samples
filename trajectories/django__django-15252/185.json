This leads to tables being created in databases where they should not be. The key areas to investigate are the MigrationRecorder class in django/db/migrations/recorder.py and the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py. Additionally, the apply_migration method in django/db/migrations/executor.py should be examined as it interacts with the MigrationRecorder. Focusing on these specific parts of the code will help identify where the logic might be failing to adhere to the db_router rules.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of Django's MigrationRecorder in a multi-db setup where it does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules. Specifically, the issue points out that tables are being created on databases other than the 'default' one, despite the router's configuration. Analyzing the provided search results, we can identify several key areas of interest.\n\nIn `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods such as `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` are relevant. These methods interact directly with the database to create the django_migrations table and record whether migrations have been applied or unapplied. The methods use `self.connection` directly without considering the router's allow_migrate rules, which seems to be the core problem.\n\nIn `django/db/utils.py`, the `ConnectionRouter` class and its methods like `allow_migrate` are used to determine which database should be used for migrations. This class is crucial for our understanding of the router logic but the current implementation of `MigrationRecorder` does not seem to consult this router before performing actions on the database.\n\nIn `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class and its methods such as `apply_migration` and `migrate` are relevant as they orchestrate the migration process and specifically call methods from `MigrationRecorder`. The issue highlighted suggests that these methods might not be checking the router rules before proceeding with migrations.\n\nTo address the issue, modifications would likely involve ensuring that the `MigrationRecorder` checks with `ConnectionRouter`'s allow_migrate method before creating tables or recording migration states. However, the search results do not yet include the exact code that might implement or call the allow_migrate method, so further investigation would be needed to confirm and, if necessary, extract this code.\n\nGiven the identified key areas, the current search results cover the main components involved in the reported issue, but do not include the exact implementation of `allow_migrate` being called within these methods. This suggests that while the main logic affecting the issue is present, the direct connection or usage of the router rules within the problematic methods is not yet detailed, indicating a partial completion of the search task.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
