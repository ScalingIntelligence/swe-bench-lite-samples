This is likely due to the ensure_schema method in the MigrationRecorder class, which attempts to create the Migration table if it doesn't exist without checking if it's allowed by the db_router. To address this, we should focus our search on the MigrationRecorder class and related methods in the django/db/migrations/recorder.py file, and also look into the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py, as it determines whether migrations are allowed on a given database. Additionally, check the apply_migration method in django/db/migrations/executor.py, as it directly involves the recording of applied migrations and could be where the conflict arises.",

The user expects that tables should not be created on connections other than the 'default' connection when a router is provided. To address this, we need to analyze the relevant sections in the search results, particularly the methods in the MigrationRecorder class. By examining the code spans provided, we can see that the MigrationRecorder class has methods such as ensure_schema(), applied_migrations(), record_applied(), and record_unapplied(), which all interact with the database schema and migration records. The ensure_schema() method, in particular, creates the Migration model table if it does not exist, which is likely where the current issue lies in terms of obeying the db_router rules. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class interacts with MigrationRecorder and applies migrations, which could also be relevant to understanding the broader context of the issue. This analysis suggests that the provided code spans are directly related to the reported issue and should be considered relevant.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
