Specifically, it mentions that the Migration model table is being created in non-'default' databases, which should not happen according to the router's rules. Relevant files and methods mentioned include: MigrationRecorder, ConnectionRouter, MigrationExecutor, and BaseDatabaseCreation. The search should focus on these classes and their methods to find where the schema creation logic might be ignoring the router settings.",

The issue states that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the allow_migrate rules specified in the router, leading to the creation of tables in databases that should not be migrated.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. The key methods in MigrationRecorder that need to respect the router's allow_migrate rules are ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied. These methods are responsible for creating the 'django_migrations' table and recording migration statuses, which should only occur in databases allowed by the router.\n\nThe MigrationExecutor class interacts with MigrationRecorder and is also relevant here, especially the apply_migration and unapply_migration methods, which call MigrationRecorder's methods. It's crucial to ensure that all operations involving migration records respect the router's allow_migrate decisions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans are directly related to the issue's core problem, which is the misbehavior of MigrationRecorder with respect to the database router's configuration.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
