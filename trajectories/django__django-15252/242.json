The problem is that MigrationRecorder is trying to create tables on non-'default' connections. To debug this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class, particularly the ensure_schema method, and also examine the interaction with the router in the MigrationExecutor and possibly other places where migrations are applied or recorded. Additionally, the setup_databases function in django/test/runner.py could be a key place to investigate how the test databases are handled during migrations.",

This results in the creation of the 'django_migrations' table in databases where it should not be created. After analyzing the provided context and search results, it's clear that the issue primarily involves the 'ensure_schema' method in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, which unconditionally checks for and attempts to create the 'django_migrations' table if it doesn't exist, without considering whether the current database is allowed to have this table according to the router's rules. This behavior needs to be adjusted to respect the allow_migrate decision. Additionally, the search results in django/db/migrations/executor.py demonstrate how the MigrationExecutor uses the MigrationRecorder, indicating that these classes collaborate closely in the migration process. These findings suggest that the solution should involve modifications in the 'ensure_schema' method to consult the database router when deciding whether to create the 'django_migrations' table.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
