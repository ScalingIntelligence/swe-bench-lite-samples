The problem arises when the MigrationRecorder tries to create tables in databases other than the 'default' one, despite the custom router's rules.

We should also consider relevant methods in 'django/db/utils.py' and 'django/db/backends/creation.py', as these files are related to database connection handling and creation, which can influence migration behavior during tests.",

This is aimed at maintaining a multi-db setup where only the 'default' connection should be affected by migrations.\n\nReviewing the search results, the key files and methods related to this issue are:\n\n1. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` - This file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class with methods `ensure_schema`, `applied_migrations`, and `record_applied`. These methods are crucial as they deal with ensuring the schema, checking applied migrations, and recording the application of migrations respectively. The issue specifically mentions `ensure_schema` creating tables when it should not, if the router rules dictate otherwise.\n\n2. `django/db/migrations/executor.py` - Here, the `MigrationExecutor` class initializes `MigrationRecorder` and uses it in methods like `apply_migration` and `record_migration` to apply and record migrations. These interactions need to respect the routing rules.\n\n3. `django/db/utils.py` - Contains the `ConnectionRouter` class that handles routing of database operations based on the rules defined by routers, including the `allow_migrate` method which is central to the router's decision-making about which databases should participate in migrations.\n\n4. `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` - While not directly containing the `MigrationRecorder` methods, this file does handle aspects related to database creation during tests, which is a context involving migrations that need to obey the routing rules.\n\nGiven these files and the specific methods within them, the relevant spans are those that involve creating, recording, and applying migrations, as well as those that handle the routing based on the `allow_migrate` rules.\n\nIt seems that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue, as they address the core functionalities affected by the problem. However, further inspection and potentially additional checks within the `MigrationRecorder` methods to honor the `allow_migrate` rules in the `ConnectionRouter` might be necessary to fully resolve the issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
