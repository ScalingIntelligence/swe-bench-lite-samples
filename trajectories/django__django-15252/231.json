The problem lies in the fact that the MigrationRecorder attempts to create the Migration table in all databases, ignoring the router's allow_migrate rules. This behavior is incorrect and should be confined to the 'default' database as per the router's rules. To address this, we need to examine the MigrationRecorder class and its methods to understand how and where it checks for the existence of the Migration table and how it attempts to create it. Additionally, we should review the MigrationExecutor class, as it interacts with the MigrationRecorder during migration application. We should also look at the setup_databases method in the test runner to see how it handles database creation and migration during tests.",

            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, the main concern is that the MigrationRecorder class in Django's migration system is not respecting the db_router's allow_migrate rules. Specifically, it should not create migration tables on databases other than 'default' when a router is in place. The search results include several relevant sections from Django's migration related files.\n\nFirst, in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', the MigrationRecorder class contains methods like 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied', which are critical for recording migration status. Notably, 'ensure_schema' checks for the presence of the Migration model table and creates it if it's missing, without checking the router's allow_migrate rule. This behavior could cause the table to be created on the wrong database.\n\nSecond, in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py', the BaseDatabaseCreation class has a 'create_test_db' method that calls the 'migrate' command. This is relevant because it shows how the test database setup interacts with migrations, potentially leading to the issue if the migration recorder does not respect the router.\n\nLastly, in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py', the MigrationExecutor class is responsible for executing migrations. It uses the MigrationRecorder and includes methods like 'apply_migration' and 'record_migration', which directly involve recording the application of migrations. The issue could stem from here if the executor does not properly check the router before instructing the recorder to record a migration.\n\nOverall, these sections of code are directly relevant to the issue reported, as they handle the recording and execution of database migrations, which need to respect the database router's rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
