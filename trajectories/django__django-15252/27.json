The main concern is that the MigrationRecorder is not respecting these rules and is attempting to create tables in non-'default' connections. To address this, we need to focus on the relevant sections of Django's migration system, specifically the MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and the database creation process during tests. We should search for occurrences of 'record_applied', 'ensure_schema', and 'allow_migrate' to pinpoint where this behavior originates and how it can be corrected.",

Specifically, the issue is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the allow_migrate rules defined in the db_router and inadvertently creates the Migration table in non-'default' databases. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans that could be contributing to this issue. Firstly, in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', the MigrationRecorder class and its methods such as '__init__' and 'record_applied' are relevant. The 'record_applied' method calls 'ensure_schema', which is a method that checks if the Migration model is in the tables and tries to create the table if it does not exist. This behavior could be the root cause of the issue reported. Secondly, in 'django/db/utils.py', the ConnectionRouter class and its method 'allow_migrate' are relevant as they define the routing logic for migrations. The 'allow_migrate' method should ideally prevent migrations from being applied to non-'default' databases but the issue suggests this is not happening correctly. Lastly, in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py', the MigrationExecutor class and its '__init__' method are relevant as they instantiate the MigrationRecorder. Similarly, in 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py', the BaseDatabaseCreation class and its 'create_test_db' method are relevant as they handle the creation of test databases and migration application during tests, which is the situation where the issue is observed to occur. These code spans provide a comprehensive view of the potential areas where the issue might be manifesting.",

The 'django/db/utils.py' file includes the 'ConnectionRouter' class with the 'allow_migrate' method, which is central to the issue of migration rules enforcement. 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' file has the 'MigrationExecutor' class that uses 'MigrationRecorder', linking the execution of migrations to the recorder's functionality.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
