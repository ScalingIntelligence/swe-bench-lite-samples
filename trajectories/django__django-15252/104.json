The user expects that tables should not be created on any connection other than the 'default' connection when using the provided router. This involves looking into the MigrationRecorder class and related methods such as `record_applied`, `ensure_schema`, and `applied_migrations` to ensure they respect the database router's rules. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class and its methods like `apply_migration` and `record_migration` should be checked, as they interact with the MigrationRecorder. The `ConnectionRouter` class and its `allow_migrate` method are central to the router's functionality and should also be part of the investigation. Finally, the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class and its `_create_test_db` method, which is used during the setup of test databases, should be examined to ensure they respect the router settings.",

The issue specifically points out problems with the MigrationRecorder class in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, particularly how it handles schema creation and recording of applied migrations across different databases. The analysis of the search results reveals key relevant code spans:\n\n1. **MigrationRecorder Class and Methods** - This is the core class mentioned in the issue, responsible for recording migrations and ensuring schema. Relevant spans include:\n   - `MigrationRecorder.Migration` - Defines the Migration model used for recording.\n   - `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema` - Checks and creates the migration schema if it doesn't exist, which directly relates to the reported problem about schema creation on non-'default' databases.\n   - `MigrationRecorder.record_applied` - Records applied migrations and calls `ensure_schema`, reflecting the core functionality under scrutiny.\n\n2. **ConnectionRouter Class** - Although not directly mentioned in the issue, this class is relevant as it pertains to the routing of database operations based on the custom router rules. The `allow_migrate` method in this class decides whether to proceed with migration for a given database based on the routers. Analyzing this code is crucial to understand the interplay between the router rules and the actual migration execution.\n\n3. **BaseDatabaseCreation Class** - This class contains logic related to database creation, particularly for test databases, which is indirectly relevant to the issue as migrations are applied during the test setup. It's useful for understanding the broader context of when and how migrations are executed in different scenarios.\n\nThese sections of code are crucial to address the stated issue as they cover the core functionality of migration recording and database routing, which are central to the issue's description. The task is not complete as further investigation into how these components interact and possibly incorporate the db router logic might be necessary.",

Similarly, the ConnectionRouter class is presented with its allow_migrate method, but without the context of how it might be called within the execution of a migration.

The provided search results contain relevant code spans that are directly related to the reported issue. The MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py contains methods that interact with the MigrationRecorder, particularly the apply_migration method which calls record_applied.

The current context identified several key areas in the codebase relevant to this issue: the MigrationRecorder class and its methods (ensure_schema, record_applied), and the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method. The new search results provided additional context around the MigrationExecutor class, particularly the migration_plan and migrate methods, which orchestrate the migration process and interact with the MigrationRecorder. This additional context helps in understanding how the migrations are planned and executed, which is crucial for addressing the issue around respecting the db_router's rules.

This directly relates to the issue of ensuring that migrations are not created on databases that should not be migrated. The `ConnectionRouter` class from `django/db/utils.py` has an `allow_migrate` method that is responsible for enforcing database routing rules, including those that prevent migrations on non-default databases. The `BaseDatabaseCreation` class from `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` handles the creation of test databases, which is relevant to testing the migration process. Finally, the `MigrationExecutor` class from `django/db/migrations/executor.py` orchestrates the application of migrations and interacts with the `MigrationRecorder`.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
