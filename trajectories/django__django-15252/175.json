The expected behavior is for migrations to only affect the 'default' database, but currently, they are being applied to all databases, which includes trying to create tables on non-'default' databases. This behavior is traced to the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method that attempts to create tables without checking the router's allow_migrate rules. The relevant components to investigate are the MigrationRecorder, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration method, and the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method. We should focus on these areas to ensure that the router's rules are respected during migrations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the 'MigrationRecorder' in Django not obeying the 'allow_migrate' rules of the 'db_router'. The issue specifically mentions that the 'MigrationRecorder' should not create tables on non-'default' connections when a router is provided. To address this, we need to focus on how 'MigrationRecorder' interacts with the database and how it checks and creates tables.\n\n1. **MigrationLoader Class**: This class is involved in loading migrations and constructs the migration graph. It imports 'MigrationRecorder' and sets up a connection. It's relevant because it initializes the recorder with a database connection.\n\n2. **MigrationWriter Class**: This class is responsible for writing migrations to files, but its relevance to the issue isn't immediately clear except through its interaction with 'MigrationLoader'.\n\n3. **ConnectionRouter Class**: This class is crucial for the issue as it defines the logic for database routing, including the 'allow_migrate' method. The implementation of this method is essential for understanding how the router determines where migrations should be applied.\n\n4. **MigrationRecorder Class**: This class is central to the issue as it records and checks the status of migrations in the database. The methods 'ensure_schema', 'has_table', 'applied_migrations', and 'record_applied' directly relate to how the recorder interacts with the database schema, which is a key concern of the issue.\n\n5. **MigrationExecutor Class**: This class executes the migration plan. The 'apply_migration' method, which calls 'self.recorder.record_applied', is relevant because it records the applied status of migrations, and this process should adhere to the 'allow_migrate' rules.\n\nBased on these observations, several sections of the code need to be considered for relevance to the reported issue. Specifically, the methods in 'MigrationRecorder' that handle schema checks and the recording of applied migrations need to be carefully reviewed to ensure they correctly follow the 'allow_migrate' rules from the router.",

The key problem is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's allow_migrate rules, leading to the creation of the 'django_migrations' table in non-'default' databases. This behavior is unexpected as the router should dictate whether a migration is allowed on a specific database. The relevant code spans are related to the initialization and methods of the MigrationRecorder class, particularly the `ensure_schema`, `has_table`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` methods. Additionally, the ConnectionRouter's `allow_migrate` method is relevant as it defines the behavior that the MigrationRecorder should follow but currently does not. The provided search results include the necessary code spans that show how the MigrationRecorder checks and ensures the schema, records migrations, and interacts with the database. These spans are sufficient to understand the current behavior and identify the points where adjustments are needed to align with the database router's rules.",

The relevant parts of the codebase seem to be the methods in the MigrationRecorder class that handle the creation and management of the migration table, particularly the ensure_schema method. It is crucial to identify and ensure that these methods respect the db_router rules before performing actions on the database. From the provided search results, the following code spans are relevant:\n\n1. The MigrationRecorder class and its methods (ensure_schema, record_applied, record_unapplied) in django/db/migrations/recorder.py.\n2. The ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method in django/db/utils.py, as it is responsible for applying the database routing rules.\n3. The MigrationLoader class in django/db/migrations/loader.py, which is involved in loading migrations and could be relevant in understanding the broader context of migration application.\n\nThese code spans should provide a sufficient context to understand and address the issue reported concerning the MigrationRecorder not obeying db_router rules.",

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
