The main focus should be on the MigrationRecorder class and related methods like ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied. The ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method should also be considered, as it determines whether a model can be migrated to a particular database. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its apply_migration method, where the self.recorder.record_applied is called, are key points. The BaseDatabaseCreation class and its _create_test_db method, which triggers migrations during test setup, should be examined for proper handling of db_router settings.",

This aligns with the relevant code snippets provided in the search results, particularly in the following files:\n\n1. `django/db/migrations/executor.py` - This file contains the `MigrationExecutor` class which is responsible for executing migrations. The method `apply_migration` directly involves the `MigrationRecorder` to record applied migrations, which is critical to the reported issue.\n\n2. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` - This file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class. The `ensure_schema` method, which checks if the Migration model is in the tables of the connection and creates it if not found, is at the core of the issue. This method is called in `record_applied`, which records that a migration has been applied, a key process in the reported issue.\n\n3. `django/db/utils.py` - This file deals with database utility functions and the `ConnectionRouter` class. The `allow_migrate` method in this class is essential as it determines whether migrations are allowed on a given database. This method is referenced as a crucial part of the custom router discussed in the issue.\n\n4. `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` - This file contains the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class, which is pertinent to the setup and creation of test databases. The `_create_test_db` method is crucial as it describes the process of creating test databases, which triggers migrations and thus aligns with the multi-db migration issues reported.\n\nThese files and the identified code spans cover the essential processes in Django related to migrations and database handling, addressing the core of the reported issue regarding custom router rules not being obeyed for migrations in non-'default' databases.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
