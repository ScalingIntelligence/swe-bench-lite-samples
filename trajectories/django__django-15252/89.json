The expectation is that the Migration model table should not be created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. The key files to focus on are those related to migration execution, recording, and database connection handling. Specifically, django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/migrations/executor.py, and django/db/utils.py are crucial as they deal with recording migrations, executing migrations, and managing database connections respectively. Additionally, the allow_migrate method in the router should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior. The search should narrow down to these specific files and methods to identify where the conditional checks for the db_router may be missing or incorrect.",

This integration is crucial to ensure that the migration operations respect the allow_migrate rules defined in the router. Specifically, methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and the migrate method in MigrationExecutor should incorporate checks for router.allow_migrate. This would ensure that the table for the Migration model is only created on the 'default' connection and not on other connections. Additionally, the apply_migration method in MigrationExecutor should ensure that migrations are only recorded as applied if they are allowed by the router. This comprehensive integration should be the focus of the next search and analysis phase.",

The MigrationRecorder class is responsible for recording the status of migrations (whether they have been applied or not) and ensuring the schema for recording these migrations exists. The MigrationExecutor class handles the actual execution of migrations, applying or undoing them as needed. A common thread in reviewing these classes is that they directly interact with the database schema without always checking the db_router's allow_migrate method, potentially leading to issues such as creating tables on non-'default' connections. This discrepancy needs further investigation in both classes and potentially elsewhere in the codebase where migration-related decisions are made without proper consideration of the db_router settings.",

Additionally, the ConnectionRouter class in django/db/utils.py provides the allow_migrate method that is used to determine if migrations should be allowed on a database. These methods and their interactions are central to resolving the reported issue, ensuring that migrations are only applied to databases where it is permitted by the router's rules.",

A common thread in reviewing these classes is that they directly interact with the database schema without always checking the db_router's allow_migrate method, potentially leading to issues such as creating tables on non-'default' connections. This discrepancy needs further investigation in both classes and potentially elsewhere in the codebase where migration-related decisions are made without proper consideration of the db_router settings.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
