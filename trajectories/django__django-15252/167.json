The expected behavior is that migrations should only be recorded on the 'default' database, but it seems that the MigrationRecorder is attempting to create tables on other databases as well. The provided context includes several key files that might be responsible for this behavior. To address this, I will focus on the MigrationRecorder class and the allow_migrate method in the ConnectionRouter class, ensuring that the search is specific to these areas to identify the exact code causing the issue.",

The main concern is that the `MigrationRecorder` should not create tables on connections other than the 'default'. The search results provide detailed code spans from three files: `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, `django/db/utils.py`, and `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. The relevant code spans in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` include the `ensure_schema` method, which checks if the `Migration` model table exists and tries to create it if it doesn't. This behavior is problematic if the current connection is not 'default', as per the reported issue. Additionally, the `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` methods also call `ensure_schema`, which implies similar issues. In `django/db/utils.py`, the `ConnectionRouter` class and its `allow_migrate` method are relevant, as they manage the routing logic for migrations. However, the integration between the `ConnectionRouter` and the `MigrationRecorder` is not evident in the provided code spans. In `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `MigrationExecutor` class and its methods primarily handle the execution of migrations, including the `apply_migration` method that calls `self.recorder.record_applied`. This highlights the interaction point where the `MigrationRecorder`'s behavior aligns with the reported issue. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of where the issue might lie, specifically focusing on how the `MigrationRecorder` interacts with the database schema and how the `allow_migrate` rules from `ConnectionRouter` might not be properly obeyed.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
