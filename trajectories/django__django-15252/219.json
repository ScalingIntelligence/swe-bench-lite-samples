The core problem is that the MigrationRecorder creates tables on connections other than the 'default' connection, even when a db_router is configured to disallow this. This violates the expected behavior of the router. To address this, we need to locate the methods and logic in the MigrationRecorder class that handle table creation and migration recording. We should also check the executor to see how it interacts with the MigrationRecorder and applies migrations. We should ensure that the class names and function names are accurately specified to narrow down the search to relevant parts of the codebase.",

This means that the `django_migrations` table should only be created in the 'default' database and not in any other databases defined with `managed = False`. The key functions to focus on are `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `applied_migrations` in the `MigrationRecorder` class. It's also important to note the `create_test_db` function in `BaseDatabaseCreation` as it sets up the test databases and runs the migrate command. Additionally, the `allow_migrate` method in `ConnectionRouter` is crucial as it dictates which databases are allowed to run migrations. This method should be integrated into the `MigrationRecorder` logic to prevent the creation of the `django_migrations` table in non-default databases.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
