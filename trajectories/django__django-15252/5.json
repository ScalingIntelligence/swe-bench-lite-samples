The concern is that tables for migrations are being created on databases other than the 'default' one, despite the router configuration. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods, particularly 'ensure_schema' and 'record_applied'. Additionally, we should check the MigrationExecutor's 'apply_migration' method where the recorder is used. It's also crucial to look into how the test databases are being set up and migrations applied during testing.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the MigrationRecorder class in Django's migration system when dealing with a multi-db setup and a custom router. Specifically, it highlights that the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules, potentially leading to the creation of the django_migrations table in non-default databases. This issue is significant because it violates the intended behavior of the custom router, which should restrict database operations to the 'default' connection only. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the creation and recording of migrations, especially those that interact with the database router. \n\nThe provided file context and search results contain several key spans in the `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` and `django/db/migrations/executor.py` files. These spans include the `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `apply_migration` methods, which are central to the issue at hand. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class and its methods `__init__` and `_create_project_state` are relevant as they initialize and interact with the `MigrationRecorder`. \n\nTo ensure completeness, we also analyze the `MigrationRecorder.Migration` class property and the initialization of the `MigrationExecutor`. These spans are crucial for understanding how the `MigrationRecorder` and `MigrationExecutor` are set up and used within the migration process. By carefully reviewing these spans, we can identify the parts of the code that need to be modified or extended to respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
