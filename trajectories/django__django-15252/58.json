The key areas to investigate are the MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and ConnectionRouter classes. These classes handle the recording of migrations, the execution of migrations, and the routing of database operations respectively. Specifically, attention should be paid to the record_applied method in MigrationRecorder, the apply_migration method in MigrationExecutor, and the allow_migrate method in ConnectionRouter. The goal is to identify code where the migration recording or application logic might not be respecting the database routing settings.",

This leads to the creation of the 'django_migrations' table in non-'default' databases, which is undesirable.

By examining the code, we can pinpoint the methods responsible for these actions and determine if they appropriately adhere to the database router's decisions. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class, which uses the MigrationRecorder, should also be reviewed to ensure that it respects the router's decisions when applying or unapplying migrations.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
