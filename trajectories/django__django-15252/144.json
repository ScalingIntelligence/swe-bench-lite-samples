Specifically, the issue lies in the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder class, which checks for the existence of the Migration table and creates it if it does not exist, without consulting the db router to determine if this action is allowed. This is evident in the has_table method of the MigrationRecorder class, where it directly checks for the table in the current connection without considering the router's allow_migrate rule. The issue impacts the record_applied method, which calls ensure_schema before recording a migration, suggesting that similar issues may exist in applied_migrations and record_unapplied methods as well. Furthermore, the MigrationExecutor class uses the MigrationRecorder and is involved in applying migrations, which could potentially lead to the creation of tables in databases where it should not occur, based on the provided router rules. The ConnectionRouter class, responsible for handling database routing decisions, seems relevant as it includes the allow_migrate method that should be consulted during the migration process.",

The MigrationRecorder's methods ensure_schema and record_applied are particularly relevant as they deal with schema checks and recording of applied migrations. The MigrationExecutor's apply_migration and record_migration methods show how migrations are applied and recorded, indicating that the relevant code for taking action based on db_routers (like checking allow_migrate rules) should be integrated here. The ConnectionRouter class handles the routing logic but does not directly interact with the MigrationRecorder or MigrationExecutor in the provided context. However, it sets up the necessary foundation for the db_router logic to be applied. Given the provided context, it seems that the relevant parts of the codebase are identified, but the actual implementation of checking and obeying the db_router's allow_migrate rules within the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes is not fully shown.

The provided search results and file context contain several relevant code spans that directly relate to the migration recording and execution process.

Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods (like apply_migration and record_migration) interact closely with the MigrationRecorder and should also be examined for any places where the router rules might be overlooked. The search results include the crucial code spans needed to fully understand and potentially address the issue, ensuring that migrations are only recorded and applied to databases where they are allowed.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
