The user expects that the migrations should only be applied to the 'default' database as per the router's allow_migrate rules. However, the current implementation of MigrationRecorder does not respect these rules and attempts to create the migration table on all connections, which is incorrect behavior.\n\nI analyzed the search results and identified several relevant code spans:\n\n1. In django/db/migrations/recorder.py, the MigrationRecorder class definition and its methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations are relevant. These methods directly deal with the recording and schema management of migrations.\n\n2. In django/db/utils.py, the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method are relevant as they encapsulate the routing logic specified in the router.\n\n3. In django/db/backends/base/creation.py, the BaseDatabaseCreation class and its create_test_db method are relevant because this is where the test database creation and migration application logic reside.\n\nThese code spans are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
