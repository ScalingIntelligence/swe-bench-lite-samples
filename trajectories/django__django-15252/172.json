The key points from the issue are: 1. The MigrationRecorder should respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules. 2. The 'ensure_schema' method in MigrationRecorder should not create tables on non-'default' databases. 3. Similar issues might exist with 'applied_migrations' and 'record_unapplied'. The provided search results contain relevant code spans in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py'. Specifically, the 'ensure_schema' method in MigrationRecorder directly relates to the reported issue as it is responsible for table creation. Additionally, the 'apply_migration' method in MigrationExecutor calls 'record_applied', which in turn calls 'ensure_schema', making it another crucial point of interest. Based on this analysis, I have identified the following code spans as relevant to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
