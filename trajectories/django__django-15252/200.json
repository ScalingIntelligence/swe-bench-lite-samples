Specifically, it concerns the creation of the django_migrations table on databases other than the 'default'. I analyzed three files from the search results: django/db/migrations/recorder.py, django/db/utils.py, and django/db/migrations/executor.py.\n\nIn django/db/migrations/recorder.py, the MigrationRecorder class and its methods ensure_schema, applied_migrations, and record_applied, are crucial as they deal directly with creating and recording migrations. The ensure_schema method, which checks if the Migration table exists and, if not, tries to create it, is potentially the source of the issue. This method lacks any check against the db_router's allow_migrate rules before attempting to create the table.\n\nIn django/db/utils.py, the ConnectionRouter class and its methods allow_migrate and allow_migrate_model determine whether a migration is allowed on a specific database. This shows how the router should be used to decide on database operations but is not integrated in the MigrationRecorder.\n\nIn django/db/migrations/executor.py, the MigrationExecutor class handles the execution of migrations including their recording. The methods apply_migration and record_migration in particular interact closely with the MigrationRecorder, suggesting that any changes to respect the db_router's rules would need to be implemented not just in the recorder but also in the executor to ensure consistency across all stages of migration handling.\n\nGiven these findings, I identified relevant code spans in django/db/migrations/recorder.py and django/db/migrations/executor.py for further investigation and potential modification to respect the db_router's rules.",

Given the complexity and the crucial role of MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor in the migration process, a deeper understanding of how these components interact with the database router is necessary. The focus should shift to examining the integration points between MigrationRecorder, MigrationExecutor, and the db router in more detail. This includes looking into the `__init__` method of MigrationExecutor, where it initializes the MigrationRecorder with a database connection, and the `apply_migration` method of MigrationExecutor, which directly calls the `record_applied` method of MigrationRecorder. Additionally, the `ensure_schema` method in MigrationRecorder, which is called within `record_applied`, should be scrutinized to ensure it adheres to the router's decisions. Given the pattern of results, it might be beneficial to expand the search to include any middleware or utility functions that could influence the behavior of these classes without explicit mention in the immediate context.",

Specifically, it suggests that the MigrationRecorder should respect the allow_migrate rules defined in a custom router to ensure that migration tables are only created in the 'default' database and not in other databases. The current implementation of MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema does not check the allow_migrate rule before attempting to create the migration table, which leads to incorrect table creation on non-'default' databases. \n\nReviewing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in both 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' and 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py'. The executor's apply_migration method extensively uses the MigrationRecorder, particularly the record_applied method which triggers the ensure_schema method. The ensure_schema method directly attempts to create a table without considering the database routing rules that should be enforced by the allow_migrate method. \n\nAdditionally, the 'django/db/utils.py' file contains the ConnectionRouter class, which is responsible for managing database routing and includes the allow_migrate method. Even though this file is not directly involved in the issue, understanding how the router works is crucial for resolving the problem. \n\nTo address the issue, modifications are required in the ensure_schema function within 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' to incorporate a check against the allow_migrate rules before creating the table. This would ensure that the table is only created in the database permitted by the router, thereby obeying the allow_migrate rules.",

The MigrationExecutor initializes a MigrationRecorder object, but there's no immediate indication that it verifies the `allow_migrate` status before proceeding with applying and recording migrations. The `apply_migration` method in MigrationExecutor handles the application of migration but lacks a direct enforcement of the router's decision at the point where the schema is ensured and recorded.

The current search results and file context provide crucial insights into how the MigrationRecorder and related classes are implemented, particularly the ensure_schema method, which checks for the existence of the Migration model in the tables of the connection. If the table does not exist, it attempts to create it. The relevant code spans identified from the search results and file context include the MigrationRecorder class, specifically its ensure_schema method, and the MigrationExecutor class, particularly the apply_migration and record_migration methods. These methods interact directly with the database and the MigrationRecorder, making them key to understanding and potentially resolving the issue. The ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method are also significant, as they define the rules that should be enforced to respect the db_router configurations. Overall, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of the Django codebase that could be contributing to the reported issue.",

This is a critical gap as it undermines the intended routing behavior that should direct migrations to specific databases. The MigrationExecutor initializes a MigrationRecorder object, but there's no immediate indication that it verifies the `allow_migrate` status before proceeding with applying and recording migrations. The `apply_migration` method in MigrationExecutor handles the application of migration but lacks a direct enforcement of the router's decision at the point where the schema is ensured and recorded. This oversight is consistent with the reported issue where migrations are applied irrespective of the router's configuration. To address this, modifications would be needed within the MigrationExecutor and MigrationRecorder to introduce the necessary checks against the ConnectionRouter's `allow_migrate` method before executing operations that modify the database schema.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
