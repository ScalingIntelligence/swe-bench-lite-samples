The user expects that tables should not be created in non-'default' connections when a router is provided, but the MigrationRecorder seems to be creating tables in these connections. To address this, we need to locate the relevant parts of the code where the MigrationRecorder interacts with the db_router and the database connections, focusing on the methods that handle schema creation and migration application. The search should target files and methods related to these processes.",

The primary concern is that the MigrationRecorder class should not create tables in databases other than the 'default' one, as specified by the router's allow_migrate method. The relevant sections of code are found in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py', which contains the MigrationRecorder class with methods such as 'ensure_schema', 'record_applied', and 'record_unapplied'. These methods directly interact with the database schemas and migration records. Additionally, 'django/db/backends/base/creation.py' provides context on how test databases are created and migrations are applied during tests, which is relevant to the issue of overriding the db_router rules. Lastly, 'django/db/utils.py' includes the ConnectionRouter class, which manages the routing of database operations according to the configured routers, including the allow_migrate method that the issue is focused on.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
