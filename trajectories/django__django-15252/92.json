The specific problem is that the MigrationRecorder does not respect the router's allow_migrate rules, leading to the creation of tables in databases that should not have them. The main areas of concern are the methods within MigrationRecorder that deal with schema ensuring and migration recording, such as ensure_schema(), record_applied(), and applied_migrations(). Additionally, the behavior of MigrationExecutor and its method apply_migration() should be checked for proper interaction with the custom router. It's also important to review the database creation and migration application processes in the context of test environments, where setup_databases and create_test_db might influence the situation. Given the identified files and their contents, focusing on the methods mentioned within those files should help pinpoint the problematic behavior.",

These files contain key classes and methods related to migration execution, recording, and database creation during tests.

'executor.py' and 'recorder.py' contain the MigrationExecutor and MigrationRecorder classes, respectively, which are central to the migration process and the recording of applied migrations. 'creation.py' is significant because it deals with the creation of test databases, which are directly implicated in the scenario described.

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
