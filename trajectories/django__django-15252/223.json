The MigrationRecorder should not create tables on connections other than 'default' when a router is provided. The key areas to investigate are the MigrationRecorder class, particularly methods like ensure_schema and record_applied, and the interaction with the MigrationExecutor and ConnectionRouter classes. The initial focus should be on the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor files.",

The main concern is that the `ensure_schema` method of `MigrationRecorder` tries to create the `django_migrations` table on all databases, not just 'default', which contradicts the router's rules.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code, several key spans are relevant:\n1. The `ensure_schema` method in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, which checks if the `django_migrations` table exists and attempts to create it if it doesn't. This is directly responsible for the table creation behavior mentioned in the issue.\n2. The `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` methods, which call `ensure_schema`, indicating that these methods could also be contributing to the issue by attempting to create the table on non-'default' databases.\n3. The `apply_migration` method in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, which calls `self.recorder.record_applied`, linking the migration application process to the behavior of `MigrationRecorder`.\n\nThese code spans are directly related to the issue of table creation across databases and the methods involved in recording applied and unapplied migrations. They should be considered in any patch or adjustment to ensure the `MigrationRecorder` respects the database routing settings.",

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
