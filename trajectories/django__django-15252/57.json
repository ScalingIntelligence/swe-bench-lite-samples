Specifically, the MigrationRecorder does not respect the db_router's allow_migrate rules. The Router class is designed to allow migrations only on the 'default' database, but the MigrationRecorder attempts to create tables on other databases regardless. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code sections within the MigrationRecorder and the MigrationExecutor to understand how the migration recording and application process interacts with the database router. We will also look at the specific methods used in these interactions.",

Specifically, the issue is that the MigrationRecorder is not respecting the router's allow_migrate rules and is creating the 'django_migrations' table in databases other than the 'default' one. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that involve the creation and management of the 'django_migrations' table and the related methods that interact with the router's allow_migrate rules.\n\nAnalysis of the provided code spans:\n1. In `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, the `MigrationRecorder` class is responsible for recording the applied migrations, ensuring the schema, and handling the 'django_migrations' table. The methods `ensure_schema`, `applied_migrations`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` are critical as they interact with the table and need to respect the db_router rules.\n2. The `django/db/migrations/executor.py` file contains the `MigrationExecutor` class, which uses the `MigrationRecorder` to record migration applications and removals. The methods `record_migration` and `unapply_migration` call the `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` methods of the `MigrationRecorder`, respectively.\n3. The `django/db/utils.py` file includes the `ConnectionRouter` class, which implements the `allow_migrate` method to determine whether a model can be migrated to a particular database.\n\nGiven the issue, the relevant code spans are those that involve the `MigrationRecorder`'s methods that interact with the database schema and the migration records, and the parts of the `ConnectionRouter` that enforce the migration rules.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
