I analyzed the search results and found relevant code spans in the 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' files. Specifically, the 'ensure_schema' method in 'MigrationRecorder' checks if the Migration model is in the tables and attempts to create the table if it is not found. This behavior needs to be adjusted to consider the db_router rules. Additionally, the 'apply_migration' method in 'MigrationExecutor' calls 'record_applied', which also interacts with the db_router rules. The issue suggests that the table should not be created on connections other than the 'default' connection if a router is provided, but the current code does not respect this rule. To address this, modifications should be made to ensure that the db_router's allow_migrate rules are consulted before creating tables in the 'ensure_schema' method and other relevant methods.",

The current implementation of MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema() does not respect these rules, leading to the creation of the django_migrations table in databases other than 'default'. The relevant sections of code include the MigrationRecorder class, particularly the ensure_schema method which is responsible for creating the migration table if it doesn't exist. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class is important as it interacts closely with MigrationRecorder. In terms of new search results, the ConnectionRouter class is relevant as it handles the routing logic defined in the router, including the allow_migrate method. This suggests that the MigrationRecorder should be checking the allow_migrate rule before attempting to create the table. Integrating this check would ensure that tables are only created in permitted databases, resolving the issue.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
