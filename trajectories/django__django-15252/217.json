Specifically, the complaint is that MigrationRecorder is not obeying the allow_migrate rule that dictates tables should only be created on the 'default' database connection. This issue is crucial for maintaining a multi-db setup where only specific databases should be subject to Django migrations. From the file context, we see that the MigrationRecorder class is defined in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' and the ConnectionRouter class in 'django/db/utils.py'. The provided search results complete the picture by including the 'allow_migrate' method within the ConnectionRouter class, which is key to understanding how migration permissions are managed across databases.\n\nGiven these details, it's clear that the primary concern lies with the MigrationRecorder's behavior, particularly in relation to the ensure_schema method which checks for and potentially creates the 'Migration' table. The search results provide the crucial method used by the router to decide migration permissions (i.e., ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate). This method iterates over configured routers to determine if a migration should be allowed on a given database. However, the MigrationRecorder class does not appear to consult this method before deciding to create the 'Migration' table, leading to the observed behavior of table creation on unintended databases.\n\nConsidering the requirements, the identified 'allow_migrate' method in the ConnectionRouter class is relevant as it shows how the router is supposed to handle migration allowance. However, the core issue involves the MigrationRecorder's lack of adherence to these rules. The next step would be to examine the MigrationRecorder's methods more closely to understand why it disregards the allow_migrate rule and to determine appropriate fixes or enhancements.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
