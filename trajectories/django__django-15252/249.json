The key aspects to consider are how the ensure_schema method behaves when a db_router is present and how it determines whether to create the migration table on non-'default' connections. The relevant code spans are found in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' within the MigrationRecorder class. This class contains the ensure_schema method which checks if the migration table exists and attempts to create it if it does not, without considering the db_router rules. This direct interaction with the database schema could be bypassing the intended behavior specified by the db_router. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' is relevant as it interacts with the MigrationRecorder, especially in the apply_migration method where migrations are applied and recorded. Understanding how the MigrationRecorder's interaction with the schema is managed within this context is crucial. Furthermore, the ConnectionRouter class in 'django/db/utils.py' is identified as it contains the allow_migrate method that should dictate which databases migrations are allowed on. The current implementation of ensure_schema in MigrationRecorder seems to not consult the router before attempting to create the migration table, which is a mismatch with the expected behavior described in the issue.",

The ensure_schema method therein is responsible for creating the migration table, but it does so without considering the db_router rules. This behavior is precisely what the issue describes as problematic. Furthermore, the record_applied method also calls ensure_schema, indicating that similar issues might arise when recording applied migrations. The MigrationExecutor class in django/db/migrations/executor.py uses MigrationRecorder and interacts with it directly during the migration process, confirming the relevance of MigrationRecorder to the issue at hand. However, the file context is missing the implementation of the db_router itself or specific instances where the db_router's allow_migrate rules are consulted or enforced within the MigrationRecorder or MigrationExecutor classes.

Specifically, the `ensure_schema` method in the MigrationRecorder class attempts to create a table if it does not exist, which should be checked against the router's allow_migrate rule. Additionally, the `apply_migration` method in the MigrationExecutor class also interacts with the MigrationRecorder, yet it does not appear to check the router's allow_migrate rule before proceeding with the migration. Other methods like `record_applied` and `applied_migrations` in the MigrationRecorder class are also relevant as they influence the application of migrations.

The current context provided in the file_context clearly shows the relevant parts of the codebase where the MigrationRecorder is defined and how it interacts with the migrations. The search results provide additional context relating to the MigrationExecutor and how migrations are applied, as well as the ConnectionRouter responsible for routing database operations based on certain rules. Specifically, the MigrationExecutor's apply_migration method and the ConnectionRouter's allow_migrate method are critical for understanding how migrations are applied and how the router decides which migrations to allow. The issue seems to center around the ensure_schema method in MigrationRecorder, which creates the migration table without checking the router's allow_migrate rules. This suggests refactoring ensure_schema to respect the router before attempting to create the table could resolve the issue. Given the significant overlap with the reported issue, I believe the search results are relevant and complete.",

The `ensure_schema` method in `MigrationRecorder` checks if the `django_migrations` table exists and creates it if it does not. This method does not directly consult the `allow_migrate` method from the database router. However, the `MigrationExecutor` class, which manages the application of migrations, utilizes the `MigrationRecorder`. The `apply_migration` method in `MigrationExecutor` uses the `record_migration` method, which in turn uses `MigrationRecorder.record_applied`. This chain of operations suggests that the decision to create or check for the `django_migrations` table might be indirectly influenced by the database router through the `apply_migration` method. For a more comprehensive understanding, it is crucial to examine how the `apply_migration` method handles database routing and how it integrates with `MigrationRecorder` methods.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
