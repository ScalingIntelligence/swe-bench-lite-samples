Specifically, the MigrationRecorder tries to create the 'django_migrations' table on databases other than the 'default' one, which violates the router's intent. To resolve this, it's crucial to ensure that all operations within the MigrationRecorder, such as ensure_schema and record_applied, strictly adhere to the allow_migrate rules. The provided search results are relevant as they contain the core components affected by this issue: the MigrationExecutor class managing the migration execution and the apply_migration method within it, which directly calls self.recorder.record_applied. This method is critical because it triggers the schema creation if the Migration table doesn't exist, which leads to the observed behavior. By ensuring that the conditions for schema creation and migration recording strictly follow the router's rules, the issue can be addressed. The provided code spans are relevant because they involve the direct interaction with the database and the recording of migrations, which are central to the reported problem.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
