The key files to investigate are those related to the migration process and database handling, such as executor.py, recorder.py, and utils.py. Focusing on methods like apply_migration, record_applied, and allow_migrate will be crucial for identifying where the adherence to db_router rules might be failing.",

The issue specifically mentions the functions `record_applied`, `ensure_schema`, and the router's `allow_migrate` method. We should focus on these areas to ensure we capture all relevant code for understanding and resolving the issue. From the search results, we have identified several key spans in different files. In `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, the `apply_migration` method calls `record_migration`, which is relevant to the recording of migrations. In `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`, the `record_applied` method and its call to `ensure_schema` are directly involved in the process of recording applied migrations and ensuring the schema, which should be checked for compliance with the router's rules on which database to create schema on. The `django/db/utils.py` file contains the `ConnectionRouter` class, which includes methods like `allow_migrate`, `allow_migrate_model`, and router properties that define how to route database operations, such as migrations. This is crucial for understanding how the router system works and how it should influence migration operations. The `django/db/models/options.py` file includes the `can_migrate` method within the `Options` class, which determines whether a given model should be migrated for a specific connection, which is also relevant for the router's behavior in managing migrations. Overall, these spans provide a comprehensive look at how migrations are executed, recorded, and controlled in relation to the database routers, which is essential for resolving the issue described.",

The existing file context provides a deep understanding of the MigrationExecutor and the MigrationRecorder classes. The new search results specifically show the 'ensure_schema' method in MigrationRecorder, which is central to the issue as it deals with creating the migration table. This method should ideally respect the 'allow_migrate' rules set by the router to prevent table creation on non-'default' databases. Given the information, it's clear that the current implementation of 'ensure_schema' does not consult the router, leading to the reported behavior where tables are created on non-'default' databases.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
