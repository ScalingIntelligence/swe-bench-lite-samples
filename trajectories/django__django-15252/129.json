Specifically, it should not create tables in non-'default' databases when a router is in place that restricts table creation to the 'default' database. The key steps in the analysis are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant parts of the code that handle the creation and recording of migrations**: This includes the `MigrationRecorder` class, particularly its methods like `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied`. These methods are responsible for ensuring the schema exists and recording whether a migration has been applied or unapplied.\n\n2. **Review the logic in these methods to see if they honor the router's allow_migrate rules**: The methods, especially `ensure_schema` and `record_applied`, currently do not check the router rules before creating the schema or recording the migration. Instead, they directly interact with the database based on the connection provided.\n\n3. **Assess where the proposed changes should be applied**: To address the issue, modifications would need to be made within the `MigrationRecorder` class to consult the router's `allow_migrate` method before executing actions that create tables or record migrations. This check should be added to prevent operations on databases that are not allowed, as per the router's rules.\n\n4. **Determine if there are related parts of the codebase that might also need adjustment**: Given the interconnected nature of migration execution and recording, it's also crucial to look at how `MigrationExecutor` and other parts of the system interact with `MigrationRecorder`. Specifically, `MigrationExecutor`'s methods like `apply_migration` and `migrate` also need to align with the rules set by the router.\n\n5. **Consider the broader implications and potential edge cases**: Implementing such changes could potentially affect other parts of the system that assume unrestricted access based on connection settings. Thorough testing would be necessary to ensure that functionality is not inadvertently impaired.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the relevant code spans identified are from the `MigrationRecorder` class, which is central to the issue at hand. These spans address the creation of the migration table schema and the recording of applied and unapplied migrations.",

The primary concern is that the Migration model should not be created in databases other than the 'default' one when a router is in place to manage such migrations.\n\nFrom the file context, it's clear that the MigrationRecorder has methods to ensure schema and record migrations, but there's no explicit check against the router's allow_migrate rules before creating these schemas or recording migrations.\n\nIn the new search results, the MigrationExecutor class is a significant find. This class handles the actual execution of migrations, including calling the MigrationRecorder's methods. It's noteworthy that the MigrationExecutor's migrate method directly calls self.recorder.ensure_schema() without any checks for the router's rules. Additionally, the apply_migration method also directly calls self.record_migration, which might lead to inconsistencies if the migration is not allowed by the router.\n\nThe ConnectionRouter class is also relevant as it contains the logic for routing database operations based on the router settings. Especially the allow_migrate method is directly tied to the issue reported, as it defines which migrations are allowed on which databases. However, it appears that the methods in MigrationExecutor are not referencing or checking this allow_migrate method before executing migrations or ensuring schemas.\n\nGiven these findings, it seems that the current implementation might not be honoring the router rules at crucial points like ensuring schema and recording migrations. Therefore, the identified spans from both django/db/migrations/executor.py and django/db/utils.py are relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the issue.",

To address this issue, it is crucial to identify the relevant code spans that facilitate the migration process, specifically focusing on the `MigrationExecutor` and `MigrationRecorder` classes. The provided file context already includes key methods from these classes such as `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` from `MigrationRecorder`, and `apply_migration` and `record_migration` from `MigrationExecutor`. These methods are central to recording and applying migrations, and it is evident from the issue description that they do not currently respect the `allow_migrate` setting. The search results augment the context by providing additional methods in `MigrationExecutor` such as `migration_plan`, `migrate`, `_migrate_all_forwards`, and `_migrate_all_backwards`, which further detail the migration execution process and confirm the direct involvement of `MigrationRecorder` in recording the state of migrations. The `ConnectionRouter` class from django/db/utils.py, also present in the context, handles the routing logic for database operations including migration, which needs to be integrated with the migration recording process to ensure compliance with the router's rules. Collectively, these code spans exhibit the necessary components for a comprehensive solution where the `MigrationExecutor` and `MigrationRecorder` correctly respect the `allow_migrate` rules during the migration process.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
