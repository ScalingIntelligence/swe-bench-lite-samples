Specifically, there's a requirement that tables are only created on the 'default' database connection, as per the `Router` class logic. The process involves checking the `MigrationRecorder` class's `ensure_schema` method, which is responsible for schema existence checks. Also, other methods like `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` might have similar behavior not constrained by the router. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor`'s `apply_migration` method calls `self.recorder.record_applied`, which initiates the problematic schema check. Furthermore, the `ConnectionRouter`'s `allow_migrate` method and the `_create_test_db` method in `BaseDatabaseCreation` might be places where the router's instructions are not being fully adhered to.",

The key concerns are that the MigrationRecorder should not attempt to create the django_migrations table on databases other than the 'default' one, as specified by the router. The relevant code spans provided include the ensure_schema method of the MigrationRecorder class, which checks for the existence of the django_migrations table and creates it if it does not exist. This method is called by record_applied and record_unapplied, which are used to record whether a migration has been applied or unapplied, respectively. Additionally, the MigrationExecutor class and its methods, such as apply_migration and record_migration, interact with the MigrationRecorder. These methods are crucial as they orchestrate the application of migrations and the recording of their status. The ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method are also relevant, as they define the routing logic that should be obeyed by the MigrationRecorder. Finally, the BaseDatabaseCreation class and its _create_test_db method are important because they handle the creation of test databases, which involves running migrations and thus interacting with the MigrationRecorder. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the reported issue.",

Specifically, the `MigrationRecorder` class in 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' includes methods `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied`, which directly address the concern of schema management and migration recording without considering the `db_router`. This matches the expectation that the reported issue relates to the `MigrationRecorder` not respecting `db_router` rules. Additionally, the `MigrationExecutor` class in 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' uses `MigrationRecorder`, further supporting the relevance. However, the file context lacks explicit checks in these methods to confirm compliance with the `allow_migrate` rules from the `Router` class, indicating a potential lack of integration with the router logic, as suspected in the issue. The 'django/db/utils.py' file context includes the `ConnectionRouter` defining `allow_migrate`, which was also mentioned in the issue, pointing towards the API used for checking database routing rules but not how this routing is enforced in the `MigrationRecorder`.",

This is particularly evident in the `ensure_schema` method of `MigrationRecorder`, which creates the schema for recording migrations if it does not exist. It does not appear to check if the current database operation is allowed according to a provided router. Similarly, methods like `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` in `MigrationRecorder` also call `ensure_schema` without checking the `allow_migrate` logic beforehand. In `MigrationExecutor`, the `apply_migration` and `record_migration` methods directly interact with `MigrationRecorder` without verifying if the migration operation complies with the router's allowance. This oversight can lead to schema changes on databases where migrations should not be applied, as per the router's rules. Therefore, a key step to resolve this issue is to integrate checks to the `allow_migrate` method of the router or connection router before any schema operations or record adjustments in both `MigrationRecorder` and `MigrationExecutor`.",

Specifically, the issue is that the MigrationRecorder is not respecting the db_router's allow_migrate rules, leading to tables being created in non-'default' connections. This violates the expected behavior where tables should only be created in the 'default' connection. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that the MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema method attempts to create the django_migrations table if it doesn't already exist, without checking the allow_migrate rules from the router. Additionally, methods like record_applied and record_unapplied also call ensure_schema, suggesting they may also have similar issues. The MigrationExecutor class also interacts with the MigrationRecorder, potentially propagating these issues when applying or unapplying migrations. Furthermore, the ConnectionRouter class, responsible for routing decisions based on the db_router, does have a method to check allow_migrate rules, but this doesn't appear to be integrated into the MigrationRecorder's schema ensuring logic.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
