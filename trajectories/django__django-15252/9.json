Specifically, the MigrationRecorder attempts to create tables on connections other than the 'default', even though the router specifies otherwise. To address this, we need to focus on the MigrationRecorder class and its methods like ensure_schema, record_applied, and applied_migrations. We should also look into the MigrationExecutor class's apply_migration method, as it interacts closely with the MigrationRecorder. Additionally, file patterns should include any files related to migration recording, execution, or database backend creation.",

The issue describes an expectation that tables, specifically the 'django_migrations' table, should only be created in the 'default' database and not in other databases where managed=False. The code spans provided include the MigrationRecorder class and its methods such as ensure_schema, record_applied, and record_unapplied. These methods are critical as they handle the creation of the 'django_migrations' table and the recording of migrations. The code spans also include the MigrationExecutor class, which uses the MigrationRecorder to apply and record migrations, and the ConnectionRouter class, which contains the allow_migrate method used to determine whether migrations should be applied to a specific database. Based on the reported issue, the relevant code spans are those from the MigrationRecorder and MigrationExecutor classes, as they directly deal with the migration recording and application processes.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
