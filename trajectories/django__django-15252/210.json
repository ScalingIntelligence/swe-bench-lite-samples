            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves the MigrationRecorder's behavior when a database router is configured to manage migrations across multiple databases. The router's `allow_migrate` rule should determine whether migrations should be applied to a database, but the MigrationRecorder incorrectly attempts to create tables on non-'default' connections. To debug and potentially fix this, we need to examine the methods `ensure_schema`, `applied_migrations`, and `record_applied` in django/db/migrations/recorder.py, as well as the router's handling of migrations in django/db/utils.py. Additionally, the `apply_migration` method in django/db/migrations/executor.py is involved in the application of migrations and could influence how the MigrationRecorder behaves.",

The user expects that the django_migrations table should not be created on connections other than 'default' when a router is in place. Upon analyzing the provided code, the following is observed:\n\n1. **MigrationRecorder Class**: This class in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` is responsible for recording applied migrations and ensuring the schema for the migration table.\n\n2. **ensure_schema Method**: This method checks if the migration table exists and creates it if it doesn't. This method is called within `record_applied` and `record_unapplied`. This behavior, as described in the issue, doesn't respect the router's allow_migrate rules.\n\n3. **MigrationExecutor Class**: This class in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` uses the MigrationRecorder and calls `self.recorder.ensure_schema()` in the `migrate` method, which is also likely to create the table on the wrong connection.\n\n4. **ConnectionRouter Class**: The `allow_migrate` method in `django/db/utils.py` seems to be correctly implemented to return False if the database is not 'default'. However, this logic isn't integrated into the checking or creation of the migrations table.\n\nGiven the provided context, the core issue lies in the `MigrationRecorder` class's methods not consulting the router before deciding to create the migration table in a non-default database.\n\nTo address this, the relevant code spans involve the `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` methods in `MigrationRecorder` and the `migrate` method in `MigrationExecutor`, as these are crucial for handling when and where the migration table is created and manipulated.",

  "initial_message": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules\nDescription\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n"
