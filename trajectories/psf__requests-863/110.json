Specifically, if a list of hook functions is passed for a hook, the current implementation wraps it in a list, which then fails when the hooks are consumed because a list is not callable. The issue suggests that `Request.__init__()` should parse the `hooks` parameter to accept lists as its values. In the provided search results, the relevant code spans include the `Request.__init__()` method where the hooks are processed, and the `register_hook()` method where hooks are added to the `Request` object. These parts of the code handle the registration and initialization of hooks, and modifications here can address the issue of handling lists of hook functions.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
