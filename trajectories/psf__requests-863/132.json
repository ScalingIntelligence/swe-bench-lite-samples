Specifically, it points out that the current implementation of Request.__init__() fails when a list of hook functions is provided for a hook, as it wraps the list in another list, causing the list to not be callable. This issue is evident in the line 'self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)' within the Request.__init__() method. To address this, the code needs to be updated to correctly handle lists of hook functions. The relevant code spans include the entire Request.__init__() method and the register_hook() method. The Session.request() method is also relevant as it involves handling hooks. These methods need to be updated to ensure that if a list is provided for a hook, it is correctly processed and stored.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
