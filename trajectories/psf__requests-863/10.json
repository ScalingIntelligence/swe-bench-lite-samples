Currently, it only handles single hook functions, which makes it cumbersome to register multiple hooks. The analysis of the provided code reveals several key points:\n\n1. **Request.__init__**: This method initializes the Request object and parses the `hooks` argument. However, it incorrectly wraps lists in lists if provided, leading to a failure downstream. This aligns directly with the reported issue.\n2. **Request.register_hook**: Although not shown in the provided code, it's implied that this method currently exists and is used to register hooks separately after object creation. The issue suggests that accepting lists in `__init__` would simplify the process.\n3. **Session.request**: This method constructs a `Request` object and sends it. It iterates over hooks and merges them, adding context for how hooks are typically used and handled in the larger framework.\n4. **dispatch_hook**: This function dispatches hooks based on a key. It checks if the hook is callable and iterates over a list of hooks if provided.\n\nGiven these points, the most relevant code spans are those in `Request.__init__` and `dispatch_hook` as they address the direct handling of hooks. The other sections provide context, but they don't directly relate to modifying how hooks are accepted and processed during object initialization.",

Currently, the code does not properly handle such cases, causing issues when these hooks are later consumed. To address this, the code needs to be modified in the Request.__init__ method and possibly in the dispatch_hook function to correctly manage lists of hook functions. Additionally, relevant methods like register_hook may also be impacted and should be reviewed. The provided search results include the relevant sections of code that need to be modified: the Request class definition, specifically the __init__ and register_hook methods, and also touches upon the dispatch_hook function in the hooks module.

The issue relates to the hooks parameter being able to accept lists as values, which aligns with the current implementation in the **init**() method where hooks are iterated over and registered. However, there is no explicit handling for lists within these hooks, which could lead to issues if a list is passed. This suggests that the relevant code for addressing the issue exists, but there is potential for improvement to explicitly handle lists within the hooks. The context also includes the dispatch_hook function from the 'hooks' module, which dispatches hooks, supporting the idea that the file context is relevant to the issue. Given the context, it seems possible to make the necessary modifications to support lists in hooks, but there may be a need for additional validation or adjustment in the code to ensure that lists are properly handled as specified in the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, it is clear that the main problem lies in the way the `Request` object handles the `hooks` argument. Specifically, the `__init__` method of the `Request` class does not correctly handle cases where the `hooks` argument contains lists of hook functions for each event, leading to errors when these hooks are consumed. The suggested solution is to modify the `__init__` method to accept lists as values in the `hooks` parameter.\n\nGiven the current file context and the new search results, the relevant files and code spans are:\n\n1. `requests/models.py`: This file contains the `Request` class with the `__init__`, `register_hook`, and `send` methods. The `__init__` method is of particular importance as it initializes the hooks and needs to be adjusted to handle lists of hook functions.\n\n2. `requests/hooks.py`: Contains the `dispatch_hook` function, which is used to call the registered hooks. This function should handle lists of hooks correctly.\n\nRelevant spans include the `__init__` method where hooks are initialized and the `register_hook` method where hooks are registered. The `dispatch_hook` function in `hooks.py` is also relevant for understanding how hooks are currently being called.\n\nFrom the new search results, the relevant spans are:\n\n- `Request.__init__`: This span includes the initialization of the hooks dictionary. The current implementation iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook using the `register_hook` method. This needs to be updated to accept and correctly register lists of hooks.\n- `Request.register_hook`: This method registers a hook for a specific event. It appends the hook to the list of hooks for that event, which implies it can handle multiple hooks per event.\n- `dispatch_hook`: This function is responsible for calling the hooks. It needs to handle the case where a list of hooks is provided.",
