The relevant files to focus on are `requests/models.py`, `requests/hooks.py`, and potentially `requests/sessions.py` since this is where the `Request` class and its method `register_hook` are defined, as well as where hooks might be used or passed around. Additionally, the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` might be relevant since it uses hooks in its `request` method.

The search results contain relevant code spans in the 'requests/models.py' file, specifically in the '__init__' and 'register_hook' methods of the Request class. These methods manage the hooks dictionary and the registration of hooks, respectively. The 'dispatch_hook' function in 'requests/hooks.py' also processes hooks and is relevant. The 'request' method in the Session class within 'requests/sessions.py' constructs a Request object and handles hooks.

When the hooks are registered, each value from the hooks dictionary is added directly to the `self.hooks` dictionary without checking if the value is a list or a single function. This means that if a list of hook functions is passed, it will be added as a list and not be handled as individual hooks. The `dispatch_hook` function in `requests/hooks.py` also does not handle lists directly but expects the hooks to be stored as a list within the hooks dictionary, which is not ensured by the current implementation.\n\nIn the `Session` class method `request` in `requests/sessions.py`, hooks are merged with session hooks and then passed to the `Request` class without additional handling for lists of hook functions. This adds consistency concerns, as the handling of hooks in the `Session` class should align with that in the `Request` class.\n\nTo address the issue, the `Request.__init__` method should be modified to handle lists of hook functions appropriately by flattening them into the `self.hooks` dictionary. Additionally, the `dispatch_hook` function should be checked to ensure it can handle lists directly if the current implementation does not already cover this. Lastly, consistency should be maintained in how hooks are handled between the `Session` and `Request` classes.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
