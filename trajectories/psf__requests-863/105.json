Currently, the code only supports a single hook function per hook, and it fails when a list of hook functions is provided. The goal is to modify the __init__ method to accept lists as values for the hooks parameter, allowing for multiple hooks to be specified easily. To address this, we need to find and modify the code in the Request.__init__ method where the hooks parameter is processed. Additionally, we should review the Session class and its interaction with hooks to ensure compatibility and consider improvements to the register_hook method if necessary.",

Specifically, it notes that the current implementation wraps the list in another list, which leads to failures when the hooks are consumed as lists are not callable. To address this, the code needs to be modified so that it can accept and correctly process lists of hook functions. The relevant code spans are identified in the `requests/models.py` file, particularly the `Request.__init__` and `Request.register_hook` methods. These methods are responsible for initializing and registering hooks, respectively. The changes needed involve updating the logic in `Request.__init__` to handle lists of hook functions appropriately, ensuring that each hook function in the list is correctly registered. This would simplify the process of adding multiple hooks, making it easier to manage and use different hooks in a session. Additionally, the `Session.request` method in `requests/sessions.py` is also relevant as it interacts with the hooks and forwards them to the Request object.",
