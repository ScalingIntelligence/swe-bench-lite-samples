This involves ensuring that if a list of hook functions is provided for a hook event, the code doesn't wrap it in another list but processes it correctly. The relevant code span to be modified is identified in the `Request.__init__()` method where the hooks dictionary is iterated and hooks are registered. Additionally, the issue mentions the annoyance caused by the current method, suggesting that an update in this area would streamline the process. After examining the `requests/models.py` and `requests/sessions.py` files, I have identified the specific location in `Request.__init__()` that needs adjustment or improvement to facilitate the handling of lists within hook values.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
