The provided search results show the code for the Request class, including the __init__ method and the register_hook method. The relevant parts are: 1. The __init__ method where the hooks dictionary is processed. 2. The register_hook method where a hook is registered. The goal is to identify the code spans that relate to the hooks argument and the handling of hooks in the Request class. The __init__ method currently processes the hooks argument by iterating over its items and registering each one individually. This approach would not handle a list of functions correctly, as mentioned in the issue.

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
