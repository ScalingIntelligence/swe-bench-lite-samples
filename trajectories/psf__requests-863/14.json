It is stated that the current implementation in `Request.__init__()` does not correctly handle the case where a list of hook functions is provided, leading to errors when consuming the hooks due to the list being nested within another list. This issue restricts the ability to use multiple hooks from a session without creating the request object and calling `.register_hook()` multiple times.\n\nThe analysis of the provided code reveals that the python file `requests/models.py` contains the definition of the `Request` class and its `__init__` method. This method is where the hooks are processed. Following the method's logic, it iterates through each hook provided in the `hooks` argument and registers it via the `register_hook()` method. However, it currently does not correctly handle a list of hook functions as values. \n\nThe `hooks.py` file, though not directly related to the issue, contains the `dispatch_hook` function, which is used in the `Request` class's hook handling but is not the focus of the reported issue regarding the handling of lists as hook values.\n\nThe identified relevant code span that needs to be addressed is the part in `Request.__init__()` where hooks are processed.

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
