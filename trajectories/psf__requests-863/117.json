Specifically, the code currently only supports a single hook function per hook, and any attempt to pass a list of hook functions results in the list being wrapped in another list, causing it to fail when consumed as a callable. The solution proposed is to modify the initialization of the Request object to accept lists in the hook values, allowing for multiple hooks per event.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant sections of code are within the Request class, particularly the __init__ method and the register_hook method. The __init__ method current processes the 'hooks' argument in a way that does not support lists, which is the core issue described. The register_hook method is also relevant as it is the method used to actually add hooks to the Request object.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are the entire __init__ method and the entire register_hook method, as these are directly involved in handling the hooks parameter and registering hooks, respectively.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
