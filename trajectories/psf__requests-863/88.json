The current implementation does not support lists of hook functions per hook, which complicates the process of registering multiple hooks. To address this, the search should focus on the `Request` class, particularly its `__init__` method and how it processes the `hooks` argument. It would also be beneficial to examine the `Session` class, as it interacts with the `Request` class and might also handle or pass the `hooks` argument. Additionally, the `hooks.py` module should be reviewed for any utility functions related to hooks that could be used or modified.",
