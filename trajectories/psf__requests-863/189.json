Currently, if a list of hook functions is passed for a hook, the code wraps the list in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed due to the list not being callable. The solution suggested is to modify the parsing of the 'hooks' parameter in Request.__init__() to accept lists as its values. The relevant code spans identified in the search results confirm this issue and the need for a change in the way the 'hooks' parameter is processed in the Request class.

The provided file context includes the `Request` class initialization and hook registration, which currently iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook individually. The `dispatch_hook` function in `requests/hooks.py` is also provided, showing how hooks are processed. However, the current implementation does not check for or handle lists of hook functions, which is the core requirement of the issue. The `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` also merges hooks from the session, which could be related to managing multiple hooks per event. Based on the provided context, critical parts of the code relevant to hooks are present, but the specific enhancement to accept lists of hook functions is not yet implemented. Further investigation is needed into the handling and merging of hooks in the Session class.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
