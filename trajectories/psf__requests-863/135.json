The __init__ method of the Request class where hooks are initially processed and registered. 2. The register_hook method of the Request class which handles the registration of hooks. 3.

Specifically, it does not properly handle lists of hook functions, which can cause issues when attempting to register multiple hooks. The current implementation only allows a single hook function per hook event, which is problematic. The solution suggested in the issue is to modify the `Request.__init__()` method to accept lists of hook functions as values in the `hooks` dictionary. This would simplify the process of registering multiple hooks. Given the current context and search results, the relevant code spans to address this issue are found in `requests/models.py` within the `Request.__init__()` method.
