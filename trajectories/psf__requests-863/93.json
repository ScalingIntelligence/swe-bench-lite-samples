Specifically, it currently does not support lists of hook functions per hook, leading to errors when a list is passed. To resolve this, we need to find the relevant parts of the code that handle the hooks argument, particularly in the initialization of the Request class, and modify it to accept and correctly process lists. The main files to look into for this issue are requests/models.py, which contains the Request class, and possibly requests/sessions.py, which involves Session handling and merging of kwargs, including hooks. Searching within these files for the initialization method (__init__) and the method register_hook in the Request class should help identify the precise locations where the change is needed.",

The current implementation wraps lists in lists if they are provided, causing errors when the hooks are consumed. The goal is to allow for multiple hook functions per hook by accepting lists as values in the hooks dictionary.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the `Request.__init__` and `Request.register_hook` methods in the `requests/models.py` file. These methods currently handle hooks but do not properly account for lists of hook functions. The `Request.__init__` method iterates over the hooks dictionary and calls `register_hook` for each key-value pair, which could be a single hook function or a list of hook functions. The `register_hook` method simply appends the hook function to the corresponding event list in the `self.hooks` dictionary.\n\nTo address the issue, the `Request.__init__` method needs to be modified to handle lists of hook functions correctly. This would likely involve checking if the value for each key in the hooks dictionary is a list and then iterating over that list to register each hook function individually. No changes are needed in the `register_hook` method, but awareness of how it works is important for understanding the context in which the issue arises. No relevant code is found in the `requests/sessions.py` file related to this specific issue, although the Session class uses hooks and might benefit indirectly from this change.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
