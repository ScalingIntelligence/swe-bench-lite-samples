The current implementation does not support passing lists of hook functions, which complicates the use of multiple hooks, especially from a session. To address this, the Request.__init__() method should be modified to correctly parse the 'hooks' parameter and accept lists as its values. Given the provided context, it's likely that the relevant code will be found in the 'Request' class definition within the 'requests/models.py' file, but it's also possible that the handling of hooks in sessions is part of the 'Session' class in 'requests/sessions.py'. Also, considering the broader context of how hooks are managed, the 'requests/hooks.py' file might contain relevant functionality.",

Currently, the method does not correctly handle cases where a list of hook functions is provided. Instead, it wraps the list in another list, causing a failure when attempted to be called. The goal is to modify the Request.__init__() method to handle lists of hook functions appropriately.\n\nAnalyzing the search results:\n\n1. In 'requests/models.py', the __init__ method of the Request class is found where the hooks argument is iterated over, and each key-value pair is registered using the register_hook method. This is the primary area of the code that should be modified to correctly handle lists of hook functions.\n\n2. The register_hook method is also located within 'requests/models.py', and it appends every hook directly to the self.hooks list.\n\nBased on the issue description, the focus should be on the __init__ method of the Request class to ensure it correctly handles lists of hook functions instead of assuming each value in the hooks dictionary is a single function.\n\nTo address the issue, modifications need to be made at the point where hooks are processed in the __init__ method. Instead of just appending whatever value is provided for a hook, the code should check if the value is a list and then append each item from the list individually if it is. This would allow for multiple hooks to be provided for the same event and ensure that if a single function is provided, it is handled correctly as well.\n\nGiven the provided search results, the following spans are identified as relevant for addressing the issue:\n\n- requests/models.py > Request.__init__\n- requests/models.py > Request.register_hook\n\nThese spans should cover the necessary modifications to correctly handle multiple hook functions per hook event.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
