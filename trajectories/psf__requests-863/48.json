The current implementation does not support lists of hook functions per hook, which is causing problems, especially when trying to use multiple hooks from a session. To address this, the Request.__init__() method needs to be modified to correctly parse the hooks parameter, allowing it to accept lists as values. Given the context provided, it's likely that the relevant code is located within the requests/models.py file where the Request class is defined, and possibly in the hooks.py file where the hook dispatch mechanism is defined. There might also be implications in the sessions.py file, especially regarding the Session class's handling of hooks.",

The current implementation wraps any list in another list, which causes issues when the hooks are consumed, as lists are not callable. The relevant files identified in the search results are `requests/models.py` and `requests/hooks.py`. In `requests/models.py`, the `Request.__init__` method is responsible for initializing the Request object and processing the hooks argument. This is where the modification is needed to handle lists of hook functions correctly. The `Request.register_hook` method is also likely to be involved in this process, but it's not shown in the provided code spans. In `requests/hooks.py`, the `dispatch_hook` function processes hooks, and it needs to be able to handle lists of hook functions. The session handling in `requests/sessions.py` is also relevant, as it involves creating and managing requests, including hook management. The identified code spans provide a starting point for the necessary modifications, but more context may be needed to fully understand the interactions and to ensure all relevant parts are addressed.",

The current implementation in `Request.__init__` does not correctly accommodate lists of hook functions, causing unexpected behavior. To address this, the relevant code spans need to be identified, focusing on the `__init__`, `register_hook`, and potentially the `send` methods of the `Request` class. Additionally, understanding the session-related usage of hooks might be necessary for a complete solution. The provided search results include the necessary files and code spans that are relevant to the issue. These spans are: the `__init__` method of the `Request` class in 'requests/models.py', which initializes the hooks; the `dispatch_hook` method in 'requests/hooks.py', which handles the hook dispatching; and the `request` method in 'requests/sessions.py', which demonstrates how hooks are integrated when making a request. This collection of code spans should provide a comprehensive view of the current implementation and serve as a basis for making necessary modifications to handle lists of hook functions more gracefully.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
