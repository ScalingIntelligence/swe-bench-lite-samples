The current implementation in Request.__init__() does not handle lists properly, leading to errors when lists of hook functions are passed. The main focus is on Request.__init__() and Request.register_hook() methods in the 'requests/models.py' file. The existing code in Request.__init__() iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook separately. This setup does not accommodate lists of hooks. Additionally, the dispatch_hook function in 'requests/hooks.py' ensures that single hook functions are converted into lists if needed, which indirectly supports the handling of multiple hooks but not through the Request.__init__() method. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those dealing with the hooks dictionary in Request.__init__() and the logic around registering hooks in Request.register_hook().",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
