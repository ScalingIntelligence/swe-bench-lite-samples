Specifically, it can only accept a single hook function per hook event, and if a list of hook functions is provided, it results in an error. To address this, we need to identify where in the code the hooks parameter is processed and ensure that if a list of hook functions is provided, it is handled correctly. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are in the Request class's __init__ method and the register_hook method. In the __init__ method, when processing the hooks parameter, the code iterates over each item in the hooks dictionary and calls register_hook with each key and value. However, the current implementation does not check if the value is a list and thus does not handle lists properly. I will identify these spans in the search results as relevant.",

The reported issue identifies a problem with the `Request` class's `__init__` method not properly handling lists in the `hooks` argument, causing the list to be wrapped in another list and leading to a failure when the hooks are consumed. 2. The current context provided shows the `Request` class's `__init__` method, where the issue likely resides, and its `register_hook` method, which will potentially need modification if changes are made to the hook handling logic. 3. Analyzing the new search results, particularly the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py`, provides more context on how hooks are handled during a session. This includes how hooks are merged and passed to the `Request` object in the `request` method. 4. Key spans to note include the `Session` class definition and its `request` method, as these interact directly with the `Request` class's hook handling functionality. These sections will help in understanding the broader context and flow of hook manipulation in the session. 5. The `Session.request` method particularly stands out as it merges hooks from the session and constructs the `Request` object, making it a critical area for potential changes if the fix would involve altering how hooks are handled at a session level before being passed to the `Request` object.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
