The issue suggests that the 'hooks' parameter should be parsed to accept lists as values, which would allow for multiple hooks per event. This would simplify the method of registering multiple hooks, making the process less cumbersome. \n\nAnalyzing the provided code snippets, the relevant part of the code is found in the 'requests/models.py' file, within the 'Request' class and its '__init__' method. The current implementation iterates over the 'hooks' dictionary and registers each hook individually, which does not handle lists within the dictionary values as expected. The 'Response' class does handle cookies using a similar mechanism in its '_build_response' method, which could potentially serve as a template for implementing lists in hook management.\n\nGiven that the current context does not identify any relevant code, and based on the provided code snippets, the 'Request.__init__' method in the 'requests/models.py' file appears to be the primary location of concern. This section of the code deals directly with initializing the 'Request' class and handling the 'hooks' parameter as currently implemented. Therefore, identifying this span of code as the most relevant to address the reported issue.",
