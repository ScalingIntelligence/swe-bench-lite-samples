The current implementation in Request.__init__() does not correctly handle lists of hook functions, leading to issues when these hooks are consumed. To address this, the Request.__init__() method should be modified to correctly parse and handle lists within the hooks dictionary. The provided file context already includes the affected method Request.__init__(), where the hooks dictionary is processed. Additionally, the Session.request() method in the sessions.py file is also relevant as it initializes and sends the Request object, potentially passing hooks as an argument. The search results confirm the presence of Session and its request method, which is essential for understanding how hooks are passed from a session to a request. Therefore, further modification of Request.__init__() to handle lists in the hooks dictionary and perhaps examining the consumption of hooks in Request._build_response() or elsewhere in the codebase would be necessary steps to address the issue.",
