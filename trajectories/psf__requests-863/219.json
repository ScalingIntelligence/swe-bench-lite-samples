The current implementation in Request.__init__() incorrectly wraps the list in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. To resolve this, the hooks parameter in Request.__init__() should be parsed to accept lists as values. Analyzing the code, the relevant sections are found in the Request class within models.py and in the Session class within sessions.py. In models.py, the Request.__init__() method and the Request.register_hook() method are critical for understanding how hooks are currently handled and how they can be improved to accept lists. In sessions.py, the Session class is relevant because it interacts with the Request class and also handles hooks. The Session.request() method is particularly important as it sets up a request and could benefit from the ability to pass multiple hooks. These sections of code are the focus for addressing the issue of allowing lists in the dict values of the hooks argument.",

Specifically, the code within Request.__init__ deals with the 'hooks' parameter and currently iterates over the provided hooks dictionary, registering each hook. However, it does not explicitly check for or handle lists of hook functions, which is the core problem addressed in the issue. Additionally, the Session class and its handling of requests are also included in the file context, which is relevant considering the issue's reference to using hooks from a session. Therefore, the current file context seems to cover the necessary areas for identifying and potentially modifying the code to better handle multiple hooks. Nonetheless, the exact location where a list of hook functions would be checked and processed appropriately within the Request.__init__ method is not explicitly shown as changed or implemented, but the existing code structure in the file context outlines where such changes should ideally be made.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
