Specifically, the current implementation does not properly handle cases where the 'hooks' parameter is a dictionary with lists as values, which represents multiple hook functions per event. This leads to the wrapping of lists within lists, causing a failure when attempting to call these hooks. To address this, the relevant sections of code to be modified are within the __init__ method of both the Session and Request classes in the provided search results. The Session class's __init__ method uses 'from_key_val_list' to parse the 'hooks' dictionary, which may not handle lists correctly. Similarly, the Request class's __init__ method needs to be updated to ensure that it properly iterates over and registers multiple hooks if a list is provided. These identified code spans are crucial for implementing the necessary changes to allow lists in the dict values of the 'hooks' argument.",

The current context provides insights into how hooks are handled within the Session and Request classes, particularly in the `__init__` methods of both classes. The search results provided additional information on how hooks are dispatched and how key-value lists are handled. However, the initial file context did not explicitly show how lists were currently being handled for hooks in the hooks argument. Having analyzed the code, key areas of focus include: 1. Modifying the handling of hooks in the `__init__` method of the Request class to accept lists as values. 2. Ensuring that if a list is provided for a hook, it is correctly stored and can be later dispatched without causing errors. Given the current context and search results, I identified that the function `from_key_val_list` in `requests/utils.py` might be a critical function to modify since it currently does not handle lists correctly for hooks. Additionally, understanding how hooks are dispatched (`dispatch_hook` in `requests/hooks.py`) is crucial for ensuring the hooks can handle lists as expected without errors when executed.",

The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
