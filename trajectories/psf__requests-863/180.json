Currently, it only allows specifying one hook function per hook, and it incorrectly handles lists of hook functions. To address this, we need to find the __init__ method of the Request class and the related hooks processing logic in the codebase. We should also consider the session handling since the issue mentions difficulties when using multiple hooks from a session. By specifying the class name 'Request' and the method name '__init__', and checking the hooks handling code in the relevant files, we can pinpoint the exact locations to modify.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
