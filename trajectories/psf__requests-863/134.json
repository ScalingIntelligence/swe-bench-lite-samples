Currently, the `Request.register_hook()` method only allows one hook function per hook, which is inconvenient. The solution involves modifying the `Request.__init__()` method to properly handle lists of hook functions. We should search for the `Request` class definition and its constructor `__init__()` method across the relevant files. Additionally, we should look for the usage of the `hooks` parameter in the `Session` class's `request()` method, as it is the likely place where the `hooks` parameter is passed to a new `Request` object. Searching for these specifics should help us locate the necessary code to fix this issue.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
