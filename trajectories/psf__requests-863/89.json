Specifically, the .register_hook() method can only accept one hook function per hook, and lists of hook functions are not supported. This makes it inconvenient to use multiple hooks from a session. To resolve this, the Request.__init__() method should be modified to accept lists as values in the hooks dictionary. Given the context, it's likely that the relevant code snippet is in the models.py file, focusing on the Request class and its __init__ method. Additionally, the hooks.py file may contain utility functions related to hooks. The Session class in sessions.py and possibly the api.py file for how requests are made and how hooks might be managed.",

Specifically, the issue is that the code does not correctly handle a dictionary where the values are lists of hook functions. When such a dictionary is passed, the current implementation wraps the list inside another list, leading to a failure when the hooks are consumed. The solution suggested is to modify the Request.__init__() method to correctly parse the hooks parameter such that it accepts lists as its values. \n\nTo address this issue, we first need to analyze the existing code in the Request class's __init__ method, specifically the part where hooks are processed. The initial examination shows that the code iterates over the hooks dictionary and calls the register_hook method for each key-value pair. However, it does not check if the value is a list and directly assigns it, which is the root cause of the problem. \n\nThus, to fix the issue, the code should be modified to check if a hook's value is a list and then iterate over this list to register each hook individually. This requires a change in the Request.__init__() method, including logic to handle list values appropriately. \n\nFrom the search results provided, the relevant code spans are within the Request.__init__() method and the Request.register_hook() method. These are the parts of the codebase that need to be adjusted to accommodate the suggested change. The rest of the code does not directly deal with the hooks parameter in a way that would help address the issue.",
