The current implementation wraps the list in another list, causing an error when attempting to call a list as a function. The goal is to modify the initialization of the Request class to accept lists directly as values in the hooks argument.\n\nFrom the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant sections of code are present in both 'requests/hooks.py' and 'requests/sessions.py'. The 'dispatch_hook' function in 'hooks.py' processes hooks and handles single hook functions or lists of them. In 'sessions.py', the Session class and its '__init__' method are significant, as hooks are initialized and used here. Additionally, the 'request' method in the Session class processes and passes hooks to the Request class.\n\nGiven these insights, the identified spans 'dispatch_hook' in 'hooks.py' and 'Session.__init__' and 'Session.request' in 'sessions.py' are essential for addressing the issue. These spans cover the initialization and dispatching of hooks, which are central to the reported problem.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
