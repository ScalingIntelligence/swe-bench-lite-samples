Specifically, the issue is that the current implementation does not handle lists of hook functions properly, which leads to unexpected behavior when multiple hooks are attempted to be registered for a single event. The provided search results contain the relevant code spans, specifically the `__init__` and `register_hook` methods of the `Request` class in `requests/models.py`. These code spans directly address the issue by showing how the `hooks` dictionary is currently processed and how a single hook is registered per event. To resolve the issue, modifications to the `__init__` method would be necessary to properly handle list values within the `hooks` dictionary, allowing for the registration of multiple hooks per event during the initialization of a `Request` object. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant and pivotal for addressing the reported issue.",

The search results confirmed the presence of these methods, which parse and handle the 'hooks' parameter.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
