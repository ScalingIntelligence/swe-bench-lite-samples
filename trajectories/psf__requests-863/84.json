The Session class's __init__ method in 'requests/sessions.py' is found to be relevant as it initializes hooks using from_key_val_list, which is a likely candidate for parsing the hooks parameter.\n\nAdditionally, in 'requests/models.py', the Request class's __init__ method and register_hook method are crucial. The __init__ method processes the hooks parameter using a loop that registers each hook without checking if the value is a list. The register_hook method simply appends the hook to the list of hooks for the given event without considering the possibility of a list input.\n\nGiven the issue description, these code spans appear to be directly related to the problem at hand.

There is no explicit handling for lists within the hooks, which might be causing the issue when a list is passed in the hooks parameter. To address this, the __init__ method should be modified to handle lists of hooks, rather than just single hook functions. This requires identifying where in the code the hooks are being set up in the Request class initialization, and ensuring that lists are appropriately iterated over or appended to. The search should focus on the __init__ method of the Request class, particularly where it iterates over the hooks and adds them to the Request instance.",

The current implementation iterates over the hooks and registers each one individually via the `register_hook` method. However, it does not explicitly check or handle the case where a hook value is a list. This is what causes the issue when a list of hook functions is provided. The solution would be to adjust the `__init__` method to check if the value (v) associated with each hook key (k) is a list, and if so, iterate over the list and register each hook individually. This way, a list of hook functions can be correctly handled without treating the list as a single entity. Thus, we must locate the part of the __init__ method where hooks are processed and ensure that lists of hook functions are correctly iterated over and registered.",
