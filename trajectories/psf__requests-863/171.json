            "scratch_pad": "The issue at hand revolves around the limitation in handling hook functions in the Request class. Currently, the .register_hook() method only supports specifying one hook function per hook. The problem arises when a list of hook functions is passed, as the code in Request.__init__() wraps the list in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. To address this, we need to modify Request.__init__() to parse the hooks parameter in such a way that it can accept lists as its values. This will streamline the process and allow multiple hooks to be used from a session without the need for multiple steps. The relevant files to focus on are likely 'requests/models.py' and potentially 'requests/sessions.py', where the Session class might interact with the Request class. Additionally, 'requests/hooks.py' should be reviewed to understand how hooks are dispatched.",

To address the issue, the __init__ method should be modified to check if the value for each hook is a list and then iterate over the list to register each hook individually. Since the relevant code for parsing hooks and handling them is present in the file context, the issue can be addressed by modifying the __init__ method of the Request class.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
