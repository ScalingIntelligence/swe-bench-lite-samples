Currently, the method processes the `hooks` parameter in a way that assumes each hook key has a single function value. If a list of functions is provided, it leads to errors due to the list not being callable. The suggested solution is to modify `Request.__init__()` to accept lists as values in the `hooks` dictionary, allowing for multiple hook functions per hook key. This enhancement would simplify the process of registering multiple hooks for a request without needing to create and manage the request object separately. The analysis of the provided code shows that the `Request.__init__()` method does iterate over the `hooks` dictionary but does not check or handle the case where the value is a list. The `Request.register_hook()` method is already capable of registering multiple hooks for the same event, as it appends hooks to a list. Therefore, the key modification needed is in `Request.__init__()`, where it should iterate over and append each item in a list to the hooks if the value is indeed a list.",

The goal is to modify the Request.__init__() method to accept lists of hook functions as values for the 'hooks' parameter. \n\nIn the file context provided, the Request.__init__() method and the register_hook() method are already identified. The Request.__init__() method initializes the Request object and processes the 'hooks' argument by registering each hook provided in the dictionary. However, it does not currently check or handle the case where the hook value is a list of functions. \n\nIn the new search results, there is a continuation of the Request class with the Request.__init__() method and the register_hook() method. The register_hook() method simply appends the hook to the list of hooks for the given event. This confirms that the current implementation does not handle lists of hooks. \n\nTo address the issue, modifications need to be made to the Request.__init__() method to handle lists within the 'hooks' dictionary gracefully. This involves iterating over the values of the 'hooks' dictionary and checking if the value is a list. If it is a list, each hook in the list should be registered separately.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
