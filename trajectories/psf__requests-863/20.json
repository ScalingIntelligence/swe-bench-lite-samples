The search results provided contain the relevant code for the Request class, specifically the __init__() and register_hook() methods. Additionally, there are relevant sections in the Session class, particularly the __init__() and request() methods, which might be affected by changes needed for the hooks parameter in the Request class. The identified code spans show how hooks are currently managed and processed, highlighting the areas where modifications would be needed to support lists of hook functions. This analysis helps to identify the exact parts of the code that require adjustments to implement the desired feature.",

The provided code in the Request class's __init__ method iterates over the hooks and calls register_hook, but it does not handle lists of hook functions correctly. This confirms the relevance of the code to the reported issue. Additionally, the Session class is relevant because it interacts with the Request class and manages hooks.

The initial change applied the correct logic to handle lists by iterating over each hook in the list and appending them to the `self.hooks` dictionary. This change effectively resolves the issue by allowing multiple hook functions per event without causing nested lists.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
