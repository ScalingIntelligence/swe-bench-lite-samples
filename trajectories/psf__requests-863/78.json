From the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `requests/models.py` file. Here are the relevant details from the search results:\n\n1. The `Request` class's `register_hook` method appends a hook to the list of hooks for a given event.\n2. The `Request` class's `deregister_hook` method removes a hook from the list of hooks for a given event.\n3. The `Request` class's `send` method dispatches hooks at various points in the request process.\n4. The `dispatch_hook` function in `requests/hooks.py` is responsible for executing the hooks.\n\nThese spans of code are relevant because they directly handle the hooks system that the issue is concerned with. The issue requires modifying the `Request` class's constructor to accept lists of hook functions per hook event, and these code spans already manage the hooks, making them crucial for implementing the fix.",

The issue mentions the hooks parameter in the __init__ method and how multiple hook functions should be allowed within the lists of the hooks dictionary. When examining the __init__ method, it's evident that the current implementation of handling the hooks parameter does not account for lists of hook functions. The code iterates over hooks and directly registers each hook, which would fail if a list is provided. This indicates the need for the Request class's __init__ method to be updated to handle lists within the hooks dictionary values. Additionally, the requests/hooks.py file context shows the dispatch_hook function that is likely used when the hooks are consumed. Overall, it seems that changes are needed in the Request class's handling of the hooks parameter, but the current file context accurately reflects the issue's request.

Currently, the `Request.__init__()` method parses the `hooks` argument in a way that it only accepts one hook function per hook, and if a list is passed, it fails when the hooks are consumed. The task is to modify `Request.__init__()` to accept lists as its values for the `hooks` parameter.\n\nI have reviewed the provided file context and search results. The key code spans to focus on are in the `Request.__init__()` method where the hooks are processed. Currently, it only appends the hook function to the list without checking if it's a list itself. This causes the issue when a list of hook functions is provided.\n\nTo address this, the `Request.__init__()` method should be modified to check if the value (`v`) for each key in the `hooks` dictionary is a list. If it is, all elements of the list should be appended to the `self.hooks` list for that event. This way, multiple hooks can be provided at once without wrapping the list in another list.\n\nThe relevant code spans from the search results that need modification are the `Request.__init__()` method and potentially any other methods that interact with the `hooks` parameter, such as `register_hook()`.

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
