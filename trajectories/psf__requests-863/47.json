Specifically, the current implementation of 'Request.__init__()' does not handle lists within the hooks dictionary correctly, which leads to issues when multiple hooks are needed. The task is to identify code spans that are relevant to this issue. \n\nIn the provided search results, we can see the definition of the 'Request' class and its '__init__()' method. The '__init__()' method initializes the 'hooks' attribute from the 'hooks' argument provided to the constructor. The method iterates over the items in the 'hooks' dictionary and registers each hook using the 'register_hook()' method. This is the part where the current implementation fails to handle lists, as it treats each value as a single hook function rather than potentially being a list of functions. Therefore, the relevant code spans are where the hooks are initialized and registered in the 'Request' class. The relevant spans are 'Request.__init__' and 'Request.register_hook'. These spans show how hooks are handled upon the initialization of a 'Request' object and how a hook is registered, respectively.",
