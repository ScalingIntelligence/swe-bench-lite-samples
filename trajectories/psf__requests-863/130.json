Currently, the method does not correctly handle lists, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. To address this, the search should focus on the `Request` class and its handling of the `hooks` argument within the `__init__` method. Additionally, checking the `Session` class in `sessions.py` is important since it interacts with the `Request` class and could potentially be a source of the issue when using multiple hooks from a session.",

The issue states that the `hooks` argument in the `Request` class constructor does not handle lists of hook functions correctly. When a list is provided, it is wrapped in another list, which causes a failure when the hooks are consumed because a list is not callable. The solution proposed is to modify the `__init__` method to correctly handle lists of hook functions. The relevant code span in question is where the `hooks` argument is processed, specifically within the `for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):` loop. This is the section of the code that needs to be updated to handle lists properly.\n\nAdditionally, we should consider the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` since the issue also mentions the inability to use multiple hooks from a session. However, the provided `Session` class code does not directly affect the issue at hand, as it relates more to the `Request` class's handling of hooks. Therefore, it is not necessary to select any spans from `requests/sessions.py` for the immediate solution.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans to focus on are within the `Request.__init__` method in `requests/models.py`.",

This behavior is undesirable, especially when trying to use multiple hooks from a session. The solution proposed is to modify Request.__init__() to parse the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as its values.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code, especially the span with id 'Request.__init__', it's clear that the current implementation iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook individually using self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v). This is likely where the problem arises if 'v' is a list instead of a single function. To fix this, the code needs to be adjusted to gracefully handle lists of hook functions and register each function in the list.\n\nThe search results also include several other spans within the Request class such as __repr__, _build_response, _encode_params, _encode_files, full_url, path_url, register_hook, deregister_hook, and send, which provide context around how the Request class functions. However, none of these spans directly address the issue with handling multiple hooks.\n\nTo effectively tackle the issue, the identified span 'Request.__init__' in the search results is relevant as it initializes and processes the hooks argument, which appears to be where the bug occurs.\n\nBased on this analysis, the fix would involve enhancing the treatment of the 'hooks' parameter within the '__init__' method to check if the value associated with each key is a list, and if so, iterate over this list to register each hook function individually.",

The `__init__` method initializes the `hooks` dictionary, and the `register_hook` method appends new hooks to this dictionary. This suggests that the existing infrastructure is in place to handle multiple hooks per event. However, there is no explicit example or test case provided in the file context that demonstrates handling lists of hook functions directly inside the `__init__` method. This suggests that some improvement or modification would be needed in `__init__`. As such, while the structure for supporting multiple hooks exists, the enhancement to handle lists of hook functions directly within `__init__` as per the request might require further implementation details to be provided elsewhere in the codebase or documentation.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
