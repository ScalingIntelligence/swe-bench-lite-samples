The code snippet shows how hooks are initially set up as empty dictionaries and then populated by iterating over the hooks dictionary. However, the current implementation does not check if the hook value is a list and thus does not handle the case where multiple hooks are provided for a single event. This matches the description of the issue. The register_hook method, which is used to add hooks, also does not check for lists, instead it simply appends the hook provided.

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
