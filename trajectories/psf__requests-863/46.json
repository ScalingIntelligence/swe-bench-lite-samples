Specifically, the Request.__init__() method currently only allows one hook function per hook event, and it fails when a list of hook functions is provided, as the list gets wrapped in another list, making it uncallable when the hooks are consumed.\n\nThe analysis of the provided search results reveals several relevant code spans within the Request class that are pertinent to the issue at hand. These include the __init__ method where the hooks are initialized and processed, the register_hook method for adding hooks, and the deregister_hook method for removing hooks. Additionally, the send method where the hooks might be executed could also be relevant, though not directly addressed in the reported issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most directly relevant spans for addressing the reported issue are those in the __init__ and register_hook methods. The __init__ method should be modified to handle lists of hook functions correctly, and the register_hook method should ensure that lists are handled appropriately when adding hooks to the Request object.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
