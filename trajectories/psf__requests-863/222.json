Specifically, the problem lies in the fact that the hooks argument can only specify one hook function per hook, and it fails when a list of hook functions is provided. To address this, we need to find the implementation of the Request class's initialization method to see how it processes the hooks argument. Additionally, we should look into how the hooks are consumed to understand why a list of hook functions is causing issues. Focusing on the 'requests/models.py' file is crucial, as it contains the Request class, and potentially other files that interact with or modify the hooks, such as 'requests/hooks.py' and 'requests/sessions.py'.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
