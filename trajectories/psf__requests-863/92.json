The current implementation in the '__init__' method of the Request class does not handle lists properly and instead wraps the list in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. The solution involves modifying the '__init__' method to correctly parse the 'hooks' parameter when it contains lists. The relevant code spans are identified in the '__init__' method where the 'hooks' parameter is processed and in the 'register_hook' method where hooks are registered. These code spans need to be adjusted to correctly handle lists of hook functions.\n\n1. The '__init__' method processes the 'hooks' parameter and registers each hook. If a list is passed as a value for a hook, it is wrapped in another list and this needs to be corrected to iterate through each function in the list and register them individually.\n\n2. The 'register_hook' method already appends hooks to the appropriate event list, so it does not need significant changes. However, ensuring that lists of hooks are handled correctly from the '__init__' method up to the 'register_hook' method is crucial.\n\n3. By analyzing these code spans, it is clear that the key modification should occur in the processing part of the '__init__' method to correctly parse 'hooks' when lists are passed. This will lead to the desired functionality where multiple hooks can be specified directly in the 'hooks' argument of the Request constructor.",

We need to identify code spans that handle the hooks in the Request class's `__init__` method and the `register_hook` method. Additionally, we should look for any related handling in the Session class, especially in methods that interact with the Request class.\n\nFrom the provided context, we see the `Request.__init__` and `Request.register_hook` methods in `requests/models.py`. The `__init__` method initializes the hooks as an empty dictionary and then registers each provided hook. However, it currently does not check for lists of hooks, which is the root of the problem.\n\nIn the search results, we find `Session.__init__` and `Session.request` methods in `requests/sessions.py`. The `Session.__init__` method initializes the hooks similarly to the `Request` class. The `Session.request` method constructs a `Request` object and sets hooks from the session's hooks. This relationship suggests that if we modify the `Request` class to handle lists of hooks properly, we should also ensure that the `Session` class can pass lists of hooks correctly.\n\nGiven the context and the search results, the identified spans in the `Request` class need to be modified to handle lists and ensure that the `Session` class can pass these lists without errors.",

Specifically, it is noted that the method does not handle lists of hook functions properly, which can lead to errors when the hooks are consumed. The current implementation is seen in the Request.__init__ and Request.register_hook methods where the hooks are processed. The task is to modify the Request.__init__ method to accept lists of hook functions as values in the hooks dictionary. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code that deal with hooks in the Request class. The search results show that the hooks parameter is processed in both the Request.__init__ and Session.request methods. In the Request.__init__ method, the hooks are iterated over and registered using the register_hook method. The Session.request method also processes hooks but primarily focuses on dispatching them. The relevant code spans include the entire Request.__init__ and Request.register_hook methods as they deal directly with processing hooks. Therefore, these spans should be identified as highly relevant to the reported issue.",
