This would simplify the process of registering multiple hooks and improve usability, especially when dealing with session hooks. The current implementation in Request.__init__() and the surrounding methods, like register_hook(), do not support lists of hook functions, leading to issues when users attempt to pass such lists. The focus is on modifying the Request class to handle this scenario correctly.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code from 'requests/models.py', the 'Request.__init__' span contains the relevant code for initializing the hooks within the Request object. The code currently iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook by calling register_hook(). However, it does not check if the value for each hook is a list, which is the primary enhancement required by the issue. Therefore, this span is highly relevant as it is where the changes need to be made to support lists of hook functions. Additionally, the 'Request' span indicates where the Request class starts, providing context for the broader structure of the class.\n\nThere are no relevant spans in the 'requests/packages/oauthlib/common.py' file as the issue is specific to the Request class in the 'requests/models.py' file. Thus, it can be concluded that the identified spans in 'requests/models.py' are relevant for addressing the reported issue. No further search is needed, as the necessary code spans have been identified.",

The current implementation only allows for one hook function per hook, which creates problems when one tries to pass a list of hook functions. The current code in `Request.__init__` will wrap any list in another list, which then fails when the hooks are consumed because a list is not callable. Inspecting the code in the search results, it is clear that the issue arises from the way the hooks are processed in the `Request.__init__` method. Specifically, the line `for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()): self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)` is problematic because it does not check if the value `v` is a list. In the `Request.register_hook` method, it directly appends whatever is passed, without any handling for list types. Therefore, the two relevant code spans to address the reported issue are `Request.__init__` and `Request.register_hook`. These sections need to be updated to support lists as values in the `hooks` dictionary.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
