Currently, if a list of hook functions is passed, it results in an error because the code wraps the list in another list, making it uncallable. The search results contain key sections of the code relevant to this issue. In 'requests/models.py', the 'Request.__init__' method iterates over the 'hooks' dictionary and registers each hook function using the 'register_hook' method. This method appends the hook function to a list in the 'hooks' dictionary. The issue suggests modifying this behavior to handle lists of hook functions appropriately. In 'requests/sessions.py', the 'Session.request' method also handles hooks, but the importance here lies in understanding how hooks are generally managed in the library, which could inform the necessary changes in 'Request.__init__'. The identified code spans are crucial for understanding the current implementation and planning the necessary modifications to support lists in the 'hooks' parameter. The next step would be to modify 'Request.__init__' to correctly handle lists of hook functions and possibly update related methods like 'register_hook' if necessary.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
