Specifically, it mentions that the current implementation does not properly handle lists of hook functions, leading to issues when these hooks are consumed. The issue suggests that modifying Request.__init__() to accept lists within the `hooks` parameter would be beneficial. The provided search results contain a method `dispatch_hook` in the `requests/hooks.py` file which deals with hooks. This function appears to handle the dispatching of hooks but does not directly address the issue with lists within the `hooks` parameter in the Request class. The function converts a single callable hook into a list for processing, which suggests it could potentially be part of the solution for handling lists directly in the `hooks` parameter.\n\nGiven the current context and the issue's requirement, the `dispatch_hook` function seems relevant as it processes hooks and could be a starting point for addressing the issue. However, since the issue specifically targets the `Request.__init__()` method and the description of the problem is not directly addressed by this function, it might be necessary to delve deeper into the implementation of `Request.__init__()` to fully resolve the issue.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
