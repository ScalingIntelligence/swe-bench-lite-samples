Specifically, the issue is that the current implementation of the Request.__init__ method does not properly handle a list of hook functions when specified in the hooks argument. This leads to a limitation where only one hook function can be specified per hook, and if a list is provided, it results in an error. The goal is to modify the Request.__init__ method to correctly parse the hooks parameter and accept lists as values for hooks. The search results contain two files: 'requests/models.py' and 'requests/packages/oauthlib/common.py'. In 'requests/models.py', we find the Request class with its __init__ method and a reference to hook registration. This is the most relevant part of the codebase as it directly deals with the hooks argument and how it is currently handled. The 'requests/packages/oauthlib/common.py' file contains a Request class but does not seem relevant to the hooks argument as it focuses on OAuth-related functionality. Therefore, the identified code spans within 'requests/models.py' are relevant to addressing the issue, and the search task can be considered complete with these findings.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
