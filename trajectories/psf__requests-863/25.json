Currently, the Request.__init__() method processes the hooks argument in a way that only allows a single hook function per hook, and lists of hook functions are not properly handled. The search results include the Request class definition and its __init__ method, which is the primary location where the hooks argument is processed. The identified code spans, specifically the initialization of the hooks attribute and the registration of hooks in the Request.__init__() method, are relevant to this issue. The relevant spans involve the handling of the hooks dictionary and the registration process, which needs to be modified to enable handling of lists of hook functions. This would require changes in the way the hooks are registered and how they are stored within the Request instance. The Session class and its request method are also included in the search results, although these do not directly handle the hooks argument, they are part of the larger context in which the Request class is used. They could be relevant for understanding the interactions and the broader use of the hooks functionality, but for the immediate issue of handling lists in the hooks argument, the focus is primarily on the Request class.",

Instead of accepting lists of hook functions per hook, it wraps the list in another list leading to a failure when invoking the hooks. To address this, changes to the Request.__init__ method and potentially the hooks handling mechanism in both Request and Session classes are necessary. From the provided context, the relevant files and spans are primarily in the 'requests/models.py' which contains the Request class and the Request.__init__ method that needs modification. New search results from 'requests/sessions.py' show the Session class which also handles hooks. The Session.request method integrates hooks, suggesting that proper handling here could supplement the fix proposed for the Request class.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
