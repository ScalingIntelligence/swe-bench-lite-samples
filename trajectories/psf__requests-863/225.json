This requires locating the Request class within the provided file context. From the file context, the Request class is mentioned in multiple files, potentially including models.py, packages/oauthlib/common.py, and packages/urllib3/request.py. The focus should be on the Request class in models.py since it contains methods like register_hook and deregister_hook, which are closely related to the hooks argument functionality. Additionally, the hooks.py file contains relevant functions such as dispatch_hook. The search should also consider the Session class in sessions.py since it has a request method that accepts hooks.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the Request class's .register_hook() method and its handling of the hooks argument. Specifically, the issue is that the hooks argument can only specify one hook function per hook, and if a list of hook functions is passed, it is wrapped in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed. This lack of support for lists as values in the hooks dictionary complicates the use of multiple hooks from a session. The solution proposed is to modify the Request.__init__() method to parse the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as values.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant sections are:\n1. `Request.__init__` in `requests/models.py`: This method currently processes the hooks argument. The reported issue indicates a need to change how this method handles hooks, particularly to support lists of hook functions.\n2. `Request.register_hook` in `requests/models.py`: This method is used to register a hook, but it does not handle lists of hooks currently, supporting only single hook functions.\n\nThese two spans are the focal points for addressing the issue. The `Request.__init__` method needs to be adjusted to correctly parse and support lists in the hooks dictionary, and the `register_hook` method might also require modifications to handle and correctly register multiple hooks at once.\n\nNo other sections directly address the issue of handling lists in the hooks dictionary, so these two spans are sufficient to begin implementing the required changes.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
