Currently, if a list of hook functions is provided for a hook, the code wraps the list in a list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed because a list is not callable. The task is to modify the __init__ method to accept lists of hook functions as its values. The relevant code spans are primarily within the Request.__init__ method, particularly where the hooks are processed, and the register_hook method, which is used to add hooks to the Request instance. By analyzing the provided code spans, it's clear that the hooks are being processed in a way that does not support lists of hook functions. Specifically, in the __init__ method, the hooks are iterated over and registered one by one using self.register_hook. This method currently appends each hook to a list without checking if the hook itself is a list. Therefore, the current implementation does not handle the case where a list of hook functions is provided, which aligns with the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
