Specifically, it states that the current implementation of the `Request.__init__` method does not support lists of hook functions for each event, and instead, it wraps the list in a list which leads to a failure when the hooks are consumed. The issue proposes to change the parsing of the `hooks` parameter in the `Request.__init__` method to accept lists as values.\n\nUpon examination of the provided code, we can identify the relevant sections within the `Request` class. The `Request.__init__` method initializes the `hooks` dictionary and registers hooks using the `register_hook` method. However, the current implementation does not check if the provided hook value is a list and therefore does not handle multiple hooks for the same event.\n\nTo address the issue, the relevant code spans are:\n\n1. The `Request.__init__` method where the initialization of hooks happens.\n2. The `Request.register_hook` method where the hooks are registered.\n\nThese code spans need to be modified to handle lists of hook functions correctly.",

This would ensure that when the hooks are consumed, they are not wrapped in a list unexpectedly. It appears that the necessary modifications to fully resolve the issue would involve recognizing and correctly parsing lists of hook functions in the __init__ method.

The relevant code spans must address this issue in the `Request.__init__` method and possibly in related methods like `register_hook` and `dispatch_hook`. From the provided context in `requests/models.py`, we see the problematic handling of hooks. The new search results in `requests/hooks.py` and `requests/sessions.py` provide additional context on how hooks are processed and dispatched. The analysis suggests that modifying the `Request.__init__` method to correctly handle lists of hook functions as values is essential, and other methods like `dispatch_hook` and `Session.request` may also require adjustments depending on the broader impact on the codebase.",

The self.register_hook method is used to register hooks, but it appends each hook individually, which confirms that the current implementation does not support lists of hook functions. Additionally, the hooks are consumed in the dispatch_hook function in hooks.py, where hooks are processed assuming they are callable or a list of callables. The Session class in sessions.py also interacts with hooks in a manner that seems to expect individual hook functions rather than lists. To fully address the issue, modifications would be needed in the Request class's __init__ method, the register_hook method, and possibly the dispatch_hook function to correctly handle and process lists of hook functions. Given the interactions and the current state of the code, all relevant file context appears to have been identified.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
