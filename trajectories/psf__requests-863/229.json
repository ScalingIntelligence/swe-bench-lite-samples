The search results confirm this by providing the `Request.__init__` method where the hooks are being processed. Specifically, the line 'for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()): self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)' indicates that the current implementation does not check if 'v' (the hook function) is a list and simply registers it, which causes problems if a list is provided.
