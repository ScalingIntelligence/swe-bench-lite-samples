Specifically, the method does not properly handle lists of hook functions within the hooks dictionary, which leads to errors when the hooks are consumed. The solution suggested is to modify the Request.__init__() method to properly parse the hooks parameter, allowing it to accept lists of hook functions. The main focus should be on the 'requests/models.py' file, as it contains the Request class and its methods. It's also important to check 'requests/hooks.py' and 'requests/sessions.py' as they might contain utilities or methods related to hooks and sessions. The goal of the search is to locate the specific code sections within these files that deal with registering and processing hooks, with an emphasis on how the 'hooks' parameter is managed.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
