The current implementation only allows for a single hook function per hook type, and if a list is passed, it wraps it in a list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. The goal is to modify the Request.__init__() method to correctly parse the hooks parameter such that it accepts lists of hook functions. The provided search results contain several code spans within the 'requests/models.py' file, including the Request.__init__(), Request.register_hook(), and several other methods. The Request.__init__() code span is particularly relevant as it is where the hooks dictionary is initially processed. The code iterates over the hooks dictionary and calls self.register_hook() for each key-value pair. The register_hook() method simply appends the provided hook to the corresponding event list in the self.hooks dictionary. The current implementation does not handle the case where the value for a hook might be a list, which is exactly the issue that needs addressing. To fix this, the code in Request.__init__() should be modified to check if the hook value is a list and, if so, iterate over the list and register each hook individually using the register_hook() method. This approach ensures that all hooks provided in the list are correctly registered without wrapping the list itself in another list.",

Consequently, providing a list as a value results in the list being wrapped within another list, causing subsequent execution issues. This suggests that there is an opportunity to improve the handling of hooks during initialization, potentially including checks and support for lists.

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
