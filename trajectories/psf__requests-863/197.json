The current implementation wraps lists of hook functions into lists, which is incorrect because lists are not callable and leads to errors when hooks are consumed. The proposed solution is to modify Request.__init__ to accept and correctly handle lists of hook functions as values for the hooks parameter. \n\nInitially, no relevant code has been identified, suggesting the task is fresh. \n\nThe search results provide a deep dive into the Request class within 'requests/models.py'. These results detail the internal logic of the Request.__init__ method, which is immediately relevant as it\u2019s responsible for initializing the 'hooks' parameter and its maintenance through the register_hook method. Interestingly, the problematic behavior \u2013 where lists of hook functions can lead to nested lists and errors \u2013 is clearly evident here. \n\nMoreover, the provided context also reveals the dispatch_hook function in 'requests/hooks.py', critical for understanding the hook invocation mechanism. This function iterates over the hook functions during its calling, further confirming the inherent issue when 'hooks' values are incorrectly wrapped in lists. \n\nGiven the pivotal role of the Request.__init__ function in managing and initializing touch points for this issue, these insights convey the essence and applicability of the current search criteria. The search has been effective in finding relevant code that directly addresses the reported issue, specifically related to handling lists of callbacks in the hooks parameter.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
