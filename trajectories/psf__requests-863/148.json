The current implementation of Request.__init__() method does not correctly handle cases where a list of hook functions is provided for a single hook event, leading to errors when the hooks are consumed. By analyzing the search results, I focused on the Request.__init__() method as it is responsible for initializing the Request object and handling the 'hooks' argument. The method currently processes the 'hooks' dictionary by iterating over its items and registering each hook individually using the register_hook() method. However, it does not check if the value for each key (event) is a list and thus handles it as a single hook function, which is the root cause of the issue described. Identifying this section in the Request.__init__() method provides the necessary context to address the problem, suggesting the need for code changes to correctly parse lists within the 'hooks' dictionary. Accordingly, this section is critical for implementing the new functionality requested in the issue.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
