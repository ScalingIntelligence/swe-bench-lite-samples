Currently, the parameter can only specify one hook function per hook, which is limiting. The goal is to modify this method so that it can accept lists of hook functions as values in the hooks dictionary. The Request class within the requests/models.py file has the .register_hook() method and .__init__() method (not shown in the provided snippet) that likely handle the hooks parameter. Additionally, the Session class in requests/sessions.py uses the hooks parameter in its request method, so changes here might also be relevant. To resolve this, a search should focus on the Request class's __init__ method to modify the handling of the hooks parameter and possibly update the Session class's request method for compatibility.",

Currently, the Request.__init__ method only allows a single hook function per hook, and passing a list of hook functions causes an error. The search results do show relevant parts of the codebase, specifically the Request.__init__ method in the requests/models.py file. This method parses the hooks argument but does not handle lists of hook functions correctly. There is also a related method, Session.request, in the requests/sessions.py file, which shows how hooks are handled when making a request, but it does not appear to directly address the issue of handling lists of hook functions in the hooks argument. To address the issue, the Request.__init__ method would need to be modified to properly handle lists within the hooks dictionary without wrapping them in a list, ensuring they are callable. Additionally, considering how Session.request interacts with hooks might be necessary to fully resolve the problem if it involves session hooks. However, based on the provided search results, the primary focus should be on modifying the Request.__init__ method to accept lists as values in the hooks dictionary.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
