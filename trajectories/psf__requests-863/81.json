            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about allowing lists in the dict values of the hooks argument in the Request class. Currently, the Request class's .register_hook() method parses the dictionary it expects from its hooks argument in a way that it can only specify one hook function per hook. If a list of hook functions is passed, the code in Request.__init__() will wrap the list in a list, which then fails when the hooks are consumed. The main goal is to modify Request.__init__() to accept lists as its values for the hooks parameter.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'hooks.py' and 'sessions.py' files. In 'hooks.py', the 'dispatch_hook' function is processing hooks and already has some handling for hooks being callable or a list of callables. This suggests that the logic for accepting lists of hooks is partly there but might need adjustments in how it merges or processes these hooks.\n\nIn 'sessions.py', the 'Session' class and its '__init__' method are the primary areas of interest. The '__init__' method uses 'from_key_val_list' to process hooks, which currently does not support lists directly. This method will need modification to ensure it can handle lists of hook functions correctly. Additionally, the 'request' method in the 'Session' class also processes hooks, and ensuring consistency in how hooks are handled across different parts of the codebase will be crucial.\n\nGiven these insights, the identified spans focus on the '__init__' method in 'Session' and the 'dispatch_hook' function in 'hooks.py', as these are directly involved in processing hooks and are where changes need to be made to support lists of hook functions.",

In 'requests/sessions.py', the Session class's initialization and request method are critical, as they define how hooks are passed to and handled by the Request object. Specifically, the `dispatch_hook` function and the `request` method of the Session class need to be inspected to ensure that lists of hook functions are correctly managed.

The current handling of the hooks parameter in the Request class's initialization needs adjusting to correctly accept lists of hook functions without wrapping them in additional lists. This involves modifying the existing code in the __init__ method to check for lists and handle them appropriately, possibly adopting a similar strategy as seen in the dispatch_hook function in 'requests/hooks.py' where hooks are converted into a list if they are callable. \n\nAdditionally, the integration of these changes with the session management in 'requests/sessions.py' should be carefully considered to ensure that when hooks are passed through a Session object to a Request object, they are correctly handled and registered. The goal is to allow for multiple hooks to be specified for a single event without causing errors during their execution. This enhancement will simplify the use of multiple hooks and align the implementation with common practices and expectations in handling asynchronous actions or data processing steps.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
