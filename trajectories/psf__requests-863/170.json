Specifically, the hooks argument should be able to accept lists of hook functions per hook event, rather than just a single hook function.

To resolve this, the __init__ method of the Request class needs to be modified to properly handle lists as values in the hooks argument. The Session class also uses hooks and may need to be examined to ensure consistency and support for multiple hooks.",

            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue, the key focus is on the `Request.__init__` method in the `requests/models.py` file. The issue specifically points out that the current implementation of `Request.__init__` incorrectly handles lists of hook functions, ultimately causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. This current behavior is due to the fact that if a list is passed for a hook, it becomes nested within another list, making it uncallable as intended. This problem can be resolved by modifying the way the hooks are processed in `Request.__init__` to properly handle and store list values for hooks. Additionally, understanding the interaction with the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` is crucial as it also involves handling hooks and could benefit from similar updates to maintain consistency and improve functionality when multiple hooks are used.\n\nRecognizing the specific problematic code in `Request.__init__`, where hooks are iterated over and registered one by one, indicates a clear target for modification. The challenge lies in ensuring that if a list is provided, it is stored directly in the `self.hooks` dictionary rather than being further wrapped in a list. This adjustment would enable the efficient use of multiple hooks without the current workaround of registering each hook separately after object creation. The relevance of this change is further emphasized by the integration with session-level hooks in the `Session.request` method, which also processes hooks similarly and could adopt a parallel approach to ensure that lists of hooks are correctly handled.\n\nOverall, the identified code spans directly tackle the issue by focusing on the primary locations where the hooks processing is done incorrectly, suggesting clear areas for improvement.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
