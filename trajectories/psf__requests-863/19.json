To resolve this, we need to find the __init__ method of the Request class and possibly related methods like register_hook and deregister_hook in the models.py file. Additionally, it's worth checking the Session class in sessions.py for how it interacts with the hooks argument when creating requests.",

Currently, the Request.__init__() method parses the dictionary from the hooks argument in a way that it only accepts one hook function per hook, and it fails if a list of hook functions is passed. This makes it cumbersome to use multiple hooks from a session. To address this, the Request.__init__() method should be modified to accept and correctly handle lists of hook functions. The search results provide the relevant code spans in the Request class, specifically the Request.__init__() method and the register_hook() method. These are the areas where the modification should be made to correctly parse and handle lists in the hooks argument. The Session class code is also provided, which shows how hooks are handled in the context of a session, but it relates less directly to the immediate issue of handling lists in the hooks argument for the Request class.",

This involves changing how the hooks argument is parsed so that if a list of hook functions is provided for a hook, it doesn't wrap the list in another list and thus cause a failure when the hooks are consumed, as lists are not callable. The current implementation in Request.__init__ iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook by appending it to the hooks list. However, this doesn't handle the case where a list of hook functions is provided. The proposed solution would need to treat lists appropriately and possibly flatten them if nested lists are provided. The relevant code spans identified are within the Request class, specifically Request.__init__ and the register_hook method, as these are involved in handling and registering hooks. Additionally, the Session class and its methods are relevant as they interact with the Request class and can provide hooks.",

Specifically, it notes that the Request.__init__ method does not properly handle cases where hooks are provided as lists, leading to improper wrapping and subsequent failure when the hooks are consumed. This is evidenced by the for loop in Request.__init__, where each hook is processed individually without checking if it's a list. The solution requires modifying Request.__init__ to correctly parse hooks, accepting lists as values in the hooks dictionary. The search results confirm the presence of the problematic code in Request.__init__, and also provide additional context in related methods like Request.register_hook and Request.deregister_hook. For the Session class, the context shows how hooks are processed and passed to the Request object, indicating a broader interaction point that should also be considered for any necessary changes to fully address the issue across the session lifecycle.",
