This involves modifying the `__init__` method to properly process a dictionary of hooks where the values can be lists of hook functions. The current implementation in `__init__` and `register_hook` methods are analyzed to identify the relevant code spans. Specifically, the `__init__` method currently iterates over the hooks dictionary and calls `register_hook` for each key-value pair. There is a potential bug if a list of hooks is passed as a value, as it would be wrapped in another list, causing it to fail when the hooks are consumed.

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
