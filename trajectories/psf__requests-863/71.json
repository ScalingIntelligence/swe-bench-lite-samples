The current implementation does not properly handle lists of hook functions within the dictionary, leading to errors when these hooks are consumed. The solution requires modifying the initialization of the `Request` class to correctly parse the `hooks` argument, allowing it to accept lists of hook functions as values. This involves reviewing the `__init__` method of the `Request` class and possibly the `hooks.py` and `sessions.py` files for any related processing. Furthermore, considering the complexity introduced by session hooks, the `sessions.py` file should be scrutinized to ensure compatibility and improved usability.",

The current implementation of Request.__init__() iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook by calling self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v). If v is a list, this method will not handle it correctly, leading to the issue described. The solution involves enhancing the method to check if a hook value is a list and then iterate over the list to register each hook individually. This approach ensures that multiple hooks for the same event can be registered correctly.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the Request.__init__() method. These lines are responsible for initializing the hooks and registering them. This is the core part of the codebase that needs to be modified to fix the reported issue. The code snippet 'hooks = hooks or {}' initializes the hooks dictionary, and the subsequent loop 'for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()): self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)' registers each hook. Enhancing this loop to correctly handle lists will address the problem.\n\nThe identified code spans are:\n1. Request.__init__\n2. Request.register_hook",

Currently, the code only supports specifying one hook function per hook, and it incorrectly handles lists by wrapping them in a list which leads to errors when the hooks are consumed. The issue suggests that the Request.__init__() method should be modified to accept lists as values for the hooks parameter. Based on the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the requests/models.py file within the Request class. Specifically, the Request.__init__ and Request.register_hook methods are critical as they handle the initialization and registration of hooks. Additionally, the Request._build_response method is relevant as it interacts with the hooks during the response building process. The Session.request method in requests/sessions.py is also relevant as it creates and sends Request objects, potentially involving multiple hooks. However, the other methods in both files, such as __repr__, __enter__, __exit__, and various HTTP method implementations (get, post, etc.), are not directly related to the issue at hand. Therefore, the focus should be on the __init__ and register_hook methods in the Request class and the request method in the Session class.",

The issue specifically mentions the `hooks` argument in the `Request` class's `__init__` method and suggests that it should handle lists of hook functions. Currently, the `Request` class does process the `hooks` argument and calls the `register_hook` method to add hooks. However, the code does not explicitly check for or handle lists of hook functions, which is the primary concern of the issue. This means that if a list is provided as a hook, it will likely fail, as indicated in the issue. While the relevant code is present in the file context, the specific modification or enhancement to handle lists of hook functions is not yet implemented. Additional inspection and potential modification of the `register_hook` method or other related methods in the `Request` class would be necessary to fully address the issue.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
