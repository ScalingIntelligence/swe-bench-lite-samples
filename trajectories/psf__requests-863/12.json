This results in the list of hook functions being wrapped in another list, which is not callable, leading to a failure when these hooks are consumed. The solution requires modifying the Request.__init__() method to correctly parse and handle lists within the hooks dictionary. \n\nThe search results provide relevant code snippets from the files 'requests/models.py' and 'requests/hooks.py'. The 'requests/models.py' file contains both the Request class definition and its .__init__() method, where the problematic code resides. It also contains the register_hook() method that is responsible for registering hooks. The 'requests/hooks.py' file contains the dispatch_hook() function, which is used to dispatch the hooks. This will likely need to be adjusted too to handle lists of hooks correctly (though the issue does not explicitly mention it, handling lists correctly in dispatch_hook() could be part of the broader solution). The 'requests/sessions.py' file, otherwise, does not contain direct references to the hooks issue and could be considered less relevant for now.",

The current code in the __init__ method indeed only supports a single hook function per hook and would need modification to support lists. The dispatch_hook function is also relevant as it handles the execution of hooks, though it correctly handles lists if they are provided. The current implementation in __init__ does not correctly handle hooks if a list is provided, which matches the issue description.

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
