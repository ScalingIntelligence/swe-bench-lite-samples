These code spans are directly related to the functionality that needs to be modified to resolve the reported issue. Specifically, the for loop in the __init__ method that processes the hooks argument and the register_hook method itself are the areas of focus. These areas need to be adjusted to handle lists of hook functions correctly and avoid the current error-prone behavior.
