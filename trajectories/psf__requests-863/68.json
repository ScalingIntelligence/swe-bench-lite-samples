Currently, the .register_hook() method only allows one hook function per hook, and passing a list of hook functions results in the list being wrapped in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. To address this, the Request.__init__() method needs to be modified to accept lists as values for the hooks parameter. Analyzing the provided code, the relevant part is the Request.__init__() method where the hooks are processed. The code iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook individually. To support lists of hook functions, this part of the code needs to be updated to check if the value is a list and then iterate over that list to register each hook function. The search results include the Request.__init__() method which is the part of the code that interacts with the hooks argument and processes it. This method is the key part that needs to be updated to resolve the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
