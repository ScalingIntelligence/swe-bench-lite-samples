This makes it difficult to use multiple hooks from a session. The solution suggested is to modify the __init__ method to handle lists of hook functions properly.

            "scratch_pad": "The changes made in the diff effectively address the reported issue. The code now correctly handles lists of hook functions within the hooks parameter during the initialization of the Request object. By iterating over each item in the list, each hook function is registered individually, thus avoiding the previous issue where a list of hooks would be wrapped in a list and not callable. This ensures that the hooks are properly registered, allowing for multiple hooks to be specified per event without additional steps like creating the request object without sending it, calling register_hook multiple times, and then finally calling send. The updated code now supports this conveniently.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
