The issue states that the current implementation does not properly handle lists of hook functions, leading to errors when attempting to use multiple hooks. The requested solution is for the __init__ method to be updated so that it can accept lists as values in the hooks dictionary. The provided search results include code spans within the Request class from the 'requests/models.py' file, specifically the __init__ method where the hooks parameter is processed. This code is directly related to the reported issue as it involves the initialization of the Request object and the handling of hooks. The analysis of the code shows that the current implementation iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook individually, but it does not handle the case where a list of hook functions is provided. Therefore, this code span is relevant to address the reported issue. The additional file 'requests/packages/oauthlib/common.py' does not contain relevant code as it pertains to a different module and does not address the hooks argument issue in the Request class from the 'requests' module. Focusing on the 'requests/models.py' file and specifically the __init__ method of the Request class is necessary to address the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
