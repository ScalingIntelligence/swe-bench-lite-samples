The goal is to modify the code in Request.__init__() to accept lists as values for the hooks dictionary, allowing for multiple hook functions per hook event. This will streamline the process of registering multiple hooks and eliminate the need for creating and registering hooks separately after instantiating the Request object.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
