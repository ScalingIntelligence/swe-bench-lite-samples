This would simplify the process of registering multiple hooks, avoiding the need to call .register_hook() multiple times. The analysis of the provided search results revolves around identifying the relevant code spans within the Request class and Session class methods to address the issue. The key spans to focus on are the __init__ method of the Request class, which currently iterates over the hooks dictionary, appending each hook function to the corresponding event list. Additionally, the register_hook method is used to add a single hook function to the hooks dictionary. The Session.request method is also relevant as it heavily interacts with hooks and may need updates to correctly handle multiple hooks. These identified code spans can be targeted for modification to enable the acceptance of lists in the hooks argument, thereby addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
