Specifically, it states that the code currently does not handle lists of hook functions well and can only specify one hook function per hook. The solution proposed involves modifying Request.__init__() to handle lists in the hooks parameter more gracefully. Upon reviewing the provided search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are those related to Request.__init__() and Request.register_hook(). The code in Request.__init__() is currently processing hooks in a way that does not account for lists of hooks, which matches the problem described. The register_hook() method, while it does append hooks to the list, is invoked in a way that would wrap a list in another list if a list is passed directly in the hooks argument of __init__. Therefore, these two code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue, as they involve the exact parts of the code that need to be adjusted.",
