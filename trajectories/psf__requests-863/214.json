Currently, the method wraps lists in another list, causing them to fail when the hooks are consumed because a list is not callable. The search results contain the 'Request' class and its __init__ method, where the hooks are processed. The current processing logic does not support lists as values for hooks, directly addressing the issue reported. The relevant sections in the code are the declaration of the 'Request' class, the __init__ method where the hooks are initialized, and the method for registering hooks. This code section is essential for applying the required modification to support lists as values for hooks in the 'hooks' parameter.\n\nStep-by-step, the logic involves:\n1. Identifying the relevant code sections in the 'models.py'.\n2. Locating the 'Request' class definition which encompasses the __init__ method.\n3. Specifically focusing on the __init__ method to understand how hooks are currently managed.\n4. Noting that the hooks are processed by iterating over the provided hooks dictionary and registering each hook using the 'register_hook' method, but it does not handle lists properly.\n5. Identifying where a list could cause a failure: in the loop iterating over the hooks dictionary in the __init__ method.\n6. Recognizing that the 'register_hook' method supports adding individual hooks, but the current logic in __init__ does not account for the possibility of a list of hooks being passed for a single key, which needs to be addressed to resolve the issue.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
