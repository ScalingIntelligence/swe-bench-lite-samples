Specifically, it mentions that the current implementation does not support passing lists of hook functions per hook, which is a limitation. The target for improvement is the __init__ method of the Request class, which should be modified to accept lists as values for the hooks parameter. The relevant files identified as potentially containing the implementation of the Request class and related hooks processing are requests/models.py and requests/hooks.py. Additionally, the Session class integration for hooks in requests/sessions.py should also be considered.",

The current behavior of parsing the hooks dictionary does not handle lists of hook functions properly, leading to errors when a list is provided. The task is to modify Request.__init__ to correctly parse the hooks parameter, allowing lists of hook functions. This involves identifying the relevant code spans in Request.__init__ that handle the hooks parameter and implementing the necessary changes to support lists. Additionally, it would be beneficial to review the Session class and its interactions with hooks for potential improvements or additional changes. The search results provide the necessary context for the Request class's hooks handling, including the __init__ method and the register_hook method. The analysis of these code spans indicates that the hooks parameter is currently being processed in a way that does not check for lists, hence the observed behavior. The potential change would involve enhancing the loops that iterate over the hooks dictionary to ensure that lists of hook functions are correctly registered. Additionally, inspecting the Session class (in sessions.py) can provide insights into how multiple hooks from a session are currently handled or could be improved in conjunction with the changes in the Request class.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
