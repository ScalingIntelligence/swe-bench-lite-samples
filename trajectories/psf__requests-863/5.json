            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the handling of lists in the dictionary values of the 'hooks' argument in the 'Request' class. Specifically, the current implementation of 'Request.__init__()' does not correctly handle cases where a list of hook functions is provided for a hook. To address this, we need to ensure that 'Request.__init__()' can properly parse and store these lists without wrapping them in another list, which would cause them to fail when consumed.\n\nIn the provided search results, we find the 'Request' class in 'requests/models.py' and the 'Session' class in 'requests/sessions.py'. The 'Request.__init__()' method is of particular interest as it initializes the 'Request' object and processes the 'hooks' argument. The code iterates over the items in the 'hooks' dictionary and registers each hook function using 'self.register_hook()'. However, the current implementation does not check if the value is a list and simply adds it, which can lead to the described issue.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Session.request()' method is relevant because it constructs and sends a 'Request' object, potentially with multiple hooks. This method is where the hooks from the session are merged with the request-specific hooks.\n\nTo fully address the issue, the 'Request.__init__()' method needs to be modified to correctly handle lists in the 'hooks' argument. This involves ensuring that if a list is provided, it is added directly to the 'self.hooks' dictionary without being nested in another list. This change should ensure that hook functions are correctly registered and callable.\n\nThe relevant code spans are identified as follows: 'Request.__init__' in 'requests/models.py' and 'Session.request' in 'requests/sessions.py'. These spans include the code where the 'hooks' argument is processed and where sessions interact with requests, respectively.",

Specifically, the issue is that the current implementation does not correctly handle a list of hook functions, leading to a failure when hooks are consumed. The current code in Request.__init__() processes each hook by appending it to a list, but does not check if the hook value is already a list and just wraps it in another list, causing the error. The suggested improvement is to modify Request.__init__() to handle a list of hook functions by extending the existing list rather than wrapping it in another list. This change would make it easier to use multiple hooks from a session without needing to manually register each hook after creating the request object. The search results include the relevant sections of code in the Request class (specifically Request.__init__()) and the Session class (specifically Session.request()) where hooks are processed. The search results are relevant and complete for addressing the reported issue as they provide the necessary context and code spans for implementing the suggested improvement.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
