To solve this, the Request.__init__ method needs to be modified to correctly handle lists of hook functions.

This oversight results in the list being wrapped inside another list, which leads to a failure when the hooks are later consumed, as lists are not callable. To address this, the __init__ method needs to be adjusted to handle lists of hook functions properly.

The relevant code spans to focus on include the initialization of the 'hooks' attribute in Request.__init__ and the processing of the 'hooks' argument to ensure it accepts a list of functions.

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
