The current implementation does not support lists of hook functions, which is causing difficulties when trying to use multiple hooks from a session. To address this, the Request.__init__() method needs to be modified to handle lists within the hooks parameter correctly. Additionally, relevant files like requests/hooks.py, requests/sessions.py, and possibly requests/utils.py might need to be checked for any related functionalities. The search should focus on the Request class and its handling of hooks.",

Specifically, the problematic section lies in Request.__init__ where hooks are processed. The current implementation processes each hook individually and fails when encountering a list of hook functions. This necessitates a modification to handle lists properly and ensure each hook in the list is registered correctly. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals that the relevant sections involve the initialization of the Request object and the handling of its hooks parameter. The identified relevant code spans include Request.__init__ and the surrounding methods for context on how hooks are currently managed and invoked. This directly aligns with the reported issue and provides the necessary context to understand and potentially amend the code to support lists within dictionary values for hooks.\n\nSteps to Address the Issue:\n1. Review Request.__init__ to see how hooks are currently processed.\n2. Identify the specific lines that fail when a list is provided, which likely involves wrapping a list within a list or attempting to call a list as a function.\n3. Understand if there are any existing methods (e.g., register_hook, deregister_hook) that could be utilized to simplify the integration of list handling.\n4. Plan the modification to recursively register each hook function from a list or ensure that the hook registering mechanism natively supports lists as values.",

The analysis of the search results reveals that the relevant code spans are primarily in `requests/models.py` within the `Request.__init__` method and the `register_hook` method as these pertain directly to the handling of hooks in the `Request` class. Additionally, the `dispatch_hook` function in `requests/hooks.py` is relevant as it dispatches hooks, indicating how hooks are currently being managed and consumed, which may need adjustment based on the issue's requirements.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
