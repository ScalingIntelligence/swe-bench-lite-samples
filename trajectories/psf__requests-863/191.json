The current implementation in Request.__init__() does not handle lists of functions correctly, causing issues when multiple hooks need to be registered for a single event. Analyzing the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are those handling the hooks parameter in the initialization method (Request.__init__) and the method for registering hooks (Request.register_hook). These sections need modifications to support lists as values for hooks, allowing for multiple hook functions to be specified per hook event during the initialization of a Request object. This will simplify the process of applying multiple hooks without needing to register them separately post-initialization.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
