The current implementation in the Request.__init__() method iterates over the hooks dictionary, calling register_hook() for each item, which could potentially handle lists incorrectly if they are not flattened or treated as single entries. The register_hook() method itself appends hooks to a list, which suggests it can handle multiple hooks for the same event. However, the issue is in interpreting the input correctly at the time of initialization. The file context does not explicitly handle lists of hook functions within the Request.__init__() method, leading to incorrect behavior with lists. Therefore, there is a clear need to update this part of the code to handle lists appropriately.",

This would simplify the process of registering multiple hooks and eliminate the need for manual registration after object creation. The current implementation in `Request.__init__` processes hooks by registering each one individually, which doesn't handle lists well. The new search results provide additional context in `Session.request` where hooks are handled similarly by converting them into a list if they are callable, which suggests a potential solution. The `dispatch_hook` function in `hooks.py` also processes hooks by iterating over a list of hook functions, indicating that the system is designed to support multiple hooks. To address the issue, modifications would be needed in `Request.__init__` to check if the hook value is a list and directly use it, and possibly in the `Session` class to ensure it correctly passes lists of hooks to requests. Overall, these findings suggest a straightforward modification to the way hooks are processed in the `Request` class's initializer.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
