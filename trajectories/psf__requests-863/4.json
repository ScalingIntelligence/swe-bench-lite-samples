This issue affects the usability of the register_hook method, as it cannot be used to register multiple hooks at once during the initialization of a Request object. To address this, the relevant code spans are identified in the Request.__init__ and Request.register_hook methods within the requests/models.py file. These spans are crucial for understanding how hooks are currently handled and where modifications need to be made to support lists in the hooks argument. Additionally, the Session class in requests/sessions.py might also be relevant since it interacts with the Request class and deals with hooks. Specifically, the Session.__init__ and Session.request methods are relevant for understanding how hooks are passed to the Request object and used within a session context.",

The current implementation incorrectly handles lists, leading to issues when multiple hooks are provided.\n\nStep 2: Review Current Context\nCurrently, the Request class has a .register_hook() method, and the hooks argument in the __init__ method of the Request class is handled in a way that it can only specify one hook function per hook. If a list is provided, it is wrapped in a list, causing errors.\n\nStep 3: Process New Search Results\n3.1 Analyze each code span in the <search_results> tag.\n3.2 Identify the relevant code spans.\n- Request.__init__: This span includes the problematic code where lists in the hooks argument are not handled correctly.\n- Request.register_hook: This method is used to register hooks, which directly relates to the issue.\n3.3 Evaluate relevance of each code span.\n- The code spans identified (Request.__init__ and Request.register_hook) are highly relevant as they directly pertain to the handling of hooks in the Request class.\n3.6 Verify references to other parts of the code.\n- There are no direct references to other parts of the code that are not found in the search results related to the hooks handling.\n3.7 Identify and extract relevant code spans.\n- Request.__init__ and Request.register_hook are identified as the relevant code spans.\n\nStep 4: Respond Using the Function\n- Use the Identify function to return the relevant code spans.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
