The current implementation only allows for one hook function per hook and fails when a list of hook functions is passed. To address this, the task is to identify the code section where the hooks dictionary is processed and determine its current behavior. The search results indicate that the relevant code for the Request class, including its __init__ method, is located in 'requests/models.py'. This section notably includes the processing of the hooks argument, where for each (k, v) in list(hooks.items()), the register_hook method is called. This is the primary area of concern as it does not currently check if v (the hook function or list of functions) is a list and handles it accordingly. The current behavior does not accommodate lists of hook functions, leading to the described issue. Therefore, the identified code span in 'requests/models.py' that initializes and processes the hooks argument in the Request class's __init__ method is deemed relevant.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
