Currently, the method only supports specifying one hook function per hook, and passing a list results in a failure. To resolve this, we need to identify where the hooks argument is processed in the Request class's __init__ method and ensure it can handle lists for hook functions. Given the provided files, the main focus should be on the Request class in the models.py file and possibly the hooks.py file where the dispatch_hook function resides. We should also consider the Session class in sessions.py, as it interacts with the Request class and might handle hooks as well.",

The current implementation in Request.__init__() does not handle lists properly and instead wraps them in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed because a list is not callable. This makes it cumbersome to use multiple hooks from a session. The search results show that the Request class has several methods including register_hook() and deregister_hook() methods, but there's no direct modification in the __init__() method to support lists of hook functions. Additionally, there's a dispatch_hook() function in hooks.py that might be related to handling hooks. To address the issue, modifications will likely be needed in both the Request class (specifically at the initialization to properly parse lists of hooks) and possibly in the dispatch_hook() function if it needs to handle lists. It's crucial to see all code in a section to accurately determine relevance and completeness. Given the current context and the relevance of the identified spans to the issue, it appears that the search task is not yet complete as there's no direct code modification in the __init__() method to accept lists of hook functions.",

The `Request` class contains the `__init__` method where the `hooks` argument is processed. Currently, the method iterates over each key-value pair in the hooks dictionary and registers each hook function individually, suggesting that it does not handle a list of hook functions inherently. This aligns with the reported issue's description. Additionally, the `dispatch_hook` function in `hooks.py` checks if a hook is callable and if not, assumes it's a list of hooks to iterate over. This functionality complements the `Request` class handling of hooks. Since the current implementation does not natively support lists of hook functions in the hooks dictionary, it appears that the modification required to handle such lists is not yet incorporated.

Currently, the code in 'Request.__init__()' incorrectly handles lists of hook functions, wrapping them in another list and causing a failure when these hooks are consumed. This issue is particularly problematic because it prevents the use of multiple hooks from a session. The solution proposed is for 'Request.__init__()' to correctly parse the 'hooks' parameter to accept lists as values.\n\nFrom the current file context, we see relevant code in 'requests/models.py' which includes the 'Request.__init__()', 'register_hook()', and 'deregister_hook()' methods. The 'Request.__init__()' method iterates over the 'hooks' argument and registers each hook using the 'register_hook()' method. However, it does not handle the case where 'hooks' might be a list, which is identified as the issue.\n\nIn the new search results, we find relevant sections in 'requests/sessions.py' and 'requests/hooks.py'. The 'Session' class in 'requests/sessions.py' includes its own handling of hooks, showing how multiple hooks could be integrated if the 'Request' class support it. The 'dispatch_hook()' function in 'requests/hooks.py' is also crucial as it is used to execute these hooks, showing the actual application. However, the core issue of handling lists of hook functions in the 'Request.__init__()' method is not yet resolved.\n\nThus, we need to identify the specific span in 'Request.__init__()' that handles the 'hooks' argument to improve its behavior with lists.",

            "scratch_pad": "Given the context provided, it's clear that the `Request` class in `models.py` is where the hooks are initially processed. However, the issue also mentions difficulties with using multiple hooks from a `Session`. This suggests that understanding how `Session` interacts with `Request` regarding hooks is crucial. The `Session` class in `sessions.py` includes a `request` method that likely invokes the `Request` class and may handle hooks differently, potentially including handling multiple hooks within a session. Additionally, the `dispatch_hook` function in `hooks.py` currently only checks if hooks are callable but doesn't account for lists of hook functions. A review of this function is also necessary to ensure it can handle a list of hooks.",

The goal is to modify `Request.__init__()` to accept lists as values in the `hooks` dictionary.\n\nCurrently, the `Request.__init__()` method iterates over the `hooks` dictionary and calls `register_hook()` for each key-value pair. However, if a list is provided, it is wrapped in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed later. This is relevant to the issue.\n\nThe solution would involve modifying the way `Request.__init__()` processes the `hooks` parameter to ensure that lists of hook functions are properly handled. This involves checking the type of the value and, if it's a list, registering each hook individually without wrapping it in another list.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant files are `requests/models.py` and `requests/hooks.py`.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
