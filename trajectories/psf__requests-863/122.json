This involves modifying the `Request.__init__` method to accept and properly process dictionaries where the values can be either single hook functions or lists of hook functions. Currently, the `Request.__init__` method only processes single hook functions and fails when lists are provided, making it cumbersome to register multiple hooks. To address this, the relevant section in the `Request.__init__` method is the loop that registers hooks by iterating over the provided `hooks` dictionary. This section needs to be adjusted to check if a hook value is a list and then iterate over that list to register each hook function individually. Additionally, the `Request.register_hook` method, which is called inside this loop, may also need adjustments to handle lists appropriately if it doesn't already. The provided search results include the `Request.__init__` method and parts of the `Request` class, making it clear that the relevant code spans are those dealing with the `hooks` argument during `Request` object initialization.",
