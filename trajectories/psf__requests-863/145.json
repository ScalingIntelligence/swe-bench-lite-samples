Specifically, it mentions that the .register_hook() method and the parsing of the hooks argument in the Request.__init__() method do not support lists of hook functions, leading to confusion and extra steps to use multiple hooks. The search results include a dispatch_hook function that appears to handle hooks and would likely be relevant to the issue. The function ensures that if a single callable is provided for a hook, it is wrapped in a list for uniform processing. This approach could potentially be adapted to support lists of hook functions directly in the initialization of the Request class. Therefore, the dispatch_hook function is identified as relevant to addressing the reported issue, as it provides a model for how to process hooks uniformly whether they are single callables or lists of callables.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
