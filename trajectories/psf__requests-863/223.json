The problem is that the current implementation does not handle lists of hook functions properly, leading to issues when multiple hooks are needed. The search results provide context for the Request class in the requests/models.py file, specifically highlighting the __init__ method where the hooks are being processed. The code currently iterates through the hooks dictionary and registers each hook function individually, which does not support lists of functions. This aligns with the issue described, making the relevant code spans those that involve the hooks parameter processing in the Request.__init__ method. Additionally, the Request._build_response method is also relevant as it shows the context in which hooks might be consumed. The second file, requests/packages/oauthlib/common.py, does not relate to the hooks argument issue and can be ignored for this task.",
