The relevant code spans in the provided search results are the initialization of the `Request` class and the handling of the `hooks` argument in the `Request.__init__` method. This is where the parsing of the `hooks` dictionary happens, and where the current limitation is evident. Specifically, the existing code iterates over the keys and values of the `hooks` dictionary, and then registers each hook individually using the `self.register_hook` method. This approach does not account for lists of hook functions, which is the core issue identified in the reported issue. To address this, the code would need to be modified to check if a value in the `hooks` dictionary is a list and then iterate over that list to register each hook function, rather than just registering the entire list as a single entity. This analysis indicates that the provided code spans are indeed relevant to the reported issue, as they directly pertain to the current handling of the `hooks` argument and the limitations that need to be addressed.

The search results provided include the '__init__' method of the Request class and the 'register_hook' method, which are directly related to the handling of hooks. The implementation of dispatch_hook in the 'hooks.py' file is also relevant as it is responsible for executing the registered hooks. The provided code spans confirm the current behavior regarding how hooks are registered and initialized within the Request object. To address the issue, modifications would need to be made to these methods to allow for the registration of lists of hook functions and to ensure that these lists are not erroneously wrapped in additional lists. Additionally, any downstream consumption of these hooks would need to be adapted to handle lists of functions. Given this analysis, the search results are relevant to the issue report and provide a context for the necessary changes.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
