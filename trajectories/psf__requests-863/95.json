The 'Request.__init__' span shows how the hooks parameter is currently processed and how each hook is registered.

The 'dispatch_hook' function in 'requests/hooks.py' also might be relevant if the modification extends to how hooks are dispatched.

Specifically, the issue notes that the current implementation of the __init__ method in Request class does not handle lists of hook functions properly. Instead, it wraps the list in a list, which leads to a failure when these hooks are consumed because a list is not callable. This is problematic because it prevents the use of multiple hooks from a session without additional steps such as creating the request object without sending it and then registering hooks multiple times. The request is for the __init__ method to be updated to accept lists as values for hooks, making it easier to handle multiple hooks. Given this, the relevant code spans are the __init__ method in the Request class where the hooks are processed and potentially the register_hook method if modifications are needed to handle lists directly. The search results provide these exact code spans, making them relevant to the reported issue. Therefore, the identified spans are sufficient to address the issue.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
