This issue arises because the current implementation of Request.__init__() does not handle lists of hook functions correctly, instead wrapping them in another list which leads to errors when attempting to invoke them. The proposed solution is to modify Request.__init__() such that it can accept and correctly process lists of hook functions as values in the hooks dictionary. In the current file context provided, we see the definition of the Request class and its __init__() method, where the hooks argument if present, is iterated over and each hook is registered using self.register_hook(). The process of iterating over the hooks does not account for the possibility of a list of hook functions being provided as a value. Thus, if a list were provided, it would be wrapped further in a list and subsequently cause the issue described. The provided search results are relevant in that they show the definition of the dispatch_hook function in the hooks.py file. This function processes hook functions but it relies on the hooks being structured correctly, which the current Request.__init__() method does not ensure if lists are provided as hook values. Therefore, the search results further reinforce the need to handle lists within the hooks dictionary in Request.__init__().",
