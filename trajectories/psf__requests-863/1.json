This will allow for multiple hook functions per hook, making it easier to manage multiple hooks from a session. Given the context provided, the 'Request' class is likely in the 'models.py' file, and the 'register_hook', 'deregister_hook', and 'send' methods are relevant. Additionally, the 'dispatch_hook' function in 'hooks.py' is likely involved in how hooks are processed. The 'Session' class in 'sessions.py' is also likely relevant since it invokes the 'request' method which can take 'hooks' as an argument. Therefore, searching in these specific files for the 'Request' class and related methods as well as the 'dispatch_hook' function should help in identifying the relevant code to address the issue.",

Specifically, it mentions that when a list of hook functions is provided for a hook, the code in Request.__init__() wraps the list in a list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. This issue makes it cumbersome to use multiple hooks from a session without manually registering each hook after creating the request object. To address this, the Request.__init__() method needs to be modified to accept and handle lists of hook functions properly. The search results provide relevant context in the form of the Request class definition, particularly the __init__() method and the register_hook() method, which are directly involved in the registration and handling of hooks. These sections of the code are critical to understand and modify to implement the desired functionality. Additionally, the dispatch_hook function in the hooks.py file is relevant as it is responsible for invoking the registered hooks. Having identified these key parts of the code, the task now involves a detailed analysis and modification of the __init__() method in the Request class to correctly parse dictionaries with lists as values for hooks.",

This will allow for multiple hook functions per hook, making it easier to manage multiple hooks from a session. Given the context provided, the 'Request' class is likely in the 'models.py' file, and the 'register_hook', 'deregister_hook', and 'send' methods are relevant. Additionally, the 'dispatch_hook' function in 'hooks.py' is likely involved in how hooks are processed. The 'Session' class in 'sessions.py' is also likely relevant since it invokes the 'request' method which can take 'hooks' as an argument. Therefore, searching in these specific files for the 'Request' class and related methods as well as the 'dispatch_hook' function should help in identifying the relevant code to address the issue.",
