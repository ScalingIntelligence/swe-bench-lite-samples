The hooks dictionary is initialized in Request.__init__(), and the for loop iterating over hooks.items() indicates that it accepts a dictionary of hooks. This setup currently does not accommodate lists for hook values directly, which is the core issue described. However, the register_hook method can append hooks to the list, indicating that the primary change needed is in the handling of the hooks parameter in Request.__init__().

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
