To fix this, the method needs to be modified to accept and correctly process lists of hook functions for each event. Given the current context, relevant code has been identified, but the specific modification required to accept lists of hook functions within the __init__ method is not present.

The current implementation of Request.__init__() incorrectly handles lists of hook functions by wrapping them in another list, causing a failure when consumed. This problem can be solved by adjusting the handling of the hooks parameter in Request.__init__() to properly manage lists of hook functions. The search results include a relevant code span in the __init__ method of the Request class that currently processes the hooks incorrectly by considering them one layer too deep if they are lists. It also includes the register_hook method which is directly related to handling hooks. These two snippets are therefore relevant to the issue and suggest where changes need to be made to allow lists of hook functions to be processed correctly.",

The `__init__` method is responsible for setting up the hooks dictionary and registering them. The `register_hook` method is used to add hooks to the events in the hooks dictionary. We should focus our search on the `dispatch_hook` function, which is imported from `requests/hooks.py`, as it is responsible for invoking the hooks during the request lifecycle. Additionally, we should look for any other functions or methods in the `requests` directory that might be involved in hook management or event dispatching, such as handling hook calls before or after sending a request. We should also pay attention to the place where hooks are being invoked, such as in the `send` method of the `Request` class, within `models.py`. It is clear from the context that the current implementation does not support lists of hook functions per event directly in the `Request.__init__()`.
