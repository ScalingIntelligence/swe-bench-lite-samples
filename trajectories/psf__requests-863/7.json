Specifically, the .register_hook() method currently only accepts a single hook function per hook, which is problematic when multiple hooks are needed. The solution would involve modifying the Request.__init__() method to correctly parse the hooks parameter, allowing it to accept lists of hook functions. Given the context, we need to search for the Request class and the .register_hook() method primarily in the models.py file. Additionally, it's worth checking the hooks.py file since it likely contains the hook dispatch logic.",

This would simplify the process of registering multiple hooks per event without needing to call .register_hook() multiple times. The current implementation of Request.__init__() processes the hooks argument but incorrectly handles lists, which are supported structures for this kind of functionality. The relevant code spans include the method def __init__() and specifically the part where hooks are processed and registered. The evaluation also shows that the hooks are managed in a dictionary and registered through a method. Therefore, the code spans related to hook registration and processing in the __init__ method are crucial for addressing the issue. However, only Request class's __init__ and related methods are provided in the search results, which are sufficient to address the modification needed. The processing of hooks in __init__ (span id='Request.__init__') should be adapted to handle lists correctly, avoiding the current behavior of wrapping lists in lists. Additionally, no other part of the codebase seems referenced for this modification, hence we can focus on enhancing the existing implementation.",

This issue is detailed further in the search results, where the `__init__` method of the Request class initializes the hooks as a dictionary and then iterates over the provided hooks to register them using the `self.register_hook` method. The relevance of this code snippet lies in its direct handling of the hooks parameter and its methods, which are key to resolving the reported issue of allowing lists in the dict values of the hooks argument. Additionally, the snippet includes the `register_hook` method, which appends hooks to the lists of hooks per event, highlighting the mechanism currently used to manage hooks. This code is crucial for understanding how to modify the hooks handling to support a list of hook functions per event. The provided code spans involving the hooks initialization and modification can serve as the basis for implementing the desired changes, ensuring that the Request class can handle and process a list of hook functions per event. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue and form the necessary context for implementing the required functionality.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
