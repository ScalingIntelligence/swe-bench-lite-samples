This would simplify the process of registering multiple hooks. The current implementation in `Request.__init__` only handles single hook functions, which is inadequate for scenarios requiring multiple hooks from a session. The issue also mentions the need to avoid wrapping lists within lists, which currently causes errors when consuming hooks. The analysis of the provided code spans focuses on the `Request` class, particularly the `__init__` and `register_hook` methods. The `__init__` method iterates over the provided hooks and registers them individually. However, it does not account for the possibility of receiving a list of hooks for a single event, which is the primary issue we need to address. The `register_hook` method simply appends the hook to the list of hooks for a given event. The new search results from `sessions.py` reveal the `Session.request` method, which also handles hooks. This method initializes a request and merges session hooks with local hooks, which could potentially handle multiple hooks if the `Request` class is modified to accommodate lists of hooks. The identified code spans in `models.py` and `sessions.py` are relevant to the reported issue, as they involve the handling and registration of hooks, which need to be updated to support lists of hook functions.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
