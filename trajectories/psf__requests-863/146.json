            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue, we need to identify the code spans responsible for handling the hooks argument in the Request class's __init__ method. The issue specifically points out that the current implementation treats each hook as a single function, failing when a list of functions is provided. We aim to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle the hooks argument during the initialization of a Request object. The <file_context> indicates that no relevant code has been identified yet. Analyzing the <search_results>, we focus on the Request.__init__ span in the requests/models.py file. Here, the hooks argument is processed, but the current implementation does not handle lists of hook functions properly, which leads to errors. Therefore, this span is directly relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the Request.register_hook span, where hooks are registered, may also be relevant as it could be where the new functionality for handling lists of hooks could be implemented. In summary, the key spans to focus on are Request.__init__ for the initial parsing of hooks and potentially Request.register_hook for implementing the list handling functionality. Both are located in requests/models.py. The hooks.py file, though it contains important definitions and functions related to hooks, does not directly address the issue of handling lists in the hooks argument of the Request class. We should also keep in mind that the sessions.py file might indirectly affect the use of hooks if sessions interact with the hooks setup in some way. However, the direct code related to the hooks list issue seems confined primarily to the models.py file.",
