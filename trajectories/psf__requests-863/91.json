It suggests that the Request.__init__() method should be able to accept lists of hook functions within the hooks dictionary. \n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `requests/models.py` file, specifically in the `Request.__init__` and `Request.register_hook` spans. These spans highlight the current implementation of the Request class's __init__ and register_hook methods, which parse the hooks dictionary and handle hook registration. The issue indicates that the current implementation might not correctly handle lists of hook functions within the dictionary, which aligns with the code seen in the __init__ method where it iterates over the hooks and calls register_hook directly with each value, potentially wrapping a list in a list. \n\nFor the Session class, the relevant spans from `requests/sessions.py` are the docstring, `Session.__init__`, and `Session.request` spans. These provide context about how Session initializes and handles requests, including the potential use of multiple hooks or configuration options. Given the current scope of the reported issue, however, the `Session` context isn't directly referenced in terms of its handling of hooks. Despite this, keeping the Session spans in mind may prove useful if the issue expands to encompass how hooks are managed more broadly across both Request and Session interactions. \n\nAnalysis of the provided search results thus far focusing on `Request.__init__` and `Requests.register_hook` (and in turn how Session initiates and processes requests), means they seem sufficient for indicative action - however viewing the wider codebase if task scope was further expanded, particularly around ensuring all potential error cases and integrations (such as further hooks distributed in other module potentials), would still be necessary.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
