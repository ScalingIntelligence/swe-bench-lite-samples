Specifically, the issue states that if a list of hook functions is passed for a hook, the code currently wraps this list in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed because a list is not callable. This problem makes it inconvenient to use multiple hooks, and the suggested solution is for the Request.__init__() method to parse the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as its values.\n\nIn the Session class within 'requests/sessions.py', the __init__ method and the request method both interact with the hooks parameter and use the from_key_val_list function to parse it. This function may be the source of the current behavior where lists are wrapped in lists. Additionally, in the `Request` class within 'requests/models.py', the __init__ method and the register_hook method also deal with hooks directly. These sections of code need to be carefully reviewed and potentially modified to handle lists of hook functions correctly.\n\nThe `Session.request` method builds the arguments dictionary for the Request class and includes the hooks parameter. This method appears to be where the hooks are prepared for use, and it could be modified to check if the hooks are lists and flatten them or handle them in a manner that accepts lists.\n\nLastly, in 'requests/hooks.py', the dispatch_hook function is responsible for executing the hooks. This function checks if the hooks are callable or not, and this behavior may need adjustment or additional checks to handle lists of hook functions.\n\nThese sections of code are highly relevant as they directly involve the handling and execution of hooks, which is the core of the reported issue.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
