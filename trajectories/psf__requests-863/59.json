Currently, the code only supports one hook function per hook, and passing a list of hook functions results in the list being wrapped in a list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. The relevant sections of code are identified in requests/models.py and requests/hooks.py. In models.py, specifically in the Request class's __init__ method, there is a loop that registers hooks by appending each hook to the self.hooks dictionary. This loop does not check for lists and would need modification to support lists of hook functions. Additionally, in hooks.py, the dispatch_hook function handles the hook dispatching. The function currently checks if the hooks exist and iterates over them, calling each one. The identified sections of code need to be updated to accommodate lists as values in the hooks dictionary.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
