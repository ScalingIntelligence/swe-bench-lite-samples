The current implementation in Request.__init__() does not handle lists well, causing issues when multiple hook functions are provided. The relevant code spans are found in the Request.__init__() method where the hooks argument is processed and in the register_hook() method where hooks are registered. The analysis of the code shows that the hooks argument is processed by iterating over its items and registering each hook individually. This approach fails when a list of hook functions is provided instead of a single function. To address the issue, the Request.__init__() method needs to be modified to check if the hook value is a list and register each hook function within that list.

However, the immediate issue could be in how the 'hooks' parameter is initially handled, where it doesn't check for lists and might wrap them in another list. To address the reported issue, one should check and validate the type of each hook value within the __init__ method to ensure nested lists are not created when a list of hook functions is provided.
