Specifically, it points out that the current implementation in Request.__init__() method does not correctly handle lists of hook functions, leading to errors when these hooks are consumed. This issue also highlights a potential complexity in managing multiple hooks from a session, suggesting that the current approach is cumbersome. The ideal solution, as described, is to modify the parsing of the hooks parameter in Request.__init__() to accept lists as its values, thereby simplifying the process of adding multiple hooks. After reviewing the provided search results, I found relevant code spans in 'requests/models.py' primarily in the 'Request.__init__()' method where the hooks are being initialized and processed. This is the exact location where the issue's proposed changes should be implemented. Additionally, there are also relevant sections in 'requests/hooks.py' particularly in the 'dispatch_hook' function which is responsible for calling hook functions. These sections are crucial as they provide context on how hooks are currently handled, which can guide the changes needed to support lists of hook functions. 'requests/sessions.py' contains the Session class, which provides a context on how sessions currently handle hooks and could be a further reference where the new functionality could impact.",

This setup does not support passing lists of hook functions, leading to the issue described where a list of hook functions is wrapped in a list and fails when the hooks are consumed. Additionally, in the Session class, the request method also interacts with hooks, but it doesn't specifically address the handling of multiple hooks.

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
