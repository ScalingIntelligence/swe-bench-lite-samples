The current behavior wraps a list in another list, which leads to a failure because a list is not callable. The desired functionality is for the Request.__init__() method to parse the 'hooks' parameter in a way that it accepts lists as its values.\n\nThe provided search result contains a code span from the 'requests/hooks.py' file, specifically the dispatch_hook function. This function is relevant because it deals with the handling of hooks and already checks if the hook is callable before iterating over it. This suggests that the functionality to handle multiple hooks is partially in place but not fully integrated for initialization in the Request.__init__() method. Therefore, this code span is likely part of the solution to address the reported issue by supporting lists of hook functions during the initialization of the Request class.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
