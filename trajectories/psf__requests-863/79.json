Specifically, the current implementation fails when a list of hook functions is passed because it wraps the list in another list, causing a type error when the hooks are called. To address this, we need to modify the way the hooks are processed in the __init__ method. We should check if the value of each hook is a list and if so, append each item in the list to the hooks dictionary instead of appending the entire list as a single item. This way, multiple hooks can be specified per event without causing type errors when the hooks are later called. From the provided search results, I identified the relevant code spans in the `requests/models.py` file that handle the hooks argument in the Request class's __init__ method. I also found the `dispatch_hook` function in the `requests/hooks.py` file, which shows how hooks are typically handled in the codebase, which could inform how we might update the __init__ method.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
