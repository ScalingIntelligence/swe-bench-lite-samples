The current implementation fails when a list of hook functions is provided, as it wraps the list in a list, causing errors when the hooks are consumed. To address this, the `Request.__init__` method needs to be modified to handle lists as values in the `hooks` dictionary. Given the context, it's likely that the `Request` class is defined in the `models.py` file, and the behavior of registering hooks may be influenced by the `hooks.py` and `sessions.py` modules. A search should focus on these files to identify the exact code responsible for handling the hooks argument and register_hook functionality.",

Specifically, the issue is that if the 'hooks' parameter is a dictionary where some values are lists of hook functions, the current implementation of Request.__init__() will wrap these lists in additional lists, causing the hooks to not be callable. The goal is to modify Request.__init__() to handle dictionary values that are lists of hook functions appropriately. Reviewing the existing code in Request.__init__(), it's evident that the current logic does not check if the value in the 'hooks' dictionary is a list before wrapping it. This oversight leads to the described issue. The search results include the relevant methods in both the Request and Session classes where the hooks are handled and registered. These are the key areas where the modification will need to be applied: Request.__init__() and Request.register_hook(). Additionally, the Session.request() method could also potentially be involved in passing hooks to the Request object. This thorough examination provides a clear path for addressing the issue by adjusting the code in these identified methods to ensure that lists of hook functions are handled correctly.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
