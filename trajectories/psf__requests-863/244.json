This limitation makes it cumbersome to register multiple hooks at once and compounds the need to manually register hooks after object creation. To address this, I will search for the Request class in the models.py file and specifically look for the __init__ method to see how it processes the hooks parameter. Additionally, I will look into the Session class's request method in sessions.py to understand how hooks are merged and passed to the Request object.",

This would simplify the use of multiple hooks from a session without needing to create the request object, call .register_hook() multiple times, and then .send(). The key parts of the code to look at are the Request.__init__() method and the hooks handling within the Request class. The search results contain the relevant code spans: 'Request.__init__' and 'Session', which includes the Session.request method. This is crucial as the Session class allows multiple requests and hooks to be managed together, which could benefit from the enhancement. By examining these spans, we can identify how the hooks dictionary is processed and how it might be modified to support lists of hook functions per hook.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
