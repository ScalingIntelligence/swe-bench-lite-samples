The current implementation does not handle lists of hook functions correctly, causing errors when trying to use multiple hooks. The goal is to modify the initialization logic to accept lists in the dict values of the hooks argument. To solve this, we need to find the exact location where the hooks parameter is processed in the Request class, which is likely in the models.py file. Additionally, we should ensure that the hooks handling in related classes such as Session and possibly in utility functions is checked for compatibility.",

The current implementation in Request.__init__() wraps lists in lists, which causes an error when the hooks are consumed. This needs to be addressed by ensuring that the Request.__init__() method can accept and properly handle lists for hook functions. The relevant code spans to consider for modification include the Request.__init__() method where the hooks dictionary is processed. Additionally, the Request.register_hook() method is crucial because it's the method that actually registers hooks. The search results provide a comprehensive view of the Request class and its methods, including how hooks are registered and managed. The solution would involve modifying the hook processing in Request.__init__() to correctly handle lists of hook functions, avoiding the double wrapping issue. This would simplify the user experience and make it easier to use multiple hooks from a session without needing to call .register_hook() multiple times.",

This structure already supports lists of hooks, but the issue suggests that it might not be correctly handling lists when they are provided directly in the hooks parameter during initialization. To address the issue, it seems necessary to modify the hooks processing in the __init__ method to ensure lists of hooks are properly handled at this stage. Additionally, considering the broader context of the project, compatibility with Session and utility functions should be checked.

The issue arises because if a list of hook functions is provided for a single event, the code does not iterate over the list and register each hook individually. Instead, it treats the list as a single entity, which can lead to errors when those hooks are attempted to be called. To fix this, the __init__ method should be updated to handle list values for hooks, ensuring that each hook in the list is registered individually.

Additionally, ensuring that related methods such as `register_hook` and `deregister_hook` can also handle lists of hooks is crucial for consistency. The `Session` class and any utility functions interacting with `Request` hooks should also be reviewed and updated for full compatibility. Given the context provided, it is evident that the `__init__` method and `register_hook` method need attention. Furthermore, exploring how `deregister_hook` and `Session` class handle hooks is essential. The provided file context shows the creation of the hooks dictionary in the `__init__` method and the `register_hook` method which simply appends the hook without checking for lists. This needs to be updated to support handling lists of hooks correctly.",

Based on the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans involve the `Request.__init__` and `Request.register_hook` methods in `requests/models.py`. These sections handle the initialization of the Request object and the registration of hooks, respectively. The search results confirm the presence of these methods and additional related methods such as `Request._build_response`, `Request._encode_params`, `Request._encode_files`, and `Request.send`. These methods are also relevant as they interact with the hooks and the Request object. However, the modification primarily needs to be applied in the `Request.__init__` method where hooks are initially processed and in the `Request.register_hook` method to ensure that lists of hooks are correctly handled. The provided search results do not contain new information that significantly changes the relevance of these code spans identified in the initial context. Therefore, the task is complete with the identified relevant code spans.",

The `__init__` method iterates over the hooks provided and registers each one using the `register_hook` method. This setup currently does not handle the case where a list of hook functions is provided for a single hook event. The issue suggests that supporting lists of hook functions would simplify the handling of multiple hooks. The available code shows where the modification needs to be made to support this functionality, primarily in the `__init__` method and the `register_hook` method. Additionally, it would be beneficial to ensure that other methods like `deregister_hook` and the `Session` class are also updated to handle lists, but these are not directly visible in the provided context. Overall, the context provides a clear starting point for implementing the required changes.",
