Specifically, within the __init__ method of the Request class, the hooks parameter is iterated over and registered using the register_hook method. The current implementation directly assigns the hook function or value to the hooks dictionary without checking for lists, which is the root of the issue described. Thus, the code that needs modification is primarily in the __init__ method of the Request class in 'requests/models.py', particularly the part that processes and assigns values to the hooks dictionary. This will require changes to ensure that if a list is provided as a hook parameter, it is handled correctly and each function in the list is registered properly.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
