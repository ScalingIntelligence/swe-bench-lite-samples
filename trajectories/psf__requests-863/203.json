Specifically, the Request.__init__ method currently only allows one hook function per hook event, and if a list of hook functions is passed, it wraps the list in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. To address this, the code needs to be modified to accept and correctly handle lists of hook functions during initialization. The relevant code spans from the Request class are identified as follows: The __init__ method where the hooks are initialized and registered, and the register_hook method (although not directly shown in the search results, it is implied to be part of the class based on the description in the issue). These code spans are crucial for understanding and modifying the current hook handling behavior in the Request class.",

Specifically, the line 'self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)' where hooks are registered, is the point of concern. This code needs to be adjusted to correctly handle a list of hook functions if provided. The issue report suggests changing the way the 'hooks' argument is parsed to accommodate lists, which aligns with the identified area for modification in the __init__ method.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
