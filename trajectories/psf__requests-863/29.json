The current implementation only allows one hook function per hook, which limits functionality when multiple hooks are needed. To resolve this, the `Request.__init__()` method should be modified to handle lists of hook functions as values in the hooks dictionary. The relevant files appear to be `requests/models.py` and `requests/sessions.py`, where the `Request` class and `Session` class are defined, respectively. The focus should be on the method `register_hook`, the `hooks` parameter in the `request` method of the `Session` class, and how hooks are initially processed in the `Request` class's __init__ method.",

This is due to the current parsing of the hooks parameter in the Request.__init__ method, which only accepts a single hook function per hook and will wrap a list of hook functions in another list, causing errors when the hooks are consumed. The task is to modify Request.__init__ to parse the hooks parameter such that it accepts lists of hook functions as its values. This analysis found relevant code spans in the Request.__init__ method, Request.register_hook method, and Request.send method within the requests/models.py file. These methods are central to how hooks are registered, managed, and dispatched, and thus directly relevant to the issue. The Session.request method in requests/sessions.py is also noted, although it does not directly relate to the hook parsing issue, it indicates how hooks might be used in higher-level requests. This context might be useful if changes to Request affect larger systems.\n\nSpecifically, the relevant spans are:\n- Request.__init__: The constructor which initializes the Request object and currently handles the hooks argument.\n- Request.register_hook: A method used to register a hook, showing how hooks are expected to be structured.\n- Request.send: The method that sends the request and dispatches hooks. This shows how hooks are used during a request.\n\nThese spans provide a comprehensive view of how hooks are managed in the current implementation and are therefore key to addressing the issue of allowing lists in hook values.",

The `register_hook` method is used to handle hooks, and it has a straightforward implementation that appends a given hook to the internal `self.hooks` list for an event, which can be set up via the `hooks` parameter in the `__init__` method.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
