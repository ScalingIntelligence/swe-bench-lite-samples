The current implementation of the __init__ method in the Request class only accepts a single hook function per hook, which causes problems when a list of hook functions is passed. The issue is that the existing code wraps the list in another list, which results in a list that is not callable when the hooks are consumed. The solution proposed is to update the __init__ method to parse the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as values. The relevant code spans are those that involve the initialization of the hooks in the __init__ method and the registration of hooks in the register_hook method. The __init__ method needs to be updated to handle lists of hook functions properly and ensure they are callable. The register_hook method is also relevant as it is the method used to add hooks to the request. The other methods in the Request class, such as _build_response, _encode_params, _encode_files, full_url, path_url, deregister_hook, and send, are not directly related to the handling of the hooks parameter and therefore are not relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
