The solution would involve modifying the Request.__init__() method to handle lists of hook functions properly. The provided code shows the Request.__init__() method where the hooks are processed. The key part of the code where the issue needs to be addressed is the handling of the hooks dictionary. When parsing the hooks, the code should check if the value is a list and handle it accordingly to avoid wrapping a list in another list and making a list uncallable.
