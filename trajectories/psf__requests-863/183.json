This involves changes to the `register_hook` method and potentially the `__init__` method or other methods that handle hook registration and management within the `Request` class. Searching for the `Request` class definition and any methods related to handling hooks (such as `register_hook`, `deregister_hook`, and possibly others in the class and its related modules) is necessary to address this issue.",

The current implementation in `Request.__init__` only registers one hook per event, and it fails when a list of hooks is provided. The solution requires modifying the initialization to accept and handle lists of hook functions properly. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are in `requests/models.py` where the `Request` class and its methods are defined. Specifically, the `__init__` method and the `register_hook` method are crucial for addressing this issue. The search results include the import statements, the `Request` class definition, and its methods such as `__init__`, `register_hook`, `__repr__`, `_build_response`, `_encode_params`, `_encode_files`, `full_url`, `path_url`, `deregister_hook`, and `send`. This comprehensive context is essential for understanding how hooks are registered and how the request is constructed and sent, making it possible to implement the required changes to support lists of hook functions. The `dispatch_hook` function in `requests/hooks.py` also provides insight into how hooks are dispatched, which is relevant for ensuring the new implementation integrates seamlessly with the hook handling logic.",

In the provided context, the Request class's __init__ method sets up the hooks dictionary, iterating over any provided hooks to register them, but the current implementation does not account for the possibility of a list in the hook value. The search results confirm the behavior described with three relevant code spans in the requests/models.py file identified as 'Request.__init__', 'Request.register_hook', and 'Request.send'. These are the key methods where the hooks functionality is centralized. 'dispatch_hook' from hooks.py is also relevant as it is used to actually dispatch the hooks.",

This can cause issues when these hooks are later used in methods like `send` and `_build_response`, where they might be expected to be callable but are not. Therefore, the current codebase will need modifications to support list of hook functions properly.",
