Specifically, it points out that the current implementation of `Request.__init__()` does not handle lists of hook functions correctly and wraps them in a list, causing them to fail when invoked. The issue suggests modifying `Request.__init__()` to parse the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as its values. From the provided search results, there are two key sections of code to focus on: 1. `Request.__init__()` in `requests/models.py` - This method initializes the `Request` object and currently processes the hooks argument. It is where the modification is needed to handle lists of hook functions properly. 2. The `Session.request()` method in `requests/sessions.py` - This method constructs a `Request` object and could be a good place to ensure that the hooks are being passed correctly, especially if the hooks are coming from a session level. By reviewing both these sections, we can identify the specific code spans that need to be modified or inspected to support the new functionality of allowing lists in the hooks argument.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
