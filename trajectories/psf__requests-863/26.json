Current behavior wraps lists in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. To resolve this, we need to find the __init__ method in the Request class and ensure it can handle a list of hook functions per hook event. Additionally, the Session class's request method should be checked, as it may also interact with the hooks parameter. The hooks.py module might contain helper functions for hook handling that could be relevant. Given the context, focusing on these specific parts of the codebase should be sufficient to address the issue.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
