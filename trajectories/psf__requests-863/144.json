Specifically, it is currently unable to handle lists of hook functions passed through the `hooks` argument during the initialization of the `Request` class. To resolve this issue, the constructor of the `Request` class, `__init__`, needs to be investigated and possibly modified to support lists of hook functions as values in the `hooks` dictionary. Additional relevant code may be found in the `requests/hooks.py` file, specifically the `dispatch_hook` function, which is responsible for handling the hooks. Further, considering the integration with sessions, it's also relevant to look into the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` to understand how multiple hooks are managed in a session context.",

To address this issue, it's crucial to identify the part of the code that processes the hooks parameter in the Request constructor and the dispatch_hook function where hooks are actually executed. In the provided search results, the 'dispatch_hook' span shows a function that processes hooks and checks if they are callable. The 'Session.__init__' span shows where hooks are initialized and processed for the Session class. These are key areas to consider when trying to improve the handling of hooks with lists of functions. However, it's noted that the 'Session.__init__' part does not directly handle the hooks parameter in a way that supports lists, which suggests this might be a relevant area for further investigation or modification to meet the reported issue's requirements.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
