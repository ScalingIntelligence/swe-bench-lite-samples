Currently, the __init__ method processes the hooks argument in a way that it can only specify one hook function per hook, and it fails if a list of hook functions is provided. The search results include the relevant code spans. In requests/models.py, there is the Request class with its __init__ method and the register_hook and deregister_hook methods. The Session class in requests/sessions.py also includes a request method that initializes and sends a Request object. These methods are directly related to the handling of hooks and could be modified to address the issue of supporting lists in hooks dictionary values. Therefore, these code spans should be identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

The `Session` class and its `request` method are also relevant as they interact with `Request` objects and can pass hooks during the request process.

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
