Currently, the method does not handle lists properly, leading to issues when trying to register multiple hooks for a single event. The search results provide the current implementation of the Request class and its `__init__` method, which includes the handling of the 'hooks' argument. The method iterates over the hooks dictionary and registers each hook individually, but it does not account for the possibility of the hook value being a list.

The other file and class (Request in oauthlib) are not relevant to the hooks issue as they do not deal with the same functionality.",

The `Session` class's `request` method also needs inspection as it initializes `Request` objects and passes `hooks` to them. Furthermore, understanding how hooks are dispatched and consumed within the session context is crucial for ensuring that lists of hook functions are correctly handled without causing issues. Specifically, the `Request` class's `__init__` method needs to be adjusted to properly manage lists of hook functions, and the `dispatch_hook` function should be capable of handling these lists during the hook dispatch process.",

Specifically, it notes that the current implementation of the Request.__init__() method does not correctly handle the hooks argument if lists are provided as values for each key in the hooks dictionary. This leads to an exception when the hooks are consumed, as a list is not callable. The goal is to modify the Request.__init__() method such that it can accept and correctly parse lists of hook functions.\n\nCurrent file context shows the implementation of the Request class with its __init__() method, the register_hook() method, and partial implementations of the _build_response() and send() methods. The hooks are processed by iterating over the items in the hooks dictionary without checking for or handling lists of hook functions.\n\nThe new search results include the Session class from the requests/sessions.py file. This is relevant because it creates and manages Request objects, suggesting that any changes to how hooks are registered might also affect Session instances.\n\nGiven these contexts, the focus should be on the Request.__init__() method to ensure it correctly processes lists within the hooks argument, and possibly on Session methods that interact with hook registrations to maintain consistency across the library.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
