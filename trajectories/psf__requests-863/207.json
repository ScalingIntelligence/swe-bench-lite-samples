Currently, the Request.__init__ method processes the hooks dictionary in a way that doesn't handle lists well, causing issues when attempting to register multiple hooks for the same event. Upon analyzing the provided search results, the following insights were drawn:\n\n1. The code snippets from 'requests/models.py' and 'requests/hooks.py' are particularly relevant. The 'Request.__init__' method initializes the hooks and passes them to the 'register_hook' method, but it doesn't handle lists of hooks correctly. Specifically, the code where hooks are processed:\n\n```python\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\ncurrently registers each value (v) directly, which, if it's a list, ends up being treated incorrectly (as if to call a list directly).\n\n2. The 'dispatch_hook' function in 'requests/hooks.py' is also relevant as it's responsible for calling the hook functions. It demonstrates how hooks would be invoked if correctly set up.\n\n3. The 'Session.__init__' and 'Session.request' methods in 'requests/sessions.py' are contextually relevant as they deal with session-level hooks which could be impacted if the hooks handling in Request is improved.\n\nTo address the issue, modifications would need to be made in 'Request.__init__' to properly handle lists of hook functions passed via the hooks argument. This would likely involve checking if v is a list and iterating over the list to register each hook individually, rather than attempting to register the list as a single entity. Additionally, updates may be needed in how hooks are handled and called in other sections of the code, particularly the 'dispatch_hook' function.\n\nGiven these observations, the identified code spans related to 'Request.__init__', 'register_hook', and 'dispatch_hook' are critical for implementing the solution.",

Specifically, the issue points out that the current implementation of Request.__init__() method incorrectly handles lists of hook functions, causing the list to be wrapped in another list, which fails when the hooks are consumed. The user suggests that Request.__init__() should be modified to accept lists of hook functions directly. After examining the provided code, it is clear that the Request.__init__() method and the Request.register_hook() method are both relevant to the issue. The Request.__init__() method currently handles the hooks argument by iterating over its items and registering each hook using the register_hook() method. To address the issue, the code should be modified to check if the hook value is a list and then iterate over each item in the list to register them individually. This change would resolve the problem of wrapping lists in lists and would allow multiple hooks to be specified per event directly in the hooks argument of the Request constructor.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
