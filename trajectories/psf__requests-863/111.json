Currently, the Request.__init__ method parses the dictionary it expects from its hooks argument in a way that it can only specify one hook function per hook. If a list of hook functions per hook is passed, the code wraps the list in a list, causing it to fail when the hooks are consumed. This is an inconvenience since it prevents the use of multiple hooks from a session without additional steps. The issue suggests that the Request.__init__ method should parse the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as its values.\n\nUpon reviewing the current file context and the new search results, it is clear that the Request.__init__ method is the primary focus for modification. The current implementation directly affects how hooks are registered and processed, which is explicitly mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the Request.register_hook method is also relevant as it handles the actual registration of hooks.\n\nBased on the issue, the identified spans are 'Request.__init__' and 'Request.register_hook' in the file 'requests/models.py'. These spans directly relate to the handling of hooks and are critical for addressing the issue. The search task can be considered complete as all relevant sections of the code have been identified.",
