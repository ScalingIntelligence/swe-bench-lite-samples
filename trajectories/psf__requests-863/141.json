The problem arises when a user tries to pass a list of hook functions, which the current implementation does not handle correctly. To address this, the `Request.__init__()` method needs to be amended to accept and properly parse a dictionary where the values can be lists of hook functions, rather than just single functions. The relevant files to focus on are likely `requests/models.py` and possibly `requests/hooks.py` and `requests/sessions.py` due to their handling of request-related logic and hook dispatching.",

This would allow multiple hook functions to be specified for a single hook event. Currently, if a list of hook functions is passed, it gets wrapped in another list, causing issues when these hooks are later consumed. The request is to modify the existing code to better parse and handle this scenario. The search results provide relevant code spans in the Request class's __init__ method and the Session class's methods, which are used to register hooks and make requests. Specifically, the Request.__init__ and Session.request code spans are relevant because they deal directly with hooks and the request object construction, respectively. These sections will need to be modified to accommodate the new functionality as described in the issue. The dispatch_hook function in hooks.py is also relevant as it deals with how hooks are dispatched, providing context on how hooks are currently being handled. This information will be useful in implementing the new functionality to ensure compatibility and correct handling of the hooks argument.",

Currently, it only handles a single hook function per event, and if a list is passed, it wraps it in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. To address this, the relevant code spans need to be identified and potentially modified to handle lists in the `hooks` parameter.\n\n1. **Analyzing the Issue**: The issue clearly points out that the `Request.__init__` method does not properly handle lists of hook functions. This is a crucial part of the code that needs to be adjusted.\n2. **Current Context**: The current file context shows the `Request.__init__` method within `requests/models.py`. This method initializes the `Request` object and processes the `hooks` parameter. The current implementation is the primary focus for improvement.\n3. **New Search Results**: The new search results confirm the presence of the `Request.__init__` method, which includes the problematic section of code handling the `hooks` parameter. This is the key code span that needs to be modified to accept lists of hook functions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are:\n- `requests/models.py` - `Request.__init__`: This method includes the current implementation of handling the `hooks` parameter, which is the primary target for modification.\n- `requests/sessions.py` - `Session.request`: This method prepares hooks and other parameters for creating a `Request` object, which also involves the `hooks` parameter.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue and should be considered for the required changes.",

Additionally, the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` is involved in managing and dispatching hooks, and the `request` method is a key part of this process. The `dispatch_hook` function in `requests/hooks.py` is also relevant as it manages the execution of hooks.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
