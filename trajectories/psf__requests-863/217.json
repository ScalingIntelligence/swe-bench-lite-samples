The current implementation does not support this and incorrectly wraps the list in a list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. To identify the exact code segments responsible for this behavior, we need to focus on the `Request` class's initialization method and the `.register_hook()` method itself. Additionally, we should check how the `Session` class interacts with hooks since the issue mentions difficulties with multiple hooks from a session.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
