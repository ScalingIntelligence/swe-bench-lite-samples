The current implementation in `Request.__init__` treats the hooks argument such that if a list is provided for a hook event, it wraps the list in another list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed. The search results provide code spans that are relevant to the issue: 1. `Request.__init__` method where the hooks dictionary is processed and hooks are registered. 2. `Request.register_hook` method where hooks are added to the instance's hooks dictionary. 3. The `dispatch_hook` function in `hooks.py` which iterates over the hooks for a specific event and calls each one. These code spans are crucial for understanding how hooks are currently handled and for implementing the proposed change to allow lists of hook functions.

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
