The current implementation does not support lists of hook functions within the hooks dictionary, leading to errors when such lists are used. The issue suggests that the Request.__init__() method should be modified to handle lists of hook functions gracefully.\n\nThe provided search results contain several code spans that are relevant to the issue. Specifically, the Session class in 'requests/sessions.py' is of interest because it initializes and uses the 'hooks' parameter. The 'Session.__init__()' span demonstrates how hooks are currently being processed, and the 'Session.request()' span shows where these hooks are dispatched and used. Additionally, the 'dispatch_hook' function in 'requests/hooks.py' is crucial as it handles the actual dispatching of hooks. These sections of the codebase need to be adjusted to accommodate lists of hook functions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified in the 'requests/sessions.py' file for the 'Session.__init__()' and 'Session.request()' methods, and in the 'requests/hooks.py' file for the 'dispatch_hook' function.",

The current implementation likely does not handle lists of hook functions correctly. We should also ensure that these changes are consistent with how the `Session` class and the `dispatch_hook` function handle hooks. The `dispatch_hook` function currently processes hooks by checking if the hook is callable and then iterating over it if it's a list. This indicates that the `Request` class should similarly be prepared to handle lists of hook functions. Therefore, in the `Request.__init__` method, we need to update the handling of `hooks` to accept and process lists of hook functions appropriately.",

The issue specifically mentions that the Request.__init__() method currently does not handle lists of hook functions correctly, and this needs to be fixed to allow for multiple hooks per event. By examining the provided code spans, we can see that there are several files and methods involved: Session.__init__(), Session.request(), and Request.__init__(). The Session.__init__() method and Session.request() method both interact with hooks and are responsible for creating and sending a Request object. The Request.__init__() method is where the hooks are actually used and where the core issue lies. The hooks are passed and possibly manipulated in these methods, including the hooks variable in the Session.request() method, and the hooks parameter in the Request.__init__() method. These are the key areas where the current handling of hooks is implemented and where changes would need to be made to support lists of hook functions. The search results also include the models.py file, which contains the Request class definition and its __init__(), where the hooks are being processed, but not handled correctly when they are lists. This confirms where the changes need to be made. This analysis leads us to select the Request.__init__() code span, as this method is where the list of hooks per event needs to be properly supported, and modification seems necessary. The dispatch_hook method from the hooks.py file is also a candidate for an update to handle lists better, but modifications to the __init__() method of Request in models.py would be the first order of business. Specific to the request to allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument, the identified areas need to parse the hooks parameter to accept lists as values correctly.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
