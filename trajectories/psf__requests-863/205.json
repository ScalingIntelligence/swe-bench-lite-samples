Currently, the Request.__init__ method only accepts single hook functions per event, and the issue describes a workaround where multiple hooks can be registered one by one after the request object is created but before sending it. The goal is to modify Request.__init__ to allow for lists of hook functions, thus simplifying the process. The relevant code section is already identified, specifically the Request.__init__ and the related methods for handling hooks (register_hook and deregister_hook). The current implementation of Request.__init__ needs to be analyzed further to see how it deals with the hooks argument and determine the necessary changes to support lists of hook functions.",

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
