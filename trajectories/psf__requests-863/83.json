To address this, the Request.__init__() method needs to be modified to accept and correctly handle lists in the dict values of the hooks argument. The analysis of the provided code spans indicates the following: \n1. The code span with id 'Request.__init__' in requests/models.py is a direct match for the issue as it pertains to how the hooks parameter is being processed. This span currently processes hooks in a way that doesn't accommodate lists of functions, leading to the described problem. \n2. Despite the presence of other spans related to the Request class in other modules, these do not directly address the hooks parameter handling and are thus less relevant to the specific issue at hand. \n\nBased on this analysis, the identified span should be the focus for modifications to resolve the reported issue.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
