The current implementation does not handle lists of hook functions correctly, causing issues when attempting to use multiple hooks. To address this, the relevant code spans are identified from the models.py file, specifically focusing on the Request class and its __init__ method where the issue lies. The register_hook method is also relevant as it is directly involved in handling hooks. From the hooks.py file, the dispatch_hook function is identified as it plays a role in how hooks are processed. Additionally, in the sessions.py file, the Session class and its methods are relevant because a session might involve multiple requests and hooks, and the handling of hooks at this level could influence the behavior of Request.",

This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
