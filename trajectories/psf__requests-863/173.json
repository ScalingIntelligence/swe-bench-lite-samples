Currently, the .register_hook() method only supports a single hook function per hook, and if a list of hook functions is passed, it causes errors. To address this, we need to find where the Request class and its methods are defined, specifically looking for the __init__() method and the register_hook() method to see how they handle the hooks argument. Additionally, the connections with sessions.py might need to be checked to ensure compatibility with multiple hooks from a session. The focus should be on the models.py, hooks.py, and sessions.py files to find the relevant code to fix this issue.",

The current implementation of 'Request.__init__()' processes the 'hooks' argument by iterating over each key-value pair and registering each as a single hook. This approach fails when a list of hook functions is provided because it wraps the list in a list, creating a nested list structure that is not callable. To address this, the modification should enable the 'Request.__init__()' method to directly accept lists for each hook event in the 'hooks' argument. In the provided search results, the key sections are 'Request.__init__()' and 'Request.register_hook()'. The former currently processes the 'hooks' argument, and the latter is responsible for registering hooks. These sections are the focal points for changes to support lists of hook functions.",

  "initial_message": "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument\nCurrently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
