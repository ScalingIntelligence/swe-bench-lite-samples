Currently, the argument can only specify one hook function per hook, which is inconvenient for users who want to use multiple hooks from a session. The issue suggests that Request.__init__() should be modified to accept lists as values for the hooks parameter.\n\nUpon analyzing the provided code, the relevant code spans are identified in the `requests/models.py` file, specifically in the `Request.__init__()` method. In this method, the hooks parameter is currently processed by iterating over the hooks dictionary and registering each hook individually. This approach does not handle lists of hook functions, leading to the limitation described in the issue.\n\nIn addition, the `requests/sessions.py` file contains the `Session.request()` method, which sets hooks for the session and calls the `Request` constructor. This method also needs to be reviewed to ensure compatibility with the proposed change.\n\nTo address the issue, the relevant code spans need to be identified in both files for the proposed enhancements. The current handling of the hooks parameter in the `Request.__init__()` method and the session's request method will require modifications to support lists of hook functions.",

Specifically, the issue points out that the current implementation of Request.__init__() only accepts one hook function per hook and fails if a list of hook functions is passed. This is problematic because it doesn't allow multiple hooks from a session to be used conveniently. The solution proposed is to modify Request.__init__() to accept lists of hook functions. The provided search results do contain relevant code spans, notably in the Request.__init__() method where the hooks dictionary is iterated over and each hook is registered. This is exactly where the potential change is needed, particularly where the hooks argument is processed. Additionally, the register_hook method is also relevant since it is used to append hooks, implying that this method might need to be adjusted to handle lists of hook functions more gracefully if the proposed change is implemented. Furthermore, the from_key_val_list function from utils.py might be relevant for potentially modifying how hook dictionaries are handled, though it currently doesn't directly deal with lists within its input.",
