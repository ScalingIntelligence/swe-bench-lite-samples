Specifically, the issue points out that if a list of hook functions is passed for a hook, the current code in Request.__init__() wraps the list in a list, causing a failure when the hooks are consumed because a list is not callable. From the search results, it's clear that the hooks parameter is being processed in the Session class, particularly in the __init__() and request() methods. The problem seems to originate from the way hooks are handled in these methods using the from_key_val_list() function, which might be incorrectly parsing lists. To resolve this issue, we need to identify where exactly this parsing happens and adjust it to correctly handle lists of hook functions. The relevant code spans identified here are in the Session.__init__ and Session.request methods where the hooks parameter is used and potentially misparsed.",

The current implementation in `Session.__init__` and `Session.request` uses `from_key_val_list` to handle the `hooks` parameter, which does not support lists of hook functions. By analyzing the `Session.__init__` and `Session.request` methods, we can identify the relevant spans where the `hooks` parameter is processed and where the change should be implemented to support lists. This will enable the `Request` class to accept lists of hook functions, thereby addressing the issue described. The relevant code spans are those that handle the `hooks` parameter and the subsequent use of these hooks within the `request` method.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
