Specifically, it notes that the current implementation does not allow lists of hook functions to be passed in the `hooks` argument directly, which leads to errors when the hooks are consumed. The suggestion is to modify the `__init__` method to accept lists of hook functions as values in the `hooks` dictionary. The provided search results contain the relevant code spans for the `Request` class, including the `__init__` method and the `register_hook` method. These code spans are directly related to the reported issue as they deal with the initialization and management of hooks.

If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n"
