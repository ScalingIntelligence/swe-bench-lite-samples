Specifically, the issue arises when filtering on a query result that overrides the GROUP BY clause of an internal query. The relevant code spans are found in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. In `query.py`, the `build_filter` method handles the construction of filter conditions, which might be where the GROUP BY issue originates. Additionally, the `set_group_by` method explicitly sets the GROUP BY clause, indicating potential interaction points. In `compiler.py`, the `get_group_by` method compiles the GROUP BY clause for SQL generation, which is critical for ensuring the correct SQL is produced. These methods are key to understanding how Django constructs and applies GROUP BY clauses and how filters might interfere with this process.",
