This behavior is problematic as it changes the intended grouping criterion from 'email' to 'id'. The search results provide code spans from Django's ORM that handle query composition and SQL generation, which are highly relevant to the issue. I have identified several key code spans that impact the handling of subqueries, filtering, and GROUP BY clauses. These include methods like `Query.build_filter`, `SQLCompiler.get_group_by`, `Query.resolve_expression`, and `SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by`. All these functions play crucial roles in how Django constructs SQL queries and handles subqueries. Notably, the `Query.build_filter` method is central to the filter logic applied to the query, which could be where the issue arises. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` and `SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by` methods are responsible for managing the GROUP BY clause, which is directly impacted by the filtering behavior described in the issue. These methods will need closer inspection to understand how subqueries and filters interact with the GROUP BY clause during SQL generation. Overall, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of where the issue might be occurring within Django's ORM logic, and are sufficient to proceed with further investigation and potential fixes.",
