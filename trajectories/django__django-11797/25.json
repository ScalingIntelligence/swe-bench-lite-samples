Specifically, it appears that the 'GROUP BY' clause is being overridden or incorrectly applied when a subquery is involved. The relevant files and methods to investigate include the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py, especially the build_filter and set_group_by methods which might handle the construction of filters and the application of the GROUP BY clause. Additionally, the SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py and its get_group_by method should be examined to ensure that the GROUP BY clause is correctly applied when SQL is compiled. Finally, the QuerySet class in django/db/models/query.py with its annotate method, which is used in the provided example, could also be relevant.",
