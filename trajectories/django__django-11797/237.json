The key files to investigate are those related to query construction, aggregation, and subqueries. The primary focus should be on the methods responsible for building queries, handling group by clauses, and processing subqueries. The 'set_group_by', 'build_filter', 'resolve_expression', and 'get_group_by' methods are likely places to start. Additionally, the 'FILTER' operation on subqueries and how they interact with the main query needs to be examined.",

The issue specifically involves the handling of GROUP BY clauses in nested queries and the potential for these to be overridden or misinterpreted. The main focus should be on the `SQLCompiler` class and its methods related to grouping and subquery handling.\n\nRelevant methods in `SQLCompiler` include `get_group_by`, `collapse_group_by`, `as_subquery_condition`, and possibly `get_order_by` if the order of operations impacts the group by clause. Additionally, looking at the `Query` class method `set_group_by` would be beneficial to understand how the query level group by is managed and potentially modified.\n\nFurther, the `Aggregate` class and its methods such as `resolve_expression` and `as_sql` are important as they deal with SQL aggregation functions which is central to the reported issue where grouping misbehaviors are inferred with aggregation use cases.\n\nThe `QuerySet` class method `aggregate` is also of high interest since it directly involves the aggregation and checks done on the arguments passed to this method. Any miscalculations or override potential in these areas could be contributing to the issue reported.\n\nIt's worth noting the presence of `SubqueryConstraint` in `where.py`, which though not directly quoted in the issue, can affect how subqueries handle constraints which could indirectly influence how GROUP BY is applied in nested scenarios.",
