Specifically, it seems to be an issue when using the `filter` method followed by `annotate` and then trying to use the result in another query. The focus should be on the `Query` class and related methods that could affect how GROUP BY clauses are processed and combined when creating subqueries or chaining query methods. Given the complexity of the issue, it's also important to look at how the SQL is compiled and how aggregates are handled.",
