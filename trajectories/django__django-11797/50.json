The problem occurs when trying to use a filtered result with an annotated aggregation, leading to incorrect SQL generation. The relevant files suggest that the issue might be within the `Query`, `SQLCompiler`, `QuerySet`, or `Aggregate` classes, particularly where group by operations are handled and SQL is compiled. The search should focus on these classes and methods to locate the exact spot causing the override or miscalculation of the GROUP BY clause.",

The analysis of the code spans reveals several relevant functions and methods that might be responsible for handling the `GROUP BY` clause and query filtering. Specifically, the `get_group_by` method in `SQLCompiler` is responsible for constructing the `GROUP BY` clause based on the query's group_by attribute. Additionally, the `set_group_by` method in the `Query` class also manipulates the group_by clause. Furthermore, the `get_order_by` method in `SQLCompiler` and `resolve_expression` in `Query` are responsible for handling ordering and resolving expressions, respectively, which could impact how the `GROUP BY` clause is affected by other query components such as filters or slices. The `is_sliced` property in `Query` and the `can_filter` method also play a role in determining whether a query has been sliced, which could potentially affect the `GROUP BY` clause. Given these findings, the relevant code spans related to handling the `GROUP BY` clause, query slicing, and expression resolution should be further investigated to understand how they might be contributing to the reported issue.",
