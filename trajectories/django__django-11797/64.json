The error occurs when attempting to filter a query result that contains an internal query with a GROUP BY clause. The query.py file likely contains the methods responsible for combining queries, setting up joins, and managing the GROUP BY logic. Compiler.py might handle the SQL compilation and optimization affecting how GROUP BY statements are compiled. Additionally, examining the aggregation functions in aggregates.py would be beneficial, as they might influence how aggregate functions are handled within GROUP BY clauses. Lastly, expressions.py and subqueries.py headers are included for breakout to handle any specific expression or subquery-related issues.",

This suggests a problem with how the GROUP BY clause is handled when combining queries or applying filters. The search results provide several relevant spans in the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' files, which are crucial for understanding how the GROUP BY clause and filters are processed.\n\n1. In 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', the 'Query.build_filter' method is responsible for constructing the filter part of the query, which might be where the GROUP BY issue could arise if the filter logic interferes with the GROUP BY specification.\n\n2. The 'Query.set_group_by' method explicitly sets the group by clause based on the select parameters, indicating that this is a location where the GROUP BY functionality is directly configured, which could be influenced by external factors like filters.\n\n3. In 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', the 'SQLCompiler.get_group_by' method builds the GROUP BY part of the SQL statement based on the query's grouping configuration. This method could be instrumental in revealing how the GROUP BY clause is altered or mismanaged in conjunction with filters.\n\n4. The 'SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by' method attempts to optimize the GROUP BY clause by collapsing certain expressions. This could also relate to the reported issue if it inadvertently alters the intended grouping.\n\nGiven these points, the identified spans from the query.py and compiler.py files seem highly relevant to the issue of GROUP BY being overridden by filters in Django ORM queries.",
