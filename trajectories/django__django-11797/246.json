This is a critical feature in SQL processing, especially in complex queries involving aggregation and subqueries. To address this, we need to analyze the code spans that handle query construction, particularly focusing on the logic for setting and managing the GROUP BY clause. We already have identified sections in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' that deal with query resolution, filter building, and GROUP BY clause management. Specifically, the methods 'resolve_expression', 'build_filter', and 'get_group_by' are essential for this analysis. These methods are responsible for parsing and compiling SQL queries, handling complex expressions, and maintaining the integrity of the GROUP BY clause during query construction.\n\nFrom the new search results, we find additional sections in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' that further confirm our focus on these critical methods. The '_get_col' function initializes SQL columns, which is a foundational step in query construction but not directly related to the issue at hand. The 'Query' class, which includes initializations and handling specific to query objects, is fundamental but not directly dealing with the issue of GROUP BY clause overriding. The 'resolve_expression' method, however, is central as it resolves expressions within the query, which can impact how the GROUP BY is handled. Similarly, 'build_filter' is crucial as it constructs the filtering conditions, which might influence the GROUP BY clause if not managed properly. Lastly, 'set_group_by' directly sets the GROUP BY clause, making it a key element in preventing its overriding. \n\nGiven these insights, we will focus on highlighting the relevant parts of these methods to ensure we are capturing the components necessary to address the reported issue effectively.",
