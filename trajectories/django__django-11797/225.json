The provided search results contain several key code spans that are relevant to understanding and potentially resolving this issue. The `Query` class initialization in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, specifically in the `Query.__init__` span, shows the initial setup of the query object, which includes the `group_by` attribute. The `build_filter` method is also relevant as it constructs the filter clause, which might be interfering with the `GROUP BY` clause. Additionally, the `set_group_by` method in the `Query` class is directly related to setting the `GROUP BY` clause based on the query's select expressions and annotations. In `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet` class and its methods like `filter` and `annotate` are significant as they are the public interface for building queries, and thus likely where the issue manifests. Finally, in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, the `SQLCompiler` class's `get_group_by` method is crucial for the actual SQL generation, ensuring that the `GROUP BY` clause is properly formed. These code spans collectively provide the necessary context to trace how the `GROUP BY` clause is managed, constructed, and potentially overridden in the presence of filters and subqueries.",
