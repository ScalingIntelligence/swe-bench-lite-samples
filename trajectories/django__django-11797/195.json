This can lead to incorrect SQL being generated, specifically where the GROUP BY clause does not align with the expected results due to filtering. The key elements to focus on from the issue description are the `group_by` and `filter` operations, particularly how they interact within the SQLCompiler and Query classes in Django's ORM.\n\nThe search results provide relevant code spans within `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. These files contain the SQLCompiler class, particularly the `get_group_by` method and the `collapse_group_by` method, which are critical for generating the GROUP BY clause correctly. Additionally, the Query class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` contains methods like `set_group_by` which are also relevant, as they set up the GROUP BY clause for the query.\n\nGiven the description of the issue, it's likely that the bug could be arising from some interaction between the `get_group_by` method and how filters are applied, possibly related to how the query structure is being manipulated before or after the GROUP BY clause is set. The `collapse_group_by` method is of particular interest because it might be optimizing the GROUP BY clause in a way that inadvertently affects the alignment with the columns in the SELECT clause after filtering.\n\nThe analysis of the provided code shows that both the `get_group_by` and `collapse_group_by` methods in the SQLCompiler class need to be examined closely. Additionally, the `set_group_by` method in the Query class should be considered because it defines how the GROUP BY clause is initialized and could potentially have an early impact on the query structure that might affect later operations.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the relevant code spans are identified from the provided search results, focusing on the critical methods that might contribute to the issue described.",
