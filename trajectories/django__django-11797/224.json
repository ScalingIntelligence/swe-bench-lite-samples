This issue is potentially related to how Django handles grouping in its SQL compilation process, particularly in the `SQLCompiler` and `Query` classes. The provided search results include several key sections of code from these classes that could be relevant to the issue. Specifically, `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` and `Query.set_group_by` are methods directly involved in determining the GROUP BY clause of a query. These methods could provide insights into how Django is handling the grouping of columns in SQL queries. Additionally, `QuerySet.annotate`, which is used to add annotations to querysets, might also be relevant since annotations can affect the GROUP BY clause. The `Aggregate` class is also included, as it defines how aggregate functions are handled in Django, which is closely related to grouping and possibly where the conflict arises. The analysis of these sections of code should help in identifying the root cause of the problem reported.",
