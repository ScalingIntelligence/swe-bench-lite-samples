The problematic query involves an internal query that groups by email, but when this query is used in a filter condition, the GROUP BY clause changes to 'id' instead of 'email'. To resolve this, we need to investigate the logic in Django ORM's query processing, focusing on the methods handling aggregation, subquery handling, and query compilation. We should start by searching for classes and functions directly related to these processes such as SQLCompiler, Aggregate, and QuerySet.",
