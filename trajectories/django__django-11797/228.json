This is likely happening in the Django ORM when dealing with complex queries involving aggregation, filtering, and subqueries. To address this, we need to focus on the logic related to query construction, aggregation handling, and potential conflicts when combining these operations. The relevant files and functions to investigate are those related to query construction, such as `build_filter`, `build_where`, `set_group_by`, `get_group_by`, and `resolve_expression`. We should also look at how the `QuerySet` class handles annotation and filtering, particularly in the context of nested or subqueries.",

The `get_group_by` method in `SQLCompiler` class is responsible for constructing the GROUP BY clause based on the query's group_by attribute. This method ensures that the GROUP BY clause includes the necessary columns. Additionally, the `set_group_by` method in the `Query` class sets the group_by attribute, which influences how the GROUP BY clause is constructed. The `SQLAggregateCompiler` class, which extends `SQLCompiler`, is also relevant as it deals with aggregate SQL compilation, particularly the `as_sql` method that constructs the SQL for aggregate queries. These spans of code are directly involved in defining how GROUP BY works in Django's ORM and how it interacts with other query elements like filters and subqueries. Therefore, these code spans are likely relevant to the reported issue, as they provide insight into the mechanisms that could be causing the GROUP BY clause to be overridden.",

The core of the problem seems to be in the `get_group_by` method of `SQLCompiler` which does not correctly handle cases where the group by columns are referenced in a subquery. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the correct columns are used in the GROUP BY clause, even when the query involves subqueries. This requires updating how the group by columns are gathered and ensuring they are appropriately considered when forming the SQL query.\n\nThe proposed change focuses on both the `get_group_by` and `collapse_group_by` methods by refining the process of collecting group by expressions and ensuring the primary keys and aliases are managed correctly. This will make sure that when a subquery is involved, the grouping is done based on the correct columns, preserving the intention of the original query.",
