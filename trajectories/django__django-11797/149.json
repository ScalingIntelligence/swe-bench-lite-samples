This problem seems to be specifically related to how Django's ORM handles nested queries and GROUP BY clauses. To debug and potentially fix this issue, we should focus our search on the classes and functions that handle query compilation and aggregation, such as SQLCompiler, SQLAggregateCompiler, Query, QuerySet, and Aggregate. Additionally, we should look for the specific patterns of nested queries and GROUP BY clauses in the codebase.",

This can be resolved by ensuring that the group by clause includes the correct field. The relevant code spans are located in SQLCompiler class of the django/db/models/sql/compiler.py file. Specifically, the methods 'get_group_by' and 'collapse_group_by' manage the GROUP BY clause for the query. As the issue describes, the GROUP BY should include the 'email' field but it's incorrectly grouping by 'id'. Therefore, we need to identify the places in the code where GROUP BY is set and ensure it's grouping by the correct fields. The SQLCompiler class handles the construction of the SQL query based on the Django ORM query. The get_group_by method is responsible for constructing the GROUP BY clause, and within it, the group_by attribute of the query object is inspected. This attribute is set elsewhere, possibly in the Query class, which might need adjustment to ensure the correct fields are grouped. In the search results, we found the relevant spans in the SQLCompiler and Query classes that could be related to resolving this issue.",
