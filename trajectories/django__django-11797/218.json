This type of issue would typically involve the SQLCompiler class and its methods for handling GROUP BY clauses, such as get_group_by and collapse_group_by. The search results from django/db/models/sql/compiler.py contain these methods, which are crucial for understanding how GROUP BY clauses are generated and managed. Additionally, the Query class and its methods in django/db/models/sql/query.py, such as get_aggregation and resolve_expression, are relevant as they deal with query construction and expression resolution. These sections of code can provide insights into how the ORM handles subqueries and aggregations, which are key to resolving the reported issue.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified focus on the SQLCompiler class's handling of GROUP BY clauses and the Query class's methods for aggregation. These are critical for ensuring that the GROUP BY clause in the subquery is correctly maintained and not overridden when further operations are performed, as reported in the issue.",
