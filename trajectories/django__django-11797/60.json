The GROUP BY clause in the internal query correctly groups by the 'email' field, but when the result is used in a filter, the GROUP BY clause incorrectly switches to the 'id' field. This suggests a potential bug or inconsistency in how Django ORM handles subqueries and GROUP BY clauses. The relevant files and methods to investigate include those related to query construction, compilation, and expression resolution in Django's ORM, such as `Query`, `SQLCompiler`, `QuerySet`, `Aggregate`, and `Value` classes.",

This problem is evident when trying to filter the results of an annotated query and the GROUP BY clause gets incorrectly set to the primary key instead of the intended column. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code in the Django ORM that handles the GROUP BY clause and filtering logic. From the search results, several key sections of code are relevant:\n\n1. **SQLCompiler.get_group_by**: This method is responsible for constructing the GROUP BY clause. It needs to ensure that the correct columns are grouped, especially when dealing with annotated queries.\n2. **Query.set_group_by**: This method sets the GROUP BY clause for the query, which is crucial for ensuring the correct columns are used when grouping.\n3. **SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by**: This method ensures that the GROUP BY clause is not unnecessarily complex but must correctly identify and preserve the intended grouping columns.\n4. **Query.resolve_expression**: This method resolves expressions within the query, which is relevant when dealing with subqueries and ensuring they are correctly grouped.\n\nThese sections of code are crucial for correctly handling the GROUP BY clause and need to be scrutinized for any issues that might cause the GROUP BY clause to be overridden or incorrectly set. Additionally, the methods related to handling subqueries and filtering should also be examined to ensure they do not inadvertently affect the GROUP BY clause.",
