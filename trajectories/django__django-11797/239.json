This problem is likely related to how Django's ORM handles subqueries and aggregations, specifically in the context of handling GROUP BY and filtering. Upon inspecting the search results, it's clear that the key areas to focus on are the methods that deal with aggregations, subqueries, and the generation of SQL queries. Specifically, the following spans seem particularly relevant:\n\n1. `Query.get_aggregation` - This method is central to how Django handles aggregations in queries, which is crucial for understanding how GROUP BY and aggregation interact. The method checks for certain conditions and modifies the query accordingly, which might be where the issue arises.\n\n2. `Query.resolve_expression` - This method is responsible for resolving expressions in the query, which is essential for ensuring that subqueries and main queries interact correctly without unexpected side effects, such as overriding GROUP BY.\n\n3. `Query.build_filter` - Filters are directly applied in queries and can affect how GROUP BY is handled. This method is crucial for understanding how filters interact with the rest of the query, especially in subqueries.\n\n4. `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` and `SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by` - These methods generate the GROUP BY clause in the SQL query. Given that the issue involves GROUP BY being overridden, understanding how these methods generate and modify the GROUP BY clause is critical.\n\nBy focusing on these spans, it's possible to trace how the query evolves from an ORM query to a SQL query and identify where the GROUP BY might be getting incorrectly modified or overridden. This analysis should help determine the root cause of the issue and identify the relevant parts of the codebase that need to be addressed.",
