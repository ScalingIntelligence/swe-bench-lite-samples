The problem occurs when the `GROUP BY` clause gets overridden by the filtering, potentially due to how Django's QuerySet and SQLCompiler handle these operations. By examining the provided code spans, I see that the `QuerySet.annotate` method is relevant because it involves adding annotations and setting group by conditions. The SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method is also relevant as it compiles the GROUP BY clause. Additionally, the `Query.set_group_by` and `Query.build_filter` methods are relevant as they handle the construction of the GROUP BY clause and filtering, respectively. These methods will be necessary to investigate and possibly modify to resolve the issue.",
