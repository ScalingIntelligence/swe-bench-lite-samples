The provided context outlines relevant parts of the Query class in Django's ORM that handle query construction, specifically focusing on the handling of GROUP BY and filters. The new search results include additional methods related to grouping and filtering. The `Query.set_group_by` method is particularly relevant as it sets the GROUP BY clause based on the query's select statements and annotations. The `Query.build_filter` method, which constructs the filter clause for the query, is also relevant, especially in understanding how filters interact with the GROUP BY clause. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method is pertinent as it compiles the GROUP BY clause from the query object, including handling for expressions not originally present in the query's select clause. The newly found `QuerySet.annotate` method is relevant as it adds annotations to the query, which can influence the GROUP BY clause if any of the annotations contain aggregates.",
