The main concern is that the GROUP BY clause is being incorrectly overridden or misinterpreted in the context of a subquery, potentially leading to incorrect query results. Given the error message and the database-specific operations involved, focusing on Django's ORM query and aggregation logic is crucial. Searching within the relevant Django ORM files that handle SQL query construction and execution, particularly those dealing with group by logic and subquery handling, should provide the necessary insights to address and fix the issue.",

Additionally, `Query.resolve_ref` and `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` are relevant for understanding how references and ordering are resolved in queries.

This involves inspecting the `filter_specs` dictionary for the presence of 'email'. If found, the GROUP BY clause should be adjusted accordingly.
