This might be happening due to how the query is being processed or constructed in the Django ORM. It looks like the issue could be in the way the 'build_filter', 'set_group_by', 'resolve_expression', or 'annotate' functions are handling or applying the GROUP BY and filter operations. Additionally, the 'SQLCompiler' and 'QuerySet' classes might be relevant since they handle SQL compilation and query operations, respectively. I will search for these specific functions and classes within the provided file context to identify potential areas of concern.",

This affects the Django ORM's handling of nested queries and annotations, specifically when combining filtering and aggregation. To address this, we need to focus on the code spans related to query construction, especially those dealing with annotation, filtering, and GROUP BY clauses. The provided search results contain several relevant code spans within the `Query` and `SQLCompiler` classes from `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. These spans include methods for rewriting columns, adding annotations, resolving expressions, building filters, setting GROUP BY, and more. Notably, the method `Query.rewrite_cols` and `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` are directly related to the issue, as they handle the transformation of query parts and the generation of the GROUP BY clause, respectively. Additionally, the `Query.build_filter` method is crucial for understanding how filters are constructed and applied, which might inadvertently affect the GROUP BY clause. The issue likely occurs due to the incorrect handling of nested queries or the order of operations in applying filters and annotations. By examining and potentially modifying these methods, we can identify and rectify the problem, ensuring that the GROUP BY clause is correctly preserved even after applying filters.",
