These methods cover the essential logic for determining the GROUP BY columns and the interaction with filtering logic. While the direct cause of the reported issue involving the GROUP BY clause being overridden by filtering is not explicitly resolved in the provided context, the context gives a comprehensive view of how the GROUP BY clause is managed within the Django ORM, including checks, expression processing, and column resolution. Thus, it provides a strong foundation for further investigation. Note that further context might be needed to fully diagnose why 'U0.\"id\"' is used in GROUP BY instead of 'U0.\"email\"' as mentioned in the issue, possibly involving more of the query construction or subquery processing code not included.",
