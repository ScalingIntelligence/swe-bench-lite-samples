The `collapse_group_by` method is also relevant for optimizing the grouping and ensuring that primary keys are correctly considered in the grouping process. In `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, the `set_group_by` method configures the GROUP BY settings for the query, and the `add_select_related` method can influence how fields are selected, potentially affecting grouping indirectly. Further investigation is needed to ensure that these methods accurately represent and implement the intended SQL grouping behavior, especially when dealing with subqueries and complex filtering.",
