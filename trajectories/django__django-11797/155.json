This suggests a need to investigate the methods and properties related to query construction, filtering, and aggregation, especially in the presence of subqueries. Key areas to focus on are the 'build_filter', 'set_group_by', 'build_where', 'resolve_expression', and 'annotate' methods, as well as the 'SQLCompiler' class and its handling of GROUP BY operations. Additionally, the 'QuerySet' class and its interaction with subqueries might be relevant.",

This issue is likely related to how the Query class and its methods handle annotations and GROUP BY clauses. Based on the search results, several key methods in the Query class could be relevant: `rewrite_cols`, `get_aggregation`, `add_annotation`, `resolve_expression`, and `set_group_by`. These methods deal with annotations, resolving expressions, and setting GROUP BY clauses, which are directly related to the issue. The `Aggregate` class in `aggregates.py` is also relevant as it deals with aggregate functions, which are used in the query's annotation and GROUP BY clause. Additionally, the `SQLCompiler` class in `compiler.py` is responsible for compiling SQL, which includes handling GROUP BY clauses. These methods and classes provide a good starting point for identifying the root cause of the GROUP BY issue. Specifically, the `set_group_by` method in `query.py` is of particular interest as it directly sets the GROUP BY clause, which might be where the issue arises. Furthermore, the `get_aggregation` method in `query.py` could also be relevant as it handles aggregation queries, which are closely related to GROUP BY clauses.",
