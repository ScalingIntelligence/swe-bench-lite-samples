The key parts of the issue involve the use of filter() and values() methods in the Django ORM, and how GROUP BY is affected by these operations. The relevant parts of the Django ORM need to correctly manage GROUP BY clauses, possibly in the SQLCompiler class as it is responsible for compiling SQL queries. The functions of interest are likely those in the SQLCompiler class, such as get_group_by and get_order_by, which control the grouping and ordering of SQL queries. Additionally, the Query class is likely involved since it manages the state and logic of queries prior to compilation. The set_group_by method in the Query class appears to be directly related to setting the GROUP BY clause of a query, which is likely where the issue of overriding might occur.",
