This problem is likely related to how Django's ORM handles subquery filtering and annotations. The relevant classes and methods to investigate would be `Query`, `build_filter`, and possibly `SQLCompiler`. From the search results, the `Query` class and its `__init__` method, which initializes the query object with various parameters including `group_by`, are relevant. The `build_filter` method, which constructs the filter clause for the query, also seems pertinent as it deals with resolving filter expressions and managing joins and conditions. In `SQLCompiler`, the `get_group_by` method is of interest because it specifically relates to constructing the GROUP BY clause in the SQL query, which is the core of the reported issue. Overall, these code spans from the `query.py` and `compiler.py` files should be examined to understand how the GROUP BY clause is managed and potentially overridden by the filtering in subqueries.",
