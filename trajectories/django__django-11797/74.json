This problem is particularly evident when using the `.annotate()` method combined with `.values()` and filtering. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that might affect this behavior. From the search results, the following key areas seem pertinent: 1. 'SQLCompiler.get_group_by' and 'SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by' in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py': These methods handle the logic for constructing the GROUP BY clause in SQL queries, which is crucial for our issue. 2. 'Query.set_group_by' in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py': This method is responsible for setting the GROUP BY clause based on the query's select and annotation parameters. It directly influences how Django constructs the SQL query, which is central to our issue. 3. 'QuerySet.annotate' in 'django/db/models/query.py': This method is used to add annotations to a QuerySet, which can include aggregate functions. Understanding how it interacts with the GROUP BY clause is important. Given these areas, I will proceed to identify the exact code spans that are most relevant to the reported issue. These spans will be selected based on their direct involvement in handling GROUP BY clauses and filtering.",
