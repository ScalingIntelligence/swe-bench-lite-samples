Given the detailed stack trace and description, we should focus our search on the core query construction and compilation logic within Django's ORM, specifically looking at the `Query`, `SQLCompiler`, and related classes where query generation and aggregation handling are critical. We should also consider querying for specific method names and class definitions that deal with query aggregation and grouping to ensure we capture all relevant code aspects.",

This issue is specific to the SQLCompiler class in Django's ORM. By analyzing the provided search results, I can see that the `SQLCompiler` class has methods related to grouping and ordering, which are crucial for understanding and resolving this issue.\n\n1. **Relevance of Spans:**\n   - `SQLCompiler.get_group_by`: This method constructs the GROUP BY clause. It processes the expressions to be included in the GROUP BY clause, including those from the select and order by clauses.\n   - `SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by`: This method optimizes the GROUP BY clause by ensuring that primary keys are handled correctly.\n   - `SQLCompiler.get_order_by`: This method constructs the ORDER BY clause, which can affect the GROUP BY clause if ordering and grouping conflict.\n   - `SQLCompiler.get_extra_select`: This method manages additional select elements, which might also intervene with GROUP BY if not handled correctly.\n\n2. **Analysis:**\n   - The issue might arise from mismanagement of expressions in the GROUP BY clause, especially when filtering is applied. The `get_group_by` method directly manages what goes into the GROUP BY clause, so any discrepancies in how it handles the selected values or filters could lead to the overriding issue.\n   - The `collapse_group_by` method suggests a mechanism to potentially avoid unnecessary grouping, which could mean it plays a role in how generously grouping is applied.\n   - The `get_order_by` method is also relevant since ordering can influence grouping, especially in complex queries involving subqueries.\n\nBy examining these spans, I can identify direct relevance based on their involvement in dealing with GROUP BY constructs, and their potential roles in managing select and order operations that potentially might influence the overrided GROUP BY issue described.\n\n",
