Specifically, it notes that when a query involving aggregation and GROUP BY is nested within another query, the GROUP BY clause seems to be ignored or incorrectly applied. The search results have provided insights into the inner workings of the Django ORM, specifically focusing on the Query class. Within this class, the methods `set_group_by` and `add_select_related` are particularly relevant. The `set_group_by` method is responsible for setting the GROUP BY clause based on the selected fields, which directly aligns with the issue described. The method iterates through the selected fields and annotations to determine which columns should be grouped. This logic is crucial to ensure that the GROUP BY clause is correctly applied in all query contexts, including nested ones. The `add_select_related` method, although not directly related to GROUP BY, is included for completeness, as it deals with related fields, which could also be a factor in complex queries.",
