This suggests potential issues in how Django handles SQL query construction and especially how it processes `GROUP BY` and `filter` operations. The provided spans in `query.py` demonstrate key functions like `set_group_by` and `build_filter`. `set_group_by` is crucial for defining the `GROUP BY` clause, while `build_filter` is responsible for constructing SQL filters which might interact or interfere with the `GROUP BY` specification. In `compiler.py`, the `get_group_by` method and `collapse_group_by` are highlighted, which show how the compiler processes the group by expressions, which is critical for addressing the issue. Identifying relevant code spans from these sections can help in understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.
