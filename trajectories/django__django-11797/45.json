The stack trace and the specific lines of code where the error occurs suggest that the problem might be rooted in the `Query`, `SQLCompiler`, `QuerySet`, `Aggregate`, or `Expression` classes in Django's ORM. The goal is to find the methods or parts of these classes where the GROUP BY logic is handled or overridden by filters, particularly where it might be causing the GROUP BY clause to be incorrectly applied. The search should focus on the methods related to building filters, resolving expressions, setting up joins, and managing selects and group bys.",
