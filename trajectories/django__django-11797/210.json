Specifically, the problem occurs when the outer query refers to a field that should be grouped in the subquery but is instead referred to its primary key. This discrepancy leads to incorrect SQL generation where the GROUP BY clause in the subquery refers to the primary key rather than the intended field.\n\nAfter analyzing the search results, the following key areas seem relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **Query.build_filter (span_id='Query.build_filter')**: This method constructs the SQL filter conditions and handles subqueries. It's likely where the incorrect reference to the primary key instead of the 'email' field is happening.\n\n2. **Query.set_group_by (span_id='Query.set_group_by')**: This method sets the GROUP BY clause based on the selected fields and annotations. Understanding how it resolves fields for grouping will be crucial in identifying how the 'email' field might be overlooked.\n\n3. **SQLCompiler.get_group_by (span_id='SQLCompiler.get_group_by')**: This method is responsible for generating the actual GROUP BY SQL clause. By ensuring that the correct fields are included here, we can address the issue where the subquery's GROUP BY might not be correctly aligned with the intended fields.\n\n4. **QuerySet.annotate (span_id='QuerySet.annotate')**: While the primary issue lies in the SQL generation, understanding how annotations interact with the query setup could provide insights into whether complex annotations might indirectly affect or expose the GROUP BY issue.\n\nThese sections of code are foundational to understanding and fixing the problem described in the reported issue by examining the logic around subquery handling, filter construction, and the generation of the GROUP BY clause.",
