The key areas to investigate would be the query execution path, especially around how filters and subqueries are processed in relation to GROUP BY clauses. Relevant files could include those handling query compilation, aggregation, and expression resolution, such as django/db/models/sql/query.py, django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, and django/db/models/aggregates.py. Given the error specifically mentions 'GROUP BY U0.\"id\" should be GROUP BY U0.\"email\"', focusing on methods that handle grouping and subqueries like 'get_group_by' and 'build_filter' in these files would be prudent.",

The search results include relevant methods such as `build_filter` and `set_group_by` in the `Query` class from `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

The `build_filter` method resolves lookup values and constructs filter conditions, which is directly related to the filter issue described. The `set_group_by` method is responsible for setting up the GROUP BY clause based on the selected columns and annotations, which aligns with the issue of the GROUP BY clause being incorrectly overridden.
