The issue involves managing the GROUP BY clause correctly when applying filters, particularly within Django's ORM. Based on the search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file, specifically the `Query.__init__`, `Query.build_filter`, and `Query.set_group_by` methods. These methods are central to how Django's ORM constructs queries and handles filters and GROUP BY clauses. Additionally, in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` and `SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by` methods are relevant for how the GROUP BY clause is managed and optimized in the SQL compilation process. This code provides the necessary context and functionality to address the issue of GROUP BY being overridden by filter operations. By analyzing these methods, we can understand how Django manages query construction and potentially identify where adjustments are needed to ensure the GROUP BY clause is not unintentionally altered by filter operations.",
