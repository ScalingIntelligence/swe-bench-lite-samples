The Django ORM is not correctly propagating the GROUP BY clause from the internal query to the outer query when applying a filter. The affected methods likely include those related to building filters, resolving expressions, and handling subqueries. By focusing on the methods responsible for building queries, subqueries, and handling GROUP BY clauses in the files provided, we can narrow down the problematic areas.",

Analyzing the code spans provided, the relevant files and methods that could be involved in this issue are found in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py'. In 'query.py', methods like 'add_annotation', 'resolve_expression', 'build_filter', 'add_filter', and 'add_q' are critical for handling query annotations and filters. These methods control how annotations are added to the query and how filters are built and added to the query object. In 'compiler.py', the 'SQLCompiler' class and its methods 'pre_sql_setup', 'get_group_by', and 'get_select' are crucial for the actual SQL compilation process, where GROUP BY and SELECT clauses are formed based on the query object's state. These methods handle the grouping logic and the selection of columns. Notably, the 'get_group_by' method directly deals with how GROUP BY is applied in the SQL generation. Considering these methods, it's clear that they are highly relevant to the reported issue of GROUP BY being incorrectly applied. The issue likely arises due to the interaction between how filter expressions and subqueries are handled in relation to GROUP BY statements during the SQL compilation. Thus, understanding and modifying these methods could resolve the problem.",
