The main area of concern is ensuring that the GROUP BY clause is correctly preserved when a subquery is involved and when filtering is applied. By analyzing the provided search results, the key methods of interest are `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` and `Query.set_group_by`, which are responsible for constructing and setting the GROUP BY clause respectively. These methods are crucial as they determine how the GROUP BY clause is formed and ensure it includes the necessary columns, especially when an aggregation or a subquery is present. Additionally, `SQLCompiler.as_sql` and `Query.as_sql` are important as they generate the final SQL statements, ensuring that the GROUP BY clause is correctly included without being overridden. Therefore, these methods are the ones that should be carefully examined and possibly adjusted to fix the issue.",
