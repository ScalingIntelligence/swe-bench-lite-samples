This is evident in the `print(b.query)` output, which shows the GROUP BY U0.\"id\" instead of U0.\"email\". To address this, we need to identify code sections in Django's ORM that handle query construction, specifically where filtering and grouping are applied. The search results provide three spans ('_get_col', 'Query', and 'Query.build_filter') in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file. The `Query.build_filter` method is particularly relevant as it constructs filter conditions for the query, which could be where the GROUP BY clause issue arises. The method involves resolving expressions, setting up joins, and building lookup conditions, all of which are crucial for handling the filtering in combination with the GROUP BY clause. Therefore, focusing on this method would help in diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue.",
