It appears that the GROUP BY clause should be on 'email' but is instead being applied to 'id'. Given the context provided, it's likely that the issue lies within the handling of subqueries and aggregation, particularly in the 'combine', 'build_filter', and 'get_group_by' methods of Django's Query classes. Thus, focusing on these methods in the 'query.py', 'compiler.py', 'query.py', and 'aggregates.py' files is crucial.",

The issue specifically highlights a problem where the GROUP BY clause is not correctly maintained when filtering is applied after an aggregation. This suggests that the relevant code spans should include methods that deal with query combination, aggregation, and GROUP BY clause generation.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, several spans are relevant:\n- 'Query.combine' deals with combining queries, which could influence how GROUP BY is handled.\n- 'Query.build_filter' constructs filters, which might affect the GROUP BY clause if filters are added after aggregation.\n- 'Query.add_filter' and 'Query.add_q' add filters to the query, and understanding their implementation is crucial to see how they interact with existing GROUP BY clauses.\n- 'Query.get_aggregation' handles aggregation settings which directly relate to the GROUP BY clause.\n- 'SQLCompiler.get_group_by' specifically concerns the generation of the GROUP BY clause.\n- 'SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by' handles the optimization of the GROUP BY clause which could also be related to the issue.\n\nThese spans provide a good starting point for understanding and potentially resolving the issue regarding the overriding of GROUP BY by filter operations in Django queries.",
