The search results provide relevant context for understanding and addressing this issue, particularly in the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and the `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. In the `Query` class, the `build_filter` method and initialization (__init__) are relevant for understanding how filters and initial query settings are handled, which may affect the `GROUP BY` clause. The `SQLCompiler` class contains the `get_group_by` method, which directly involves constructing the `GROUP BY` clause in the SQL query. These sections of code are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue related to the `GROUP BY` clause being overridden or not functioning as expected when filters are applied. Identified spans include the `build_filter` method in the `Query` class and the `get_group_by` method in the `SQLCompiler` class.",

The `build_filter` method handles the construction of the WHERE clause and integrates the filtering logic, while the `get_group_by` method constructs the GROUP BY clause.
