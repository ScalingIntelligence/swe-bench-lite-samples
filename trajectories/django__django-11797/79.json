The relevant part of the issue involves 'django.contrib.auth.models' being used to construct a query with an annotation and group by clause which gets overridden when used in a subquery. To address this, we need to identify the code that handles the 'GROUP BY' clause setting and filtering behavior within the Django ORM. From the search results, the following spans seem relevant: 1. Span 'Query.set_group_by' in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' - this method is directly responsible for setting the 'GROUP BY' clause in the query. 2. Span 'Query.build_filter' in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' - this method deals with building filter expressions and is critical when handling subqueries. 3. Span 'SQLCompiler.get_group_by' in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' - This method constructs the 'GROUP BY' part of the SQL query based on the query's expressions. 4. Span 'QuerySet.annotate' in 'django/db/models/query.py' - This method allows for annotations to be added to the QuerySet and interacts with the grouping logic.",
