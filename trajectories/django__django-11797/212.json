The key problem is that the internal query's GROUP BY gets overridden by the outer query's filter, leading to incorrect SQL generation.\n\nExamining the search results, several critical areas in Django's ORM code are identified:\n1. `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` function in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`: This function is responsible for generating the GROUP BY clause. It collects expressions from the query's group_by attribute and ensures all selected expressions are part of the GROUP BY clause. This directly relates to the issue since the incorrect handling of GROUP BY attributes could be occurring here.\n2. `Query.build_filter` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`: This function constructs the WHERE clause of the SQL query. The issue might involve how filter expressions interact with GROUP BY clauses, which this function might indirectly influence.\n3. `Query.build_where` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`: Another function involved in building query conditions. It's likely involved in the problem's symptom.\n4. `QuerySet.annotate` in `django/db/models/query.py` and `Aggregate.resolve_expression` in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`: These influence how annotations (and by extension, aggregations) are handled in the query building process. Incorrect handling here might affect how GROUP BY attributes are managed.\n\nThese functions and methods are crucial in understanding and potentially fixing the issue, as they directly deal with the SQL construction process involving GROUP BY, filters, and aggregations.",
