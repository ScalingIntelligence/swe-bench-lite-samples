The search results contain a class SQLCompiler from django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, which has methods related to SQL query preparation, including pre_sql_setup and get_group_by. The get_group_by method constructs the GROUP BY clause based on the select and order_by parts of the query, which aligns with the issue described. The pre_sql_setup method also sets up the query, including determining the order by and group by clauses.
