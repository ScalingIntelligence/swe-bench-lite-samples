The primary entry point to investigate is likely the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. Additional relevant classes and functions include `SQLCompiler` and `SQLAggregateCompiler` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, and `QuerySet` in `django/db/models/query.py`, as these handle query compilation and execution. The issue seems to be related to how internal queries and filtering are handled, potentially involving how subqueries are constructed and executed. The `set_group_by` method in the `Query` class is particularly interesting for investigating how GROUP BY is handled and applied. Additionally, `SQLAggregateCompiler` should be examined for how aggregate functions are compiled into SQL, as aggregates are central to the GROUP BY functionality.",
