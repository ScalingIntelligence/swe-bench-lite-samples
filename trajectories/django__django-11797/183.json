The provided search results include relevant sections from `query.py` and `compiler.py`. In `query.py`, the `Query.set_group_by` method is crucial as it sets the GROUP BY clause based on the selected columns. This is directly relevant to how the GROUP BY clause is being affected by the filtering. In `compiler.py`, the `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method is also relevant, as it determines the expressions to include in the GROUP BY clause based on the query's select and order_by clauses. This method interacts closely with the query's grouping logic and should be examined to ensure that filtering operations do not inadvertently alter the grouping. The `SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by` method, which optimizes the GROUP BY clause, is also relevant as it might influence how the grouping is applied when filters are present. Overall, these methods are central to understanding and resolving the issue with GROUP BY being overridden by the filtering in the reported issue.",
