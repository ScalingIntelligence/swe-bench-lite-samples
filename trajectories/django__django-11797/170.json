This issue is primarily related to the SQLCompiler class and the Query class in Django's ORM, as they handle the generation of SQL queries and the application of filters and groupings. Upon examining the provided code spans, it is apparent that the get_group_by method within the SQLCompiler class is central to the issue. This method is responsible for constructing the GROUP BY clause based on the expressions present in the query. The issue seems to stem from the way the GROUP BY clause is being generated relative to the selected attributes and applied filters. The code spans from SQLCompiler.as_sql, SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by, and Query.set_group_by are pertinent to the investigation, as they provide insight into how SQL statements are constructed and how expressions are handled. The other spans, such as Query.build_filter, are also germane as they influence how filters are woven into a query's structure. Without further context or erroneous examples illustrating the specific failure in GROUP BY handling, these spans offer a constructive range to analyze and identify any discrepancies. The provided search results, thus, are sufficient for reviewing the relevant code involved in applying filters and handling GROUP BY clauses in the context of Django's ORM.",

This is evident from the provided code snippets where the query structure is altered due to the filtering, causing the GROUP BY clause to be incorrectly set. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the methods that handle the GROUP BY clause and the filtering process. The provided context includes methods like 'get_group_by', 'collapse_group_by', and 'set_group_by' from the SQLCompiler and Query classes. These methods are responsible for managing the GROUP BY clause and need to be examined in detail to ensure they handle the filtering correctly without altering the intended grouping. Additionally, the 'build_filter' method in the Query class is key as it constructs the filtering conditions that might impact the GROUP BY clause. Reviewing these methods will help identify where the issue arises and how to rectify it.",
