To address this, we need to focus on the code spans related to grouping, specifically on how group by clauses are constructed and applied. From the provided search results, several relevant spans have been identified:\n1. `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` - This method constructs the GROUP BY clause based on the query's group_by attribute and other related expressions. This is directly related to the issue as it shows how GROUP BY is determined.\n2. `SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by` - This method optimizes the GROUP BY clause, which also plays a role in how grouping is applied and could be a potential place where the issue arises.\n3. `Query.set_group_by` - This method sets the GROUP BY clause for the query, indicating how grouping is implemented at the query level.\nThese spans are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue with GROUP BY clauses being incorrectly overridden. Additional context from surrounding code may also be needed to fully assess and fix the issue.",
