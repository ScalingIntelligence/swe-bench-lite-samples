Specifically, the internal query's GROUP BY clause is overridden by a subsequent filtering operation. The relevant files identified so far suggest that the problem could lie in how Django's ORM handles query construction, aggregation, and subqueries. The focus should be on the methods responsible for building and combining queries, particularly those related to filtering and grouping, as well as the SQL compilation process.",

In the provided search results, the following spans are relevant: 'Query.set_group_by' in django/db/models/sql/query.py, which sets the GROUP BY clause; 'SQLCompiler.get_group_by' in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, which constructs the GROUP BY clause for the SQL query; 'Aggregate.get_group_by_cols' in django/db/models/aggregates.py, which determines the columns to include in the GROUP BY clause for aggregate functions. These sections of code are critical for ensuring that the GROUP BY clause is correctly applied and maintained when queries are combined or filtered. Additionally, understanding how 'Query.combine' and 'Query.build_filter' manage query combinations and filtering respectively is essential to diagnose why the GROUP BY clause might be altered unexpectedly.",
