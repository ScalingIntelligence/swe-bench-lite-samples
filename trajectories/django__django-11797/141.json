Specifically, the problem arises when applying filters on query results that have been grouped. The expected behavior is for the GROUP BY clause to remain consistent even after applying filters or limits. However, the observed behavior is that the GROUP BY gets overridden or misinterpreted, especially when using subqueries. Given the context and the stack trace provided, the primary focus should be on the `Query` and `SQLCompiler` classes within Django's ORM to ensure that the GROUP BY clause is correctly interpreted and preserved throughout different stages of query construction and execution. Investigation should focus on methods related to query combination, filtering, and subquery handling.",

The search results provide a deep dive into the Django ORM's query construction and SQL compilation processes. The most relevant code spans are found in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' within the 'Query.combine' and 'Query.build_filter' methods, and in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' within the 'SQLCompiler.get_group_by' and 'SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by' methods. These sections handle the combination of queries, the construction of filters, and the determination of the GROUP BY clause. Initially, it's crucial to focus on understanding how queries are combined and how filters are built, as these processes likely involve the logic that causes the reported issue. Further, understanding how the GROUP BY clause is determined and collapsed will help in identifying where the correct grouping field ('email' versus 'id') might be overridden or neglected.",

The context also includes auxiliary methods such as `build_filter`, `setup_joins`, and `trim_joins`, all of which contribute to query construction.
