To address this, we need to look at how filtering and grouping are handled in the Django ORM. The provided search results include potential relevant code spans in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. Specifically, the `Query.build_filter` method is responsible for building the filter clauses, which might be relevant to the issue's description about filtering overriding GROUP BY. Additionally, the `Query.set_group_by` and `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` methods handle the GROUP BY clause, and understanding how these interact with filter clauses is crucial. The `QuerySet.filter` and `QuerySet.annotate` methods are also relevant as they are the public interfaces for applying filters and annotations, potentially affecting the GROUP BY behavior. After analyzing these code spans, it appears that the issue could stem from the interaction between these methods, particularly when subqueries are involved. Further investigation into how these methods manipulate the query object and handle grouping and filtering would be necessary to determine the exact cause of the issue.",
