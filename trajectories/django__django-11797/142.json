The problem seems to be that the GROUP BY clause in an internal subquery gets overridden by the outer query's selection criteria, leading to incorrect SQL generation. Given the issue description and the provided code snippets, it's clear that the problem is likely occurring within the specific functions and classes responsible for query construction, aggregation, and compilation. To address this, we need to search within Django's ORM codebase for specific functions and classes that handle these tasks, such as 'Query', 'SQLCompiler', 'QuerySet', and 'Aggregate'.",

These methods are responsible for generating and modifying the GROUP BY clause in SQL queries. Additionally, the Query.add_annotation method, which is involved in adding annotations that might affect the GROUP BY clause, should also be considered. The SQLCompiler.as_sql method, which constructs the final SQL query, is relevant for understanding how the GROUP BY clause is included in the query. Furthermore, the Aggregate.get_group_by_cols method in the aggregates module is related to how aggregates are handled in the GROUP BY clause.

Additionally, the 'set_group_by' method in the Query class demonstrates Django's approach to managing group by settings, which directly relates to the issue at hand.
