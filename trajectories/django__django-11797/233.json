This issue is likely related to how Django handles subqueries and annotations within queries, especially when dealing with aggregation and filtering. The provided search results include several key parts of Django's query handling logic such as `Query`, `Query.get_aggregation`, `Query.resolve_expression`, `Query.build_filter`, and `Query.set_group_by`. These spans are relevant as they directly deal with the construction, execution, and modification of SQL queries in Django. Specifically, `Query.get_aggregation` handles the creation and execution of aggregation queries, `Query.resolve_expression` deals with resolving expressions within the query, and `Query.build_filter` is responsible for constructing the WHERE clause, which includes filter operations that might be interacting incorrectly with the GROUP BY clause in this case. The `Query.set_group_by` method is also relevant, as it sets the fields by which the query should be grouped. These methods are likely to contain the logic that needs to be inspected or modified to address the reported issue.",

Similarly, the `resolve_expression` method in the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py` is crucial for handling query expressions, which could be closely tied to the issue's description about incorrect handling of GROUP BY when applying filters.
