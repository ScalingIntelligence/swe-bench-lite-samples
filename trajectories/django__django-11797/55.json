The initial focus should be on understanding how the `set_group_by` method in the `Query` class works and how the `get_group_by` method in the `SQLCompiler` class affects the SQL generation and interpretation. Additionally, understanding the behavior of the `annotate` method in the `QuerySet` class and the `build_filter` method in the `Query` class will provide a comprehensive context for addressing the issue. The spans identified in the `Query` class are crucial as they handle SQL generation and involve methods like `clone`, `as_sql`, and `build_filter` which could potentially affect how the GROUP BY clause is applied. The `SQLCompiler` class's span `get_group_by` is also highly relevant as it directly deals with the inclusion of fields in the GROUP BY clause. These spans provide key insights into the database query generation process in Django, which is central to resolving the reported issue.",
