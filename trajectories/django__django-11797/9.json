The problem occurs in the context of Django ORM, specifically with methods like `filter`, `annotate`, and `values`. To address this, we need to focus on the `Query`, `SQLCompiler`, `QuerySet`, `Aggregate`, and `expressions` classes and methods. Specifically, we should look into how the `build_filter`, `get_group_by`, `annotate`, `resolve_expression`, and `get_group_by_cols` methods handle the GROUP BY clause and whether they correctly preserve the intended grouping when additional filters are applied. Additionally, we should check if the `combine` method in `Query` maintains the correct GROUP BY logic when combining queries.",

The issue notes that when filtering and then applying a GROUP BY, the GROUP BY clause is not used as expected when further operations like slicing are applied. The search results provide relevant code spans within the Django ORM that deal with SQL compilation, query construction, and aggregation. Specifically, the SQLCompiler class and its methods get_group_by and collapse_group_by are likely to be relevant, as they handle the grouping of query results. Additionally, the Query class and its methods such as rewrite_cols, get_aggregation, and set_group_by are also critical as they manage query construction and annotation. Furthermore, the Aggregate class and its methods resolve_expression, get_group_by_cols, and as_sql are possibly related to the issue due to their role in handling aggregation. The QuerySet class and its methods, particularly annotate, also play a role in applying annotations to querysets, which could affect the GROUP BY behavior if not managed correctly. These identified code spans provide a comprehensive look into the parts of the Django ORM that could be contributing to or fixing the reported issue.",
