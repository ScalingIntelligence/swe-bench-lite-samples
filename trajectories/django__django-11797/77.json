The examples provided show that the GROUP BY clause is correctly applied when using '.values().annotate()' but becomes incorrect when filtering is applied in a subsequent query. From the search results, there are several relevant sections in the codebase: 1. The 'SQLCompiler.get_group_by' method which constructs the GROUP BY clause. 2. The 'Query.set_group_by' method in the Query class which sets the GROUP BY clause based on the select and annotation fields. 3. The 'QuerySet.annotate' method in the QuerySet class which adds annotations to the query and sets the GROUP BY clause if necessary. These sections of the code are likely places where the issue could be addressed, particularly focusing on how the GROUP BY clause is determined and applied relative to filter operations.",
