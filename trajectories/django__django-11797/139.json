This could be due to how Django's ORM handles the combination of filters and aggregate functions. The primary files to investigate are those related to query construction and compilation in Django's ORM: 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py', and 'django/db/models/query.py'. Specifically, the methods that handle filtering, grouping, and compiling SQL queries should be carefully reviewed.",

This is evident in the provided code snippet where the SQL query changes unexpectedly when filtering is applied to an annotated query. The issue likely lies in how Django's Query class and SQLCompiler handle the GROUP BY clause and the subsequent filtering operations.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, several relevant code spans can be identified:\n\n1. In `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, the method `Query.set_group_by` is responsible for setting the GROUP BY clause based on the annotations and selected fields. This is a critical part as it seems to be where the logic for grouping might be incorrectly applied or overridden.\n2. The `Query.rewrite_cols` method is also relevant as it involves modifying expressions and could potentially alter the GROUP BY clause if not handled correctly.\n3. The `SQLCompiler.get_group_by` method from `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` directly deals with the GROUP BY clause for SQL compilation, making it a crucial part of the process.\n4. Additionally, `SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by` could be problematic if it incorrectly reduces or changes the GROUP BY fields.\n\nThese code spans are relevant as they either directly or indirectly influence how the GROUP BY clause is applied and processed in Django's ORM. Further analysis or a closer look at how these methods interact with other parts of the query processing might reveal the exact cause of the issue reported.",

This includes adjustments to the `set_group_by` method to incorporate the initial group by columns and the implementation of the `_get_initial_group_by` method to fetch these columns. These modifications should resolve the issue where the GROUP BY clause was being overridden by subsequent filters. Therefore, the task of updating the code to handle the reported issue can be concluded as completed.",
