It processes the 'group_by' attribute of the query, ensuring that all necessary expressions are included.\n\n2. **SQLCompiler.collapse_group_by**: This method optimizes the GROUP BY clause, particularly concerning primary keys.\n\n3. **Query.set_group_by**: This method sets the GROUP BY clause based on the select expressions and annotations.\n\n4. **Query.get_aggregation**: This method handles aggregation queries, which might interact with the GROUP BY clause.\n\nThese sections are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the GROUP BY override issue mentioned in the reported issue.
