The key files to inspect are those related to query handling, SQL compilation, and aggregation in Django's ORM. Specifically, 'query.py', 'compiler.py', 'query.py', 'aggregates.py', 'subqueries.py', and 'expressions.py' are likely to contain the logic involved in processing these queries. Given the issue description, focusing on how GROUP BY is set and how filters interact with it in the 'Query' and 'SQLCompiler' classes, as well as in the 'QuerySet' methods, is crucial.",

This affects the SQL generated when using Django's ORM for certain operations involving filtering, annotating, and grouping. To address this, it's crucial to identify parts of the Django ORM codebase that handle query generation, specifically focusing on methods related to filtering, annotating, and setting GROUP BY clauses. The search results include several relevant sections from django/db/models/sql/query.py and django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, which contain methods such as `rewrite_cols`, `add_filter`, `add_q`, `set_group_by`, and `get_group_by`. These methods are directly involved in the process of constructing SQL queries, including handling how GROUP BY and filters interact. Given the nature of the issue, these sections are likely relevant. Further analysis is needed to determine if additional sections are required or if these identified spans are sufficient to address the problem fully.",
