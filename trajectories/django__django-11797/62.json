This suggests that the problem could lie in the way Django's ORM handles query combinations and the GROUP BY clause. The search results include several relevant sections of code from Django's `query.py` and `compiler.py`. These sections include methods for combining queries (`Query.combine`), resolving expressions (`Query.resolve_expression`), building filters (`Query.build_filter`), and setting the GROUP BY clause (`Query.set_group_by`). Additionally, the `SQLCompiler` class has a method for generating the GROUP BY clause (`SQLCompiler.get_group_by`). These methods are potential candidates for debugging and fixing the reported issue, as they are directly involved in the construction and optimization of SQL queries, including handling the GROUP BY clause.\n\nThe identified relevant code spans are:\n- `Query.combine`\n- `Query.resolve_expression`\n- `Query.build_filter`\n- `Query.set_group_by`\n- `SQLCompiler.get_group_by`\n\nThese spans are marked as relevant because they cover key aspects of query construction, including combination, resolution, filter building, and group by setting, which are critical for understanding and resolving the reported issue.",
