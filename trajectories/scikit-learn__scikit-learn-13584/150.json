The error 'ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous' suggests that there's a problem when handling multi-element arrays. This could be related to how the `_changed_params` function or the `__repr__` method in the `LogisticRegressionCV` class deals with array parameters like `Cs`. It's also plausible that the error arises from the `_safe_repr` function in `utils/_pprint.py`, which might not be handling array types correctly when `print_changed_only` is set to True. Therefore, I will focus my search on these specific areas.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about a ValueError when using the `print_changed_only` configuration in scikit-learn's `LogisticRegressionCV`. The error specifically occurs when using arrays, which suggests that there might be a problem with how arrays are handled in the representation logic when `print_changed_only` is enabled. I need to identify the relevant code spans responsible for this functionality and where they might involve array handling.\n\nIn the `LogisticRegressionCV` class, the main areas of interest are the `__init__`, `fit`, and perhaps other methods that handle parameters or model representations directly. This class definition includes validation and initialization of parameters, which could be the source of the error if the representation logic (triggered by `print_changed_only`) interacts with these parameters incorrectly.\n\nIn `utils/_pprint.py`, the functions `_changed_params` and `_safe_repr` are crucial as they directly handle the parameters of an estimator, including how they should be represented when `print_changed_only` is true. Specifically, `_safe_repr` function deals with the safe representation of objects, including handling their parameters, and is likely where the error arises in relation to array handling. The `_changed_params` function identifies parameters that have been changed from their default values, which is necessary for the `print_changed_only` functionality.\n\nGiven these considerations, I recommend further analysis of the `LogisticRegressionCV` class and the `_safe_repr` function in `utils/_pprint.py` to determine how arrays are being processed and represented, which should help pinpoint the source of the ValueError.",
