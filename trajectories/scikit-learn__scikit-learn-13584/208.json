The error is traced back to a `ValueError` when using arrays with more than one element. The issue directly points to the `LogisticRegressionCV` class in the `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py` file. I analyzed the search results and confirm that the `LogisticRegressionCV` class definition and the `print_changed_only` flag usage within the `_safe_repr` function in `sklearn/utils/_pprint.py` are directly relevant to the issue. The `_safe_repr` function is key as it handles the representation of objects based on the `print_changed_only` setting. The `sklearn/base.py` file also contains the `_pprint` function, which is indirectly relevant as it could impact how the representation of the `LogisticRegressionCV` object is handled. The search results include code spans with the initialization and method definitions within `LogisticRegressionCV` and the representation handling within `_safe_repr`, which together address the reported bug about vector values in the new repr.",
