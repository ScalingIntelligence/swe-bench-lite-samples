The provided search results come from the `lib/matplotlib/_constrained_layout.py` file, which is highly relevant as it directly addresses the layout engine and constrained layout functionalities in Matplotlib. After reviewing the code spans, it's evident that they cover the core functions and logic handling constrained layouts, including `do_constrained_layout`, `make_layoutgrids`, `compress_fixed_aspect`, and others. These functions are responsible for managing the layout constraints, grid settings, and repositioning axes based on the constrained layout settings. Given the comprehensive coverage of these key functions within the search results, I can confidently conclude that the identified code spans are relevant to fixing the reported issue. Therefore, they should be a good starting point for addressing the warning and ensuring that layout adjustments do not trigger unnecessary warnings when constrained layout is explicitly set to `False`.",

This was not the case in previous versions.\r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport numpy as np\r\na = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)\r\nb = np.sin(a)\r\nc = np.cos(a)\r\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,2),constrained_layout=False)\r\nax[0].plot(a,b)\r\nax[1].plot(a,c)\r\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\nThe plot works fine but the warning is generated\r\n\r\n`/var/folders/ss/pfgdfm2x7_s4cyw2v0b_t7q80000gn/T/ipykernel_76923/4170965423.py:7: UserWarning: This figure was using a layout engine that is incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; not calling subplots_adjust.\r\n  plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)`\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nno warning\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nWarning disappears when constrained_layout=False is removed\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nOS/X\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.6.0\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
