These sections contain the code responsible for initializing the figure with specific layout parameters and for setting the layout engine, which directly relates to the handling of constrained_layout.

Based on the code, when both 'tight_layout' and 'constrained_layout' are set together, it warns about their incompatibility. However, the issue described occurs even when 'constrained_layout' is explicitly set to False. Therefore, the next step is to delve deeper into how the layout engines, especially 'constrained' and 'tight', interact and how the warning is generated when their settings are incompatible, even when 'constrained_layout' is purportedly turned off.

            "scratch_pad": "The initial examination of the file context and the issue description suggests that the warning is triggered due to a conflict or misconfiguration between the various layout engine settings in the Matplotlib library, specifically when `plt.subplots_adjust` or `bbox_inches='tight'` are used with `constrained_layout=False`. The provided file excerpt from `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` shows the `Figure` class, where the initialization and layout engine configuration take place. This includes the handling of 'layout', 'tight_layout', and 'constrained_layout' parameters, as well as the `set_layout_engine` and `set_constrained_layout` methods. Based on the code, when both 'tight_layout' and 'constrained_layout' are set together, it warns about their incompatibility. However, the issue described occurs even when 'constrained_layout' is explicitly set to False. Therefore, the next step is to delve deeper into how the layout engines, especially 'constrained' and 'tight', interact and how the warning is generated when their settings are incompatible, even when 'constrained_layout' is purportedly turned off. This involves a focus on the `_api.warn_external` calls and how the various layout engine types and methods are implemented and interact with each other.",

This was not the case in previous versions.\r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport numpy as np\r\na = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)\r\nb = np.sin(a)\r\nc = np.cos(a)\r\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,2),constrained_layout=False)\r\nax[0].plot(a,b)\r\nax[1].plot(a,c)\r\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\nThe plot works fine but the warning is generated\r\n\r\n`/var/folders/ss/pfgdfm2x7_s4cyw2v0b_t7q80000gn/T/ipykernel_76923/4170965423.py:7: UserWarning: This figure was using a layout engine that is incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; not calling subplots_adjust.\r\n  plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)`\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nno warning\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nWarning disappears when constrained_layout=False is removed\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nOS/X\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.6.0\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
