This was not the case in previous versions.\r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport numpy as np\r\na = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)\r\nb = np.sin(a)\r\nc = np.cos(a)\r\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,2),constrained_layout=False)\r\nax[0].plot(a,b)\r\nax[1].plot(a,c)\r\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\nThe plot works fine but the warning is generated\r\n\r\n`/var/folders/ss/pfgdfm2x7_s4cyw2v0b_t7q80000gn/T/ipykernel_76923/4170965423.py:7: UserWarning: This figure was using a layout engine that is incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; not calling subplots_adjust.\r\n  plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)`\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nno warning\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nWarning disappears when constrained_layout=False is removed\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nOS/X\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.6.0\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
