This warning indicates that a layout engine is being used that is incompatible with these adjustments, despite the constrained layout being explicitly set to False. The search results provided include the relevant sections of the `Figure` class in matplotlib, particularly focusing on the initialization method and the methods related to setting the layout engines (`set_tight_layout` and `set_constrained_layout`). The analysis of the code reveals that the warning arises from the logic in the initialization method where both `tight_layout` and `constrained_layout` are checked against each other and warned if they are used together. Additionally, the initialization method ensures that if `tight_layout` or `constrained_layout` is not None, the appropriate layout engine is set. This indicates that the code might be setting a layout engine despite the explicit `False` setting, leading to the incompatibility warning. Therefore, the relevant sections to address this issue would be the initialization method, and the deprecated methods `set_tight_layout` and `set_constrained_layout` which handle the layout settings that are causing the warning. These sections should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that the settings align with user expectations and do not lead to warnings when `constrained_layout=False` is explicitly set.",

This bug involves interaction between different layout engines and how they should behave when one is explicitly disabled. \n\nIn the provided `file_context`, we saw the `Figure` class where initialization and setting of different layout engines are handled. The initial analysis highlighted code related to setting `tight_layout` and `constrained_layout`, pointing to deprecated methods and the new `set_layout_engine` method which manages the transition and warning handling for incompatible configurations.\n\nMoving to the `search_results`, we found the `TightLayoutEngine` and `ConstrainedLayoutEngine` classes. These manage the behavior and execution of layout adjustments. The `TightLayoutEngine` is designed to be compatible with `plt.subplots_adjust`, while `ConstrainedLayoutEngine` is explicitly marked as not compatible, which seems contradictory to the issue's expectation that `constrained_layout=False` should avoid warnings.\n\nThe key spans to identify are those defining the execution and setup of these layout engines, particularly how they interact with the figure's layout configurations. These spans are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms and potential points of conflict that could be causing the warning in the reported issue.\n\nThe identified spans from `figure.py` are related to the initialization and setup of the Figure object, including how it handles `constrained_layout` and `tight_layout`, which is directly connected to the issue being investigated. In the `layout_engine.py` file, the identified spans are particularly relevant as they describe the execution behavior of each layout engine, addressing how they potentially handle or interfere with subplots adjustments, thus likely being at the core of the observed bug interaction leading to the warning.",
