The problem likely lies in how the subscripts are being generated or formatted within these methods. The `_print_MatrixElement` method uses a straightforward string formatting approach which could inadvertently lead to double subscript errors if not handled correctly.

The analysis needs to identify the relevant code spans that handle the LaTeX printing of matrix operations like MatMul and possibly MatrixElement. From the provided context and search results, the relevant spans include '_print_MatMul' in LatexPrinter class and possibly '_print_MatrixElement', though the latter is more about individual elements than matrix multiplication.\n\nConsidering the search results, the identified '_print_MatMul' method is crucial as it directly handles the LaTeX printing of matrix multiplications, which is at the core of the reported issue. The method processes the matrix multiplication expression and generates LaTeX output. Thus, this span is directly relevant to resolve the double subscript error in the LaTeX output for matrix multiplication. Additionally, the method of processing the matrix multiplication expression is thoroughly examined to ensure all logical branches are considered for potential errors or unusual output scenarios.",
