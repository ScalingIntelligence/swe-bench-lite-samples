The method does not explicitly handle subscripts, which might indicate that the issue is occurring deeper in the matrix operations or in the sum generation inside `_entry`.\n\n3. **_entry**: This method computes an individual entry of the resulting matrix from a matrix multiplication. It uses `Sum` and generates indices dynamically using `Dummy`, which might lead to the formation of unintended double subscripts when forming the LaTeX string. This method's handling of indices and their summation in the LaTeX context is of particular interest.\n\nGiven the above observations, the focus should remain on how indices are handled and transformed into LaTeX strings in both `_print_MatrixElement` and `_entry`.

Specifically, _print_MatrixElement constructs LaTeX strings for individual matrix elements with subscripts, _print_MatMul generates LaTeX for matrix multiplications, and _entry computes individual entries for matrix multiplication, likely where the double subscript issue arises. Given these methods are present and directly related to the functionality described in the issue, the relevant parts of the file context for addressing the issue seem to be provided.",
