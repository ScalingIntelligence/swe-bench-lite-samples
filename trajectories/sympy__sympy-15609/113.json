The relevant code spans should focus on the `LatexPrinter` class and its methods responsible for printing matrix elements and matrix multiplication in LaTeX format. The `LatexPrinter._print_MatrixElement` and `LatexPrinter._print_MatMul` methods are critically examined since they deal directly with generating the latex string for matrix elements and multiplication. The `MatMul._entry` method in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py` is also relevant as it calculates the matrix entry for multiplication, which is then used in the LaTeX generation. Additionally, understanding the context in which these methods are used and how they interact with other parts of the code is crucial. By analyzing these methods, it's clear that the `_print_MatrixElement` method directly formats the subscript indices for matrix elements, and any error in handling these indices could lead to the double subscript issue. The `_print_MatMul` method, while not directly appearing problematic, interacts with the matrix element formatting and therefore needs to be considered to ensure a complete resolution of the issue.",

Analyzing the provided code spans, I observe that the `_print_MatrixElement` method in the `LatexPrinter` class is responsible for formatting matrix elements into LaTeX. This method directly constructs LaTeX strings for matrix elements using the format string `'_{%s, %s}'`, where each `%s` is replaced by the respective indices `i` and `j`. It is possible that similar handling in other parts of the code, such as the `_print_MatMul` method, might also contribute to the issue. Reviewing the `_print_MatMul` method, I see that it handles the printing of matrix multiplications, potentially involved in forming the LaTeX expression that leads to the double subscript. Based on the issue description and the existing methods in the `LatexPrinter` class, it seems the problem lies in how the indices for matrix elements are being handled during LaTeX string construction. Therefore, focusing on the methods `_print_MatrixElement` and `_print_MatMul` should help in identifying and potentially fixing the issue.",

The `_print_MatMul` method directly joins the printed representations of the matrix multiplication arguments without addressing the indices, which is likely causing the LaTeX rendering issue. The `MatMul` class provides the underlying functionality for matrix multiplication but does not directly address the LaTeX printing issue. Based on the provided context, the relevant parts for addressing the LaTeX rendering issue are identified, but the specific solution to fix the double subscript issue is not yet implemented in the provided code. The `_print_MatMul` method likely needs to be updated to handle subscripts similar to how `_print_MatrixElement` does.",
