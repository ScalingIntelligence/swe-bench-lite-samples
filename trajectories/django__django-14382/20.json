The relevant code spans in the search results include the directory imports and the definition of the `TemplateCommand` class, particularly the `validate_name` method. This method is where the current error originates as it uses `os.path.basename` on a path without stripping trailing slashes. The solution involves modifying this part of the code to strip any trailing slashes before processing. The current context indicates no previously identified relevant code, so all information is based on the provided search results. Stepping through the code, it's clear that the `validate_name` method will raise the reported error if a path with trailing slashes is passed. Therefore, the identified solution to modify this method by stripping trailing slashes should fix the issue. The `validate_name` method is the primary focus as it directly deals with validating and processing the directory name, making it the most relevant code span to address the reported problem.",
