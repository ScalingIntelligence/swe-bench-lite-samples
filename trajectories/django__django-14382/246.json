The issue specifically refers to the handling of trailing slashes in directory names, which is explicitly mentioned in the error description and suggested fix. The provided search results contain the entire `TemplateCommand` class, which includes the `validate_name` method at line 77 as mentioned in the issue.\n\nReviewing the `validate_name` method in the context of the issue, it is clear that the method calls `os.path.basename(target)` without stripping potential trailing slashes (`os.sep`), leading to the error. The fix proposed in the issue suggests modifying this line to `os.path.basename(target.rstrip(os.sep))`. This should resolve the described problem.\n\nGiven that the problem and the proposed solution directly reference the `validate_name` method within the `TemplateCommand` class, I can confidently conclude that the relevant code to address the issue is found within the `django/core/management/templates.py` file, specifically within the `TemplateCommand.validate_name` span.",
