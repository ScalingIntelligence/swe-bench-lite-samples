The issue states that when using union() on filtered QuerySets and then calling none(), it results in all objects from the QuerySet being added, whereas using the OR query approach does not. This discrepancy is critical to investigate. In the search results, several relevant sections of code were found. The 'Query.combine' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' handles the combination of queries, which is likely where the union operation is processed. The 'QuerySet.union' and 'QuerySet.none' methods in 'django/db/models/query.py' are directly related to the union operation and the none() method respectively, which are central to the reported issue. These methods will be crucial in identifying the root cause and potential fixes for the behavior described. Additionally, 'Query.build_filter' and 'Query.set_empty' methods might be relevant as they handle filter construction and setting a query to be empty, both of which are likely involved when dealing with the none() method on a QuerySet. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue and should be further reviewed and tested to verify and resolve the issue.",

With this code (excuse the bizarre example filtering):\nclass Publication(models.Model):\n\tpass\nclass Article(models.Model):\n\tpublications = models.ManyToManyField(to=Publication, blank=True, null=True)\nclass ArticleForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tpublications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(\n\t\tPublication.objects.filter(id__lt=2) | Publication.objects.filter(id__gt=5),\n\t\trequired=False,\n\t)\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tmodel = Article\n\t\tfields = [\"publications\"]\nclass ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tform = ArticleForm\nThis works well. However, changing the ModelMultipleChoiceField queryset to use union() breaks things.\npublications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(\n\tPublication.objects.filter(id__lt=2).union(\n\t\tPublication.objects.filter(id__gt=5)\n\t),\n\trequired=False,\n)\nThe form correctly shows only the matching objects. However, if you submit this form while empty (i.e. you didn't select any publications), ALL objects matching the queryset will be added. Using the OR query, NO objects are added, as I'd expect.\n"
