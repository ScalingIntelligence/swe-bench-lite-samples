Specifically, when using union(), an empty form submission unexpectedly adds all objects matching the queryset, whereas using OR queries does not.

Specifically, `QuerySet.none()`, `QuerySet._combinator_query()`, `QuerySet.union()`, and the SQL compilation and execution methods in `SQLCompiler` are critical.\n\nGiven the analysis, the relevant code spans have been identified, and it is sufficient to consider the search task complete.",

Specifically, it seems that using `union()` in a `ModelMultipleChoiceField` queryset causes all objects to be added when the form is submitted empty, which is not the expected behavior.\n\nFrom the code excerpts provided, several key methods are relevant to this issue: `combine()`, `promote_joins()`, `build_filter()`, `add_filter()`, `add_q()`, `_add_q()`, and `split_exclude()`. These methods handle the combination of queries, the promotion of joins, and the filtering logic. The issue might be related to how `union()` results are handled in these methods, particularly in terms of negating the results or ensuring that combined queries respect the `none()` call if used.\n\nGiven the provided code spans, it appears that the focus should be on the `Query` class methods that deal with combination and filtering, such as those involved in handling `union()` and reconciling the results with the form submission logic in Django's ORM. Specifically, the `combine()` method handles combining two queries and might not properly prevent the addition of all objects if one of the queries results in `none()`. Also, `build_filter()`, `add_filter()`, and `_add_q()` are crucial for understanding how filters are added to the query, and could potentially explain the behavior observed when using `union()`. Finally, `split_exclude()` could be relevant if the negation of certain objects during query combination is not handled appropriately.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the identified spans focus on the methods in Django's ORM that are likely responsible for the `union()` behavior causing all objects to be added, which is not the expected behavior when a `none()` call is supposed to limit results. These spans will help in understanding how these methods interact and implement the behavior that leads to this issue.",

This method interacts with `JoinPromoter` class, which handles the logical assembly of queries. The method `promote_joins()` is also described, which is essential for handling nullable joins and join type promotions. Additionally, methods like `build_filter()`, `add_filter()`, `add_q()`, `_add_q()`, and `split_exclude()` are included, which handle various aspects of query construction, including filtering and exclusion clauses. These methods are central to understanding how `QuerySet` operations are translated to SQL and how they might interact with methods like `none()` and `union()`. Given the comprehensive nature of these methods and their relation to query combination and SQL generation, it is plausible that these methods could be involved in the issue of `QuerySet.none()` not behaving as expected with `union()`. However, while the provided context gives a deep insight into query combination and SQL generation, the direct interaction between `none()` and `union()` specifically within these methods is not explicitly detailed. Further investigation into how `none()` is processed within these methods could provide clearer insight into the issue.",
            "search_suggestions": "Look into how the `none()` method interacts with the `union()` method within the `combine()` and `promote_joins()` methods. Additionally, investigate if there are specific conditions or data types that might influence how `none()` interacts with `union()` in the context of SQL generation."
