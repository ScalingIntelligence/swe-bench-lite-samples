The relevance of the provided code spans lies in understanding how the `QuerySet` class manages queries, especially the `none()` and `union()` methods. These methods are central to the user's issue. The `QuerySet.none()` method is supposed to return an empty queryset, which is not behaving as expected when combined with the `union()` method, based on the user's description. The `union()` method itself is also critical, as it is explicitly mentioned as the cause of the issue. Additionally, the `Query.combine()` method, which is responsible for combining two queries, might be relevant to understand how the combination of queries affects the results. This thorough analysis suggests that the provided spans are relevant to the user's issue as they directly involve the methods in question and their operations.",

From the search results, the relevant spans include `QuerySet._combinator_query`, `Query.combine`, and `Query.set_empty`.

The `Query` class also contains methods like `combine()`, which likely play a role in how query sets are combined, and `set_empty()` in `Query`, which is likely to be relevant in defining an empty query state. Therefore, the provided file context does seem to contain the code that could be responsible for the observed behavior or where a fix might need to be implemented.
