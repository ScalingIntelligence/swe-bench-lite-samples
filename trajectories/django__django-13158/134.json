The user observed that using `union()` in a `ModelMultipleChoiceField` results in all objects being added if the form is submitted while empty, while the OR query behaves as expected. This discrepancy in behavior points to potential issues in how Django handles combined queries, particularly when subsetting the results to an empty set. The relevant sections of code from the search results involve the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which handles query construction, combination, and the setting of empty queries. Additionally, the `ModelMultipleChoiceField` class in `django/forms/models.py` is relevant as it manages the form field logic, including the validation and processing of queryset inputs. These sections of code are likely involved in the observed behavior. However, more context or direct interaction with these parts of the code may be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.",
