            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves an unexpected behavior when using the `QuerySet.none()` method in combination with `union()` in Django's forms. The problem manifests when submitting the form without selecting any publications, resulting in all matching objects being added instead of none. The core issue seems to be related to how the `union()` method interacts with `QuerySet.none()` in the context of form handling. To address this, the search should focus on relevant parts of the Django codebase that handle QuerySet operations, specifically those related to the `union()` method and `QuerySet.none()` in the context of forms and model field operations. Additionally, it's important to look into the handling of `ModelMultipleChoiceField` and the form submission process to understand how the queryset operations might affect form behavior.",

Process New Search Results: 3.1 Analyze each code span: - QuerySet.__init__, QuerySet.none, QuerySet.all, QuerySet.filter, QuerySet.exclude, QuerySet._filter_or_exclude, QuerySet._filter_or_exclude_inplace: These methods are directly related to the QuerySet logic and the reported issue. - ModelMultipleChoiceField.__init__, ModelMultipleChoiceField.to_python, ModelMultipleChoiceField.clean, ModelMultipleChoiceField._check_values, ModelMultipleChoiceField.prepare_value, ModelMultipleChoiceField.has_changed: These methods are related to the forms handling, specifically the ModelMultipleChoiceField which is mentioned in the issue. - ModelAdmin.formfield_for_manytomany: This method is relevant as it deals with form fields for many-to-many relationships, which is related to the issue. 3.2 Match with key elements in the issue: The issue involves the behavior of QuerySet.none() with combined queries, particularly when using the union() method. This relates directly to the QuerySet methods found in the search results. 3.3 Evaluate relevance: - QuerySet methods (none, filter, exclude, etc.) are highly relevant as they deal directly with the query behavior. - ModelMultipleChoiceField methods are relevant as they involve the form handling and how querysets are processed in the form. 3.4 Identify relevant code spans: Based on the analysis, the spans QuerySet.none and ModelMultipleChoiceField.clean are directly relevant to the issue. 4.

However, changing the ModelMultipleChoiceField queryset to use union() breaks things.\npublications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(\n\tPublication.objects.filter(id__lt=2).union(\n\t\tPublication.objects.filter(id__gt=5)\n\t),\n\trequired=False,\n)\nThe form correctly shows only the matching objects. However, if you submit this form while empty (i.e. you didn't select any publications), ALL objects matching the queryset will be added. Using the OR query, NO objects are added, as I'd expect.\n"
