The issue specifically mentions that the current implementation expects QDP commands to be in upper case, which is not compliant with the actual QDP standard that supports case-insensitive commands. The user-reported issue indicates that the parser should be able to handle commands in any case, allowing for a more flexible input handling. By reviewing the code, we need to find the sections that parse and recognize QDP commands and ensure they are not exclusively upper case. The main focus should be on `_read_table_qdp` and `_write_table_qdp` functions as they are central to reading and writing QDP files, respectively. Additionally, the `QDP` class and its associated methods `read` and `write` will be relevant as they interface with these functions, potentially passing case-sensitive commands or information on command processing sensitivity.",
