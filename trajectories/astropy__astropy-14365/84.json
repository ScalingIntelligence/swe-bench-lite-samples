The relevant parts of the codebase to address this issue are the methods and classes handling the reading of QDP files, particularly those that parse and interpret commands. From the provided search results, the 'QDP' class and its methods, such as the 'read' method, are responsible for reading QDP files into a table format. Additionally, the '_read_table_qdp' function, which is called by the 'QDP.read' method, is directly involved in the reading and interpreting of QDP file content. These are the sections of the code that need to be adjusted to handle case-insensitive QDP commands. Given the issue, these sections appear relevant and sufficient to address the problem, as they involve the actual reading and interpretation of the commands. However, further analysis of the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function, which is not included in the provided results, might be necessary to ensure complete case-insensitivity handling.",
