The current implementation explicitly expects uppercase commands like 'READ SERR 1 2', which is not aligned with the case insensitivity of the QDP format. The relevant sections of the code to address this issue are the ones responsible for interpreting error lines and reading the QDP file. Specifically, the functions `_interpret_err_lines` and `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` need to be adjusted to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. These functions parse the commands and interpret the error specifications, and modifying them to lowercase the command inputs before processing would resolve the case sensitivity issue. Additionally, the `QDPSplitter`, `QDPHeader`, and `QDPData` classes, which are used for parsing the QDP format, should be reviewed to ensure consistency with the proposed changes. The aim is to allow commands like 'read serr 1 2' to be processed correctly without throwing errors. Identifying and modifying these parts of the code should enable the system to correctly interpret and process QDP files with mixed or lowercase commands.",

To address this, the relevant code spans should target the handling of QDP command lines within the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function and the '_interpret_err_lines' function, as these are responsible for interpreting and processing QDP commands. The new search results contain these functions, particularly '_get_type_from_list_of_lines' which determines the type of each line and '_get_lines_from_file' which retrieves lines from the file.
