The current implementation hardcodes the commands in uppercase (e.g., 'READ SERR'), which fails when encountering lowercase commands in user-generated QDP files. To resolve this, the code responsible for parsing QDP commands should be modified to be case-insensitive. Based on the search results, two primary spans of code seem relevant: 1. '_write_table_qdp': This function handles writing QDP files and explicitly uses uppercase commands. This needs to change to allow case-insensitive commands. 2. 'QDP.read': This method is responsible for reading QDP files and calls '_read_table_qdp'. The handling of command lines within this reading process needs to be made case-insensitive. Given this, the identified spans directly address the issue of case sensitivity in QDP command handling, suggesting that they are both relevant and necessary to effectively resolve the reported problem.",

Specifically, the code should handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. The provided context and search results confirm that '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and '_interpret_err_lines' functions are central to this, as they process the commands and interpret error specifications. Additionally, the '_read_table_qdp' function, which reads the table using the QDP format, should also handle the case insensitivity, especially when parsing the command lines within the '_interpret_err_lines' function. To address this, edits should be made to ensure that all command lines are converted to a consistent case (e.g., lowercasing the whole command line) to ensure that subsequent processing is case-insensitive.
