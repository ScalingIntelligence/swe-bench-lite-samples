The issue states that ascii.qdp expects commands to be uppercase, but QDP itself is not case-sensitive. When examining the search results, I see that the code in 'astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py' contains the logic for reading QDP files and parsing commands ('qdp_file'). Specifically, I noticed that the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function processes lines from a QDP file and identifies commands. Within this function, commands are being processed in a strict manner, which could cause the problem mentioned in the issue since it seems to expect all commands to be in uppercase. Furthermore, the '_read_table_qdp' function could also be relevant as it calls '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and could be the point of interaction with the user code. Looking at the 'QDP' class, it also involves reading tables, which might initially process the QDP commands or data. These parts of the code need to be inspected or possibly modified to handle case-insensitive commands to resolve the issue.",
