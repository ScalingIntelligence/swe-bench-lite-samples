To resolve this issue, we need to identify the code sections responsible for parsing and interpreting QDP commands. The relevant code spans include '_get_lines_from_file', '_interpret_err_lines', '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', and '_read_table_qdp'. '_get_lines_from_file' reads the file and splits it into lines, '_interpret_err_lines' interprets the error specifications by parsing commands like 'READ SERR'. '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' processes the QDP file line by line to extract tables and commands, and '_read_table_qdp' reads the QDP file into a table, handling commands and data rows. These functions will need to be modified to handle case-insensitive commands as per the QDP standard.
