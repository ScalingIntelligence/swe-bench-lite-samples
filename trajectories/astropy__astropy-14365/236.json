It currently processes commands on the premise that they are all-caps, which leads to issues when lower case commands are encountered. The function '_interpret_err_lines' interprets these error specifications from command lines. This function assumes the commands are in a specific case format which is not ideal. The function should be modified to be case-insensitive when processing these command lines to fix the issue. The relevant spans to modify are '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and '_interpret_err_lines'.
