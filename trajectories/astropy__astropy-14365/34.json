These spans are relevant because they directly handle the reading and interpretation of QDP files, which is where the case sensitivity issue lies.

The task is to identify code spans that handle QDP command parsing and potentially those that raise errors for unrecognized commands. This will allow for modifications to make the command parsing case-insensitive. From the provided code, '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and '_read_table_qdp' are critical functions since they deal with reading QDP files and parsing commands. Specifically, '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' processes lines from the QDP file, identifies commands, and determines the number of columns based on command specifications. This involves handling commands with the lower() function, suggesting that adjustment can be made here to support case-insensitivity. Additionally, the '_interpret_err_lines' function interprets error specifications from command lines, which is directly linked to the processing of 'read serr' commands and should be included in possible modifications to ensure case-insensitivity supports the expected behavior. The 'QDP' class and its methods, especially 'read', also involve reading QDP files and could require adjustments if the logic for interpreting commands or error handling is centralized there. These sections should be reviewed and potentially modified to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner without overlooking other functionalities they handle.",
