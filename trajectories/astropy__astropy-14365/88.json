            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the case sensitivity of QDP commands in the `ascii.qdp` format of the Astropy library. Specifically, it points out that the current implementation only recognizes uppercase commands, whereas QDP files themselves are not case sensitive. This discrepancy causes errors when reading QDP files that use lowercase commands.\n\nThe search results contain several key spans that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. The `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function processes QDP files, identifying command lines, comments, and data. It currently processes command lines in a case-sensitive manner, which directly relates to the issue.\n\n2. The `_read_table_qdp` function is responsible for reading a QDP file and returning a table. It calls `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, so changes here would inherently affect how QDP files are read.\n\n3. The `QDP.read` method within the `QDP` class is part of the reading process. Although it does not directly process the command lines, it is part of the broader reading mechanism and should be considered when addressing case sensitivity.\n\nTo resolve the issue, modifications should be made to handle command lines in a case-insensitive manner within the `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function. This can be achieved by converting command lines to a common case (either upper or lower) before processing them. This change would ensure that QDP files with both uppercase and lowercase commands can be correctly interpreted and read into a `Table`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue can be identified.",
