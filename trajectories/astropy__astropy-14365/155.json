The relevant code spans are those that deal with interpreting error lines and getting tables from the QDP file. Specifically, `_interpret_err_lines` is responsible for interpreting the error specifications from the commands, and `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` processes the entire QDP file, including handling commands. The reported issue points to the necessity of making the command parsing case-insensitive, which primarily involves modifying the handling of commands in `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`. The identified spans involve the core functions needed to address the issue by ensuring that commands are processed without case sensitivity.",
