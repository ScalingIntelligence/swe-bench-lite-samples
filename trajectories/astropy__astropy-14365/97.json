Given the search results, the relevant code spans seem to be in the handling of QDP commands within the functions _get_tables_from_qdp_file and _read_table_qdp. Specifically, the function _get_tables_from_qdp_file parses the QDP file line by line, identifying 'command' lines and processing them. The issue likely arises in this function's treatment of command lines. To address the issue, the function should be modified to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner.

To address the reported issue, modifications would need to be made to handle case insensitivity in these command parsing sections.
