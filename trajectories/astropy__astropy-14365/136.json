This is evident in the function _write_table_qdp, where commands like 'READ SERR' and 'READ TERR' are hardcoded in uppercase. To resolve this, the relevant code spans must handle QDP commands without being case-sensitive. Notably, the _read_table_qdp function is also implicated as it currently reads QDP files assuming uppercase commands. Both functions need to be adjusted to accommodate mixed or lowercase commands to meet the expected behavior described in the issue. Additionally, the error handling in _read_table_qdp, which raises a ValueError for 'Unrecognized QDP line', should be examined to ensure it does not prematurely halt processing for non-uppercase commands.",

Specifically, the line where commands are parsed and the subsequent logic that interprets these commands should ensure that the commands are not case-sensitive.

Further, the span '_interpret_err_lines' which is involved in interpreting error columns definitions might be relevant but only in a support role to `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`'s command interpretation, thus prioritizing updates in the largest and most comprehensive function that handles the main QDP logic.

The current implementation assumes commands are in upper case, which leads to a crash when encountering commands in lower case. The main focus is on the `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function, which processes QDP file commands and data. In this function, commands are currently processed by splitting lines and checking for specific upper case commands. To resolve the issue, the command handling should be modified to be case-insensitive. The relevant sections are the parsing of command lines and the handling of error specifications (serr, terr). The provided search results include the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', '_interpret_err_lines', and '_read_table_qdp' functions, which are directly related to the processing of QDP files and handling of commands. These functions must be adjusted to ignore case when processing commands. Additionally, the '_interpret_err_lines' function is responsible for interpreting error commands and should be modified to accept commands in any case. The '_read_table_qdp' function, which calls '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', will also need to be reviewed to ensure consistent handling. These changes will allow the reader to correctly interpret QDP files regardless of the case of the commands.",
