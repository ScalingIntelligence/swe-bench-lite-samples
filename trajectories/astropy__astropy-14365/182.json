By analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the function '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' in 'astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py' processes the QDP file lines, including commands, and currently expects commands to be in upper case. To resolve the issue, this function needs to be modified to recognize commands regardless of their case. Specifically, the part of the function where commands are processed should be updated to handle mixed case commands. Additionally, the '_read_table_qdp' function calls '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and is involved in reading the QDP file, making it relevant to the issue.
