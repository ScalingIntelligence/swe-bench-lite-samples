The span `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` contains the logic for parsing commands and data lines from the QDP file, and it should be updated to handle case-insensitive commands.

The current implementation assumes that commands are uppercase, but QDP itself is not case sensitive. To address this, the relevant code spans need to be identified and potentially modified to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. Upon analyzing the provided search results, particularly the `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function, it becomes evident that the commands are being processed as case-sensitive. However, in the `_interpret_err_lines` function, the commands are processed in a case-insensitive manner while interpreting error lines. This indicates that the key part of the function, which should be modified or reviewed for case insensitivity feature addition, resides within the processing of command lines shown both in code spans of `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and `_interpret_err_lines`. Furthermore, to ensure complete and correct implementation of handling QDP commands regardless of their cases, the `_interpret_err_lines` function performs a deep copy to avoid altering the original dictionary, thereby proving to be a revised area to re-implement a case-insensitive command feature. The identified spans of code are therefore relevant to the issue and will help in addressing the case sensitivity problem by providing foundational code sections that need to be transformed or enhanced into a case-insensitive variant. Additionally, `_read_table_qdp` function presents an overarching look into how QDP tables are read and processed in the system, further cementing its key role and relevance within the scope of this reported issue.",
