The current implementation assumes all commands are upper case, which is not always the case in manual QDP files. I've identified a few key areas in the code that handle QDP file reading and parsing, specifically the functions `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, `_read_table_qdp`, and the `QDP` class. These areas are responsible for interpreting command lines and handling data rows. They would need to be modified to accept commands in any case (not just uppercase) to resolve the issue. The `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function processes commands and interprets error specifications, likely where the case sensitivity issue arises. The `_read_table_qdp` function handles reading the table from the QDP file and could potentially be a good entry point for handling case-insensitive commands. The `QDP` class appears to be the main interface for reading QDP files, so it might need adjustments to support this behavior.",
