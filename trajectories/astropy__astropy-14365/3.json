The relevant code spans are identified in the `astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py` file. The `_write_table_qdp` function specifically is where the commands are written in uppercase (e.g., 'READ SERR'). This is where the case-insensitivity should be addressed to allow both uppercase and lowercase commands when writing the table. Additionally, the `_read_table_qdp` function should be reviewed to ensure that it can handle both uppercase and lowercase commands when reading the table. It appears that the `QDP` class and its methods are central to the implementation of reading and writing QDP files, thus making them also relevant. The identified spans include the reading and writing functions as well as the QDP class itself, which is involved in both processes.",
