The functions '_read_table_qdp' and 'read' in the QDP class are prime candidates for investigation as they are responsible for reading QDP files into tables. Additionally, considering that the error message indicates an 'Unrecognized QDP line', potential locations to address this issue include functions like '_get_type_from_list_of_lines' and '_interpret_err_lines'.
