The task is to identify code spans that handle the reading and writing of QDP files and determine if they are enforcing uppercase commands. By examining the provided search results, I've identified several key code spans that are relevant to this issue. These spans include functions for reading (`_read_table_qdp`) and writing (`_write_table_qdp`) QDP files, as well as class definitions for `QDPHeader`, `QDPData`, and `QDP`. The `_write_table_qdp` function directly prints QDP commands in uppercase (e.g., 'READ SERR' and 'READ TERR'). Furthermore, the `QDP.read` function likely needs to be adjusted to handle case-insensitive commands. These spans appear to be directly related to the issue of case sensitivity in QDP commands, making them relevant to the reported issue.",
