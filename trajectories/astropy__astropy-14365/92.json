This assumption causes problems when reading QDP files that use lower or mixed case commands. By analyzing the provided code spans, we can identify the portions of the code responsible for reading and interpreting QDP commands. The function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` is particularly relevant as it processes QDP file lines to extract commands and data. It is here that the case sensitivity issue likely occurs, as the code appears to directly use command strings without any case normalization. This function and its associated methods warrant deeper investigation for potential modifications to address the case sensitivity issue. Additionally, the method `_read_table_qdp` which calls `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and the initialization method `QDP.__init__` are also relevant as they set up the environment for reading QDP files. These sections of code need to be updated to handle case insensitive commands.",
