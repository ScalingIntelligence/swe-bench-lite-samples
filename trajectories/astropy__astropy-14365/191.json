Specifically, the QDP file parser expects commands to be in upper case, which is not consistent with the case insensitivity of the QDP format itself. This leads to errors when parsing QDP files that contain commands in lower case. The expected behavior is that a QDP file with lower case commands should be read into a Table without crashing.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified in the provided context and search results include functions and methods responsible for reading and interpreting QDP files, particularly those related to handling commands and errors. These are:\n\n1. '_get_lines_from_file' - This function reads the lines from a QDP file, which is a crucial starting point for parsing.\n2. '_interpret_err_lines' - This function interprets the error specifications in the QDP file, specifically handling 'serr' and 'terr' commands.\n3. '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' - This function processes the entire QDP file to extract tables, including handling of commands and data lines. It uses '_interpret_err_lines' to determine column names based on error specifications.\n4. '_read_table_qdp' - This function reads a specific table from the QDP file, utilizing the output of '_get_tables_from_qdp_file'.\n5. 'QDP.read' - This method initiates the reading process by calling '_read_table_qdp'.\n\nAll these code spans are relevant as they collectively handle the reading and interpretation of QDP files. Modifying these to ensure case insensitivity should resolve the issue. However, 'QDP.__init__' and the 'QDP' class itself are not directly involved in parsing commands and thus are less relevant for the reported issue.",
