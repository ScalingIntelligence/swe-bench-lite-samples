            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the ASCII QDP format in the astropy library, specifically that the qdp reader expects commands to be in upper case, while the QDP format itself is case-insensitive. The search results provide a comprehensive overview of the qdp reading and writing functionalities in the astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py module. The _read_table_qdp function is crucial as it directly handles the reading of QDP files into a Table object. The _write_table_qdp function, on the other hand, handles the writing of Table objects back into the QDP format, including the formatting of error columns. The QDP class encapsulates the reading and writing processes, utilizing the previously mentioned functions. Given the issue's focus on case sensitivity in reading QDP files, the _get_tables_from_qdp_file function (though not directly provided in the search results) is likely to be involved in parsing the QDP file and should be reviewed for potential modifications to handle case-insensitive commands. The identified spans include the _read_table_qdp and _write_table_qdp functions, as well as the QDP class and its read and write methods, which are all directly related to the handling of QDP files. The QDPHeader and QDPData classes, which are part of the QDP class, might also need to be adjusted to accommodate case-insensitive handling. The relevance of these spans is confirmed by their direct involvement in the tasks of reading from and writing to the QDP format, which the issue targets for improvement.",

  "initial_message": "ascii.qdp Table format assumes QDP commands are upper case\n### Description\n\nascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case, for example, for errors they must be \"READ SERR 1 2\" whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive and case use \"read serr 1 2\". \r\n\r\nAs many QDP files are created by hand, the expectation that all commands be all-caps should be removed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe following qdp file should read into a `Table` with errors, rather than crashing.\r\n```\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nCreate a QDP file:\r\n```\r\n> cat > test.qdp\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n<EOF>\r\n\r\n > python\r\nPython 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from astropy.table import Table\r\n>>> Table.read('test.qdp',format='ascii.qdp')\r\nWARNING: table_id not specified.
