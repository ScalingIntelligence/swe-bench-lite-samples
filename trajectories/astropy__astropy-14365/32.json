The current implementation in astropy.io.ascii.qdp.py assumes that all commands are upper case, which does not align with the actual behavior of QDP, which is case-insensitive. To address this, I need to focus on the parts of the code responsible for interpreting and processing QDP commands, particularly those related to error specifications (like 'serr' and 'terr'). The function `_interpret_err_lines` is crucial as it interprets error specifications. Additionally, the function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` processes the lines from the QDP file and identifies command lines. Both these functions need to be modified to handle case-insensitive commands. Furthermore, the `_read_table_qdp` function orchestrates the reading process and should be checked for any case sensitivity issues. This approach will ensure that the code can handle QDP files with commands in any case, thereby resolving the reported issue.",
