These functions handle the parsing of QDP commands, storage of error specifications, and creation of tables. The identified spans include the code blocks that parse and interpret commands, which is where the change to support case insensitivity should be made.

The primary concern is that the ascii.qdp module assumes QDP commands are in uppercase, which conflicts with the case-insensitive nature of QDP. To resolve this, the relevant part of the code to modify is the command parsing within the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function. This function interprets the QDP commands and needs to be adjusted to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. The current implementation directly checks commands in their original case, leading to the described error with lowercase commands. Modifying this function to treat commands without regard to case would fix the issue. Since the relevant module and the specific line of code where the issue arises (interpreting QDP commands) have been identified, the response concludes with a decision that all relevant file context has been provided and the task is complete.",

  "initial_message": "ascii.qdp Table format assumes QDP commands are upper case\n### Description\n\nascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case, for example, for errors they must be \"READ SERR 1 2\" whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive and case use \"read serr 1 2\". \r\n\r\nAs many QDP files are created by hand, the expectation that all commands be all-caps should be removed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe following qdp file should read into a `Table` with errors, rather than crashing.\r\n```\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nCreate a QDP file:\r\n```\r\n> cat > test.qdp\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n<EOF>\r\n\r\n > python\r\nPython 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from astropy.table import Table\r\n>>> Table.read('test.qdp',format='ascii.qdp')\r\nWARNING: table_id not specified.
