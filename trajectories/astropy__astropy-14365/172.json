Specifically, the code currently expects commands to be in upper case, but QDP itself is not case sensitive. This results in a `ValueError` when trying to read a QDP file with lower case commands. The relevant code spans that need to be updated to handle case-insensitive commands are those that interpret and process QDP command lines. These include the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function and its dependencies such as '_interpret_err_lines' and '_read_table_qdp'. By reviewing these functions, I identified the need to modify the command parsing logic to account for case insensitivity. This involves ensuring that the commands are processed irrespective of their case, thereby preventing the `ValueError` and allowing the QDP file to be read correctly. The provided code spans include the necessary functions where these changes should be implemented.
