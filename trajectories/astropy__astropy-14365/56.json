Specifically, the QDP file parser expects commands to be in upper case, but QDP itself is case insensitive. This can lead to crashes when reading QDP files with commands in lower case or mixed case. The relevant files to investigate would be those handling the parsing and interpretation of QDP files, particularly those in the astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py file and possibly others that interact with QDP format files or the QDP reader. It's also useful to look into the _read_table_qdp and _write_table_qdp functions within the qdp.py file, as well as any related classes like QDPSplitter and QDPData. The goal is to identify where the parser is being too strict with case sensitivity and update it to handle case insensitivity.",

The expected behavior is that a QDP file with lower case commands should be read into a Table without crashing. The relevant code spans to address this issue would be those that handle QDP command interpretation and data reading. In the provided search results, the function _get_tables_from_qdp_file seems to be the main function handling the reading of QDP files, specifically where it processes command lines. Also, the _read_table_qdp function interacts directly with this to read tables based on QDP files. Therefore, these two functions and their handling of command line parsing need to be adjusted to make case-insensitive interpretations of QDP commands.",
