'_get_tables_from_qdp_file': This function processes the QDP file contents, including commands and data lines. The part of this function that interprets command lines is critical. 2. '_read_table_qdp': This function reads a QDP table, handling table IDs and invoking '_get_tables_from_qdp_file'. Understanding how it interacts with the lower-level function is important. 3. 'QDP.read': Although directly not handling case sensitivity, it reads the table and might expose issues during runtime if the case sensitivity problem is not addressed. These spans together provide a clear view of the command processing logic in the `ascii.qdp` format, demonstrating where the update to handle case-insensitive commands should be made.",
