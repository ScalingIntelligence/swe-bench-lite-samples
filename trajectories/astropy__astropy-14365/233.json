            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates that the ascii.qdp table format in the astropy library assumes QDP commands to be upper case, whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive. This leads to errors when reading QDP files that use mixed or lower case commands, such as 'read serr 1 2'. The task is to identify the code spans in the provided search results that are relevant to this issue. The search results include several functions and classes, including '_read_table_qdp', '_write_table_qdp', 'QDP', 'QDP.__init__', 'QDP.read', and 'QDP.write'. \n\nRelevant functions would be those that handle reading and writing QDP files, specifically '_read_table_qdp' and '_write_table_qdp', as these are directly responsible for interpreting and producing QDP files. The 'QDP' class and its methods 'QDP.read' and 'QDP.write' are also relevant as they interface with these lower-level functions. The span '_write_table_qdp' contains the code that writes QDP commands in upper case, which directly relates to the issue of case sensitivity. Thus, these spans need to be reviewed and potentially modified to accommodate case-insensitive QDP commands.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans are '_read_table_qdp', '_write_table_qdp', 'QDP.read', and 'QDP.write', as they are central to the reading and writing of QDP files and are likely to contain the necessary code modifications to resolve the case sensitivity issue. No further code spans are identified as necessary beyond those already provided in the search results.",
