Specifically, the `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function processes lines from the QDP file and identifies commands, which currently strip and split the lines in a case-sensitive manner. This function is called by `_read_table_qdp`, which handles the reading of a specific table from the QDP file. Both of these functions are part of the `astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py` file, which also contains the `QDP` class and its `read` method for handling input lines. Given the issue's description, these functions, especially `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, need to be adjusted to handle commands in a case-insensitive way.

The user provided an example where the reader crashes because it expects 'READ SERR 1 2' instead of 'read serr 1 2'. This indicates that the reader is not correctly interpreting command lines with different cases. From the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are those that handle command interpretation and error specifications. The functions '_get_lines_from_file', '_interpret_err_lines', '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', and '_read_table_qdp' are directly involved in reading and interpreting QDP files. The specific part that needs attention is the handling of command lines in the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function, where commands are read and interpreted. By analyzing the function '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', it is clear that the code currently does not handle case sensitivity for commands. This suggests that modifications to these functions to accommodate case-insensitive command interpretation are necessary. The identified line in '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' reads 'err_specs[command[1].lower()] = [int(c) for c in command[2:]]', which indicates the code might already have a partial implementation for case insensitivity by using the 'lower()' method.
