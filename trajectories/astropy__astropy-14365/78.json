The current implementation assumes that commands are upper case, which is not consistent with the case insensitivity of QDP. This causes errors when reading QDP files with lowercase commands. The relevant sections of code to address this issue are the reading and writing functions in the `qdp.py` file. Specifically, the `_read_table_qdp` and `_write_table_qdp` functions need to be modified to handle case-insensitive commands. Additionally, the `QDP` class and its methods `read` and `write` are also relevant as they interact directly with these functions.
