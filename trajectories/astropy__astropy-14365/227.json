The issue can be addressed by making the QDP command parsing case-insensitive. The search results reveal key parts of the codebase that are relevant to this issue. The `_read_table_qdp` function reads the QDP file and processes its contents. The `QDP` class and its methods (`__init__` and `read`) are responsible for handling the reading of the QDP files. These parts of the code are responsible for processing the QDP commands and should be adjusted to handle case-insensitivity. By modifying these sections to be case-insensitive, the expected behavior of reading QDP files regardless of the case of the commands can be achieved.",
