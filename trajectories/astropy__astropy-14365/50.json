The search results provided contain several functions and methods that are relevant to reading and interpreting QDP files. Specifically, the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function is central to reading QDP files and interpreting commands within them. The code block associated with the 'command' datatype in this function is the most relevant, as it handles the parsing of QDP commands. To resolve the issue, it is likely necessary to adjust this part of the code to make command parsing case-insensitive. The '_read_table_qdp' function, which calls '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', is also relevant as it handles the reading of the QDP file into a Table. Additionally, the '_get_lines_from_file' function, which reads the QDP file and splits it into lines, could be relevant if there are changes needed in how the file is read. The '_interpret_err_lines' function, while not directly related to command parsing, could become relevant if changes to command parsing affect the interpretation of error lines.
