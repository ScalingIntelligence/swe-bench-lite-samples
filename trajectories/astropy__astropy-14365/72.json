            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue states that the ascii.qdp parser expects QDP commands to be in upper case, whereas the QDP format itself is not case-sensitive. This discrepancy can cause errors when reading QDP files that use lower-case commands. The relevant code spans identified in the search results are primarily in the functions `_read_table_qdp` and `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`. These functions are responsible for reading and interpreting QDP files. Specifically, the issue involves how commands are processed within these functions. The function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` processes each line of the QDP file and categorizes it as either 'comment', 'command', or 'data'. The 'command' category currently expects the commands to be in upper case, which is the source of the problem. To resolve this, the code needs to be modified to treat commands in a case-insensitive manner. This adjustment can be made by converting commands to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) for internal processing, thus ensuring that commands like 'read serr 1 2' are recognized in addition to 'READ SERR 1 2'. The specific code span to focus on is the part of the function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` that handles 'command' lines: 'command = cline.strip().split()', where commands are currently processed in their original case. Making this part of the code case-insensitive will resolve the reported issue.",
