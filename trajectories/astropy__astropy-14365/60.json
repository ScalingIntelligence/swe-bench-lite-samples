This is problematic because QDP itself is case-insensitive and expects commands in any case. The search results reveal relevant code spans that can be modified to address this issue. Specifically, the function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` contains logic for processing command lines. The code should be modified to recognize and process commands in a case-insensitive manner. Additionally, the `QDP` class and its methods `__init__` and `read` need to be examined for any case-sensitive processing that could be modified. These sections of code are crucial for handling the reading and interpretation of QDP files, and by processing commands in a case-insensitive manner, a more robust and user-friendly implementation can be achieved.",
