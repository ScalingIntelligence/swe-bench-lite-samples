Specifically, it is noted that the current implementation expects commands to be in uppercase, which contradicts the actual case insensitivity of QDP files. The expected behavior is that lowercased commands should also be recognized. Reviewing the provided search results, the file `astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py` contains the relevant code spans that handle the interpretation of QDP commands and the creation of tables from QDP files. The identified code spans include functions '_interpret_err_lines', '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', '_read_table_qdp', as well as the class 'QDP' and its method 'read'. These sections of code are directly responsible for parsing QDP files, interpreting commands, and creating tables. Focusing on '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', it processes lines from the QDP file, identifies commands, and determines the error specifications. This is the primary location where the case sensitivity of commands needs to be addressed to ensure that both uppercase and lowercase commands are handled equivalently. The relevant code spans in the provided search results are adequate to address the reported issue, as they encapsulate the necessary functionality to read and process QDP files, including handling commands and creating tables based on those commands.",
