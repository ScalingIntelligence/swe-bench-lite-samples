The relevant code spans that need to be modified to address this issue should ideally focus on the command interpretation logic in the QDP file parsing. Specifically, the _get_tables_from_qdp_file function and its helper functions (_get_lines_from_file and _interpret_err_lines) are the likely candidates for modifications. These functions handle the parsing and interpretation of QDP commands. The current logic in _get_tables_from_qdp_file reads and splits QDP command lines, but it does not currently handle case insensitivity as required by the issue. The _read_table_qdp function, which calls _get_tables_from_qdp_file, also needs to be considered as it is the primary interface for reading QDP files. Modifying these functions to handle command case insensitivity will likely resolve the issue. Additional review of the QDP class and its associated methods (QDPSplitter, QDPHeader, QDPData) may be necessary to ensure that no other parts of the codebase are enforcing case sensitivity for QDP commands. Given the identified issues, modifying the _get_tables_from_qdp_file function and its interaction with QDP commands appears to be the most direct route to resolve the reported issue.",
