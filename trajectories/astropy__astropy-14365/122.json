The issue suggests that this requirement for uppercase commands should be removed to handle mixed-case commands. The provided search results contain several spans that are relevant to this issue, particularly those dealing with parsing QDP files and interpreting commands within them.\n\nIn '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and '_read_table_qdp', the code handles reading QDP files and processing commands. However, it appears to rely on the commands being in a specific format, which might be case sensitive. This section of the code is crucial for addressing the reported issue as it involves interpreting and acting upon commands in the QDP file. By ensuring that these functions can handle mixed-case commands, the bug described in the issue can be resolved. This could involve modifying the command interpretation logic to be case-insensitive, or updating how commands are parsed during file reading.\n\nOther sections such as 'QDPHeader', 'QDPData', and 'QDP' class definitions and their methods play a role in the overall QDP file handling but do not directly address the case-sensitivity of commands.\n\nThus, the identified spans focus on the parts of the codebase that parse and interpret QDP commands, which are central to resolving the issue.",

The expected behavior is that the QDP file should be read into a `Table` with errors, even if the commands are not all-caps. Analyzing the provided code spans, the relevant sections include `_get_lines_from_file`, `_interpret_err_lines`, `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, `_read_table_qdp`, and `QDP`. These functions handle reading the QDP file, interpreting error lines, and generating tables. Notably, in `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, the command parsing does not currently account for case insensitivity, as it processes commands like 'serr' and 'terr' in a case-sensitive manner. This analysis suggests that the relevant code spans that need adjustment to implement the expected behavior are `_get_lines_from_file`, `_interpret_err_lines`, and `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`.",
