This can cause issues when reading QDP files with lower case commands. The expected behavior is that lower case commands should also be recognized, ensuring that the QDP file reads into a Table without errors. The provided search results contain several functions related to reading and interpreting QDP files. The function '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' appears to be particularly relevant, as it handles the parsing of QDP commands and data lines. Within this function, the commands are being interpreted, and it is likely where the case sensitivity issue arises. The function '_interpret_err_lines' is also relevant, as it deals with interpreting error specifications from the commands. To address the issue, these functions should be reviewed and modified to handle both upper and lower case commands, ensuring that the reading process is case insensitive.",
