This assumption can cause errors when reading QDP files created manually with lower-case commands. The expected behavior is that the reader should handle case insensitivity for commands like 'read serr 1 2'. The relevant code spans identified in the search results are related to the parsing and interpretation of QDP files, specifically the handling of commands and errors. The key functions to consider are `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and `_interpret_err_lines`. The first function processes the lines from a QDP file and identifies commands, while the second function interprets the error specifications. These functions must be modified to ensure that they handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. Additionally, the `_read_table_qdp` function is responsible for reading the QDP file and selecting the appropriate table, which also needs to account for case insensitivity. The identified code spans are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue, but modifications and additional tests will be necessary to fully address the case insensitivity requirement.",
