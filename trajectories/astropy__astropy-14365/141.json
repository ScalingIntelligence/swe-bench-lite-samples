This issue can be addressed by ensuring that the module does not enforce uppercase commands. I analyzed the provided code spans and identified several key areas that need to be modified to support case-insensitive command handling. Specifically, the _get_tables_from_qdp_file function is responsible for parsing the QDP file lines and interpreting commands. The command handling logic inside this function should be updated to be case-insensitive. This involves modifying the parsing of command lines to convert them to a common case before comparison. Additionally, the _interpret_err_lines function, which processes error specifications, should also be checked for case sensitivity to ensure it correctly interprets commands regardless of their case. The identified spans are crucial for implementing the necessary changes to support case-insensitive QDP command handling.",
