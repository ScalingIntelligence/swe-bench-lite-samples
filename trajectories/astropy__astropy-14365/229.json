The current implementation in the provided code expects QDP commands to be upper case, which does not align with the case insensitivity of QDP itself. This discrepancy leads to a crash when processing QDP files with lower-case commands, which are valid in QDP but not handled correctly in the current code. The relevant code spans identified deal with reading QDP files and handling QDP commands. Specifically, the _read_table_qdp function is responsible for reading the QDP file and should be modified to handle case-insensitive commands. The QDP class encapsulates the QDP format handling, and the read method within this class processes the QDP file. These methods need to be adjusted to correctly parse QDP commands regardless of their case, thereby resolving the reported issue. This adjustment will ensure that QDP files with lower-case commands can be read into a Table without crashing.",

  "initial_message": "ascii.qdp Table format assumes QDP commands are upper case\n### Description\n\nascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case, for example, for errors they must be \"READ SERR 1 2\" whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive and case use \"read serr 1 2\". \r\n\r\nAs many QDP files are created by hand, the expectation that all commands be all-caps should be removed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe following qdp file should read into a `Table` with errors, rather than crashing.\r\n```\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nCreate a QDP file:\r\n```\r\n> cat > test.qdp\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n<EOF>\r\n\r\n > python\r\nPython 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from astropy.table import Table\r\n>>> Table.read('test.qdp',format='ascii.qdp')\r\nWARNING: table_id not specified.
