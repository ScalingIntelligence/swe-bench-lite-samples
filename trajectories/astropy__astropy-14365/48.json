  "initial_message": "ascii.qdp Table format assumes QDP commands are upper case\n### Description\n\nascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case, for example, for errors they must be \"READ SERR 1 2\" whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive and case use \"read serr 1 2\". \r\n\r\nAs many QDP files are created by hand, the expectation that all commands be all-caps should be removed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe following qdp file should read into a `Table` with errors, rather than crashing.\r\n```\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nCreate a QDP file:\r\n```\r\n> cat > test.qdp\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n<EOF>\r\n\r\n > python\r\nPython 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from astropy.table import Table\r\n>>> Table.read('test.qdp',format='ascii.qdp')\r\nWARNING: table_id not specified.
