The relevant parts of the code appear to be `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, `_read_table_qdp`, and `_write_table_qdp` functions, as they handle reading from and writing to QDP files. Specifically, the `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function processes commands from the QDP file, which should be evaluated for case-insensitive handling. The other functions rely on this for the actual I/O operations, so they are also relevant.
