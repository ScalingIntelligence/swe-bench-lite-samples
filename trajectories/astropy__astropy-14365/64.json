This strictness causes problems when reading QDP files that use lowercase commands, as these do not match the expected uppercase format. The search results reveal several key sections of the code that handle reading and writing QDP files, specifically in the functions _read_table_qdp and _write_table_qdp. These functions process QDP files, interpreting commands like 'READ SERR' and 'READ TERR', which currently expect uppercase. To address the issue, the code handling these commands (specifically the parts that print or expect 'READ SERR' and 'READ TERR') should be modified to be case-insensitive. This would allow the reader to correctly interpret and process QDP files with commands in different cases without raising errors. Other sections, like the QDP class and its methods, primarily manage table reading and writing, but they depend on the functionality provided by _read_table_qdp and _write_table_qdp. Thus, focusing on these two functions is crucial for fixing the issue.",
