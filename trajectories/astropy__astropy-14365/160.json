The search results provide a direct line of sight into the relevant sections of the codebase that handle the reading and processing of QDP files, specifically the functions `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and `_read_table_qdp`. The function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` processes the lines from the QDP file and interprets commands, which currently assumes upper case commands. This function's handling of command lines and the subsequent data processing within the same function suggests that modifying this function to handle case-insensitive commands could resolve the issue. The `_read_table_qdp` function, which calls `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, also needs to be considered in the context of this change. Based on the reported issue, focusing changes around these functions would address the requirement for case-insensitive command handling.",

  "initial_message": "ascii.qdp Table format assumes QDP commands are upper case\n### Description\n\nascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case, for example, for errors they must be \"READ SERR 1 2\" whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive and case use \"read serr 1 2\". \r\n\r\nAs many QDP files are created by hand, the expectation that all commands be all-caps should be removed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe following qdp file should read into a `Table` with errors, rather than crashing.\r\n```\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nCreate a QDP file:\r\n```\r\n> cat > test.qdp\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n<EOF>\r\n\r\n > python\r\nPython 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from astropy.table import Table\r\n>>> Table.read('test.qdp',format='ascii.qdp')\r\nWARNING: table_id not specified.
