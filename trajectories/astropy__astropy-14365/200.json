The current implementation expects commands to be in uppercase, which conflicts with the case insensitivity of QDP itself. This leads to crashes when attempting to read a QDP file with lowercase commands. To address this, the relevant code spans involve interpreting error lines, reading tables from a QDP file, and handling the QDP file format. Specifically, the functions `_interpret_err_lines`, `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, and `_read_table_qdp` are crucial for reading and interpreting QDP files. These functions need to be modified to ensure case insensitivity when parsing commands. Additionally, the `QDP` class and its methods for reading and writing, namely `QDP.read` and `QDP.write`, are part of the class responsible for handling QDP files. They utilize the internally defined functions to perform their tasks and thus need attention. Identifying these code spans will provide the necessary context to modify the code and remove the requirement for uppercase commands, thereby resolving the issue.",

These functions handle the reading and parsing of QDP files and include logic for interpreting error specifications (e.g., 'serr' and 'terr').

  "initial_message": "ascii.qdp Table format assumes QDP commands are upper case\n### Description\n\nascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case, for example, for errors they must be \"READ SERR 1 2\" whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive and case use \"read serr 1 2\". \r\n\r\nAs many QDP files are created by hand, the expectation that all commands be all-caps should be removed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe following qdp file should read into a `Table` with errors, rather than crashing.\r\n```\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nCreate a QDP file:\r\n```\r\n> cat > test.qdp\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n<EOF>\r\n\r\n > python\r\nPython 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from astropy.table import Table\r\n>>> Table.read('test.qdp',format='ascii.qdp')\r\nWARNING: table_id not specified. Reading the first available table [astropy.io.ascii.qdp]\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\n    raise ValueError(f'Unrecognized QDP line: {line}')\r\nValueError: Unrecognized QDP line: read serr 1 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning \"qdp test.qdp\" works just fine.\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\nPython 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)]\r\nastropy 5.1\r\nNumpy 1.24.1\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.1\r\nScipy 1.10.0\r\nMatplotlib 3.6.3\r\n\n"
