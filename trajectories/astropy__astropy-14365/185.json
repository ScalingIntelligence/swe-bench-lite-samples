The code needs to be modified to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. The relevant code spans identified in the search results are part of the function _get_tables_from_qdp_file, which processes the QDP file lines and interprets commands. This function currently processes commands by splitting lines and directly using them, which leads to the case sensitivity issue. The _read_table_qdp function also directly calls _get_tables_from_qdp_file, indicating it is likely where the modification should be made to introduce case insensitivity. The QDP class and its read method are also relevant as they handle the reading of the table, but the core issue seems to be in the handling of commands within _get_tables_from_qdp_file.",
