The new search results confirm the presence of these functions, indicating that the code responsible for interpreting QDP commands and constructing tables from QDP files is within these spans.

This function processes QDP commands, stores specifications for errors in `err_specs`, and then interprets these to generate column names.

The search results contain similar functions and methods that are relevant to reading QDP files. The _get_tables_from_qdp_file function processes commands and data from QDP files, which is directly related to the issue. Specifically, the lines where command processing occurs (inside the 'command' datatype check) are likely where the case sensitivity issue needs to be addressed by making the command interpretation case-insensitive.

The '_interpret_err_lines' function handles the interpretation of error specifications and is a key part of handling QDP commands. The '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and '_read_table_qdp' functions are also critical as they process the QDP file and read the table data. These functions need to be modified to handle case insensitive commands. Additionally, the 'QDPHeader' and 'QDPData' classes in the search results are likely involved in how headers and data are processed in the QDP format, which may also need adjustments for case insensitivity. The 'QDP' class, which initializes the QDP reader with options and reads the table, will also need to accommodate changes for case insensitive commands.
