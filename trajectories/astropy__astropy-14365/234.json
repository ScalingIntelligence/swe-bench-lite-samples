The current implementation in `astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py` assumes that commands are upper case, which is not consistent with the case insensitivity of QDP files. The relevant sections of the code include functions for reading and interpreting QDP files and lines, specifically `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, `_read_table_qdp`, and `_interpret_err_lines`. These functions handle the parsing of QDP commands and data, and they need to be updated to be case-insensitive. Additionally, the `_write_table_qdp` function, which writes QDP files, also needs to be considered to ensure that it does not enforce uppercase commands when writing files. The spans identified include those handling command interpretation and table creation from QDP files, which are crucial for addressing the issue.",
