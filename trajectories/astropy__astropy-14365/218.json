The current implementation in `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` only recognizes uppercase QDP commands, leading to errors when lowercase commands are used. The relevant code spans to address this issue are those that process the commands (`datatype == 'command'`) and those that interpret these commands (`_interpret_err_lines`). Additionally, the `_read_table_qdp` function is relevant as it uses `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` to read the QDP file. The other spans like `QDPHeader`, `QDPData`, `QDP`, and `QDP.__init__` are related to the QDP format but seem less directly involved in the case sensitivity issue described. To resolve the issue, the processing of QDP commands should be modified to be case-insensitive, likely by converting the commands to a common case (either upper or lower) before interpreting them.",

  "initial_message": "ascii.qdp Table format assumes QDP commands are upper case\n### Description\n\nascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case, for example, for errors they must be \"READ SERR 1 2\" whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive and case use \"read serr 1 2\". \r\n\r\nAs many QDP files are created by hand, the expectation that all commands be all-caps should be removed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe following qdp file should read into a `Table` with errors, rather than crashing.\r\n```\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nCreate a QDP file:\r\n```\r\n> cat > test.qdp\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n<EOF>\r\n\r\n > python\r\nPython 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from astropy.table import Table\r\n>>> Table.read('test.qdp',format='ascii.qdp')\r\nWARNING: table_id not specified.
