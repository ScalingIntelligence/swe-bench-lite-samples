Currently, the code assumes that QDP commands are in upper case, which is not consistent with the standard usage of QDP files. The goal is to modify the code to be case-insensitive when interpreting QDP commands. Relevant files likely include those defining the QDP reader functionality, particularly those that handle the parsing of QDP file commands and the extraction of table data from such files. Thus, a search should focus on the `qdp.py` file and related functions/classes within it that deal with reading QDP files and interpreting commands.",

The expected behavior is for the QDP reader to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. The relevant section of the code appears to be the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function, which processes the QDP file lines and identifies commands. Currently, the function processes commands by splitting the line and checking the contents directly. To resolve the issue, the function needs to be modified to handle command lines in a case-insensitive manner, likely by converting all command strings to a common case (e.g., lower or upper) before comparing or processing them. This change should ensure that the QDP reader can handle commands written in any case without raising errors. Additionally, the '_read_table_qdp' function needs to ensure it correctly calls the modified '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function. Other parts of the 'QDP' class, such as the 'read' method, may also need to be adjusted to align with the new handling of command lines, although they do not directly interact with the command handling in the provided context.",

The codebase currently expects commands to be in upper case, which is contrary to QDP's case insensitivity as per the issue. To resolve this, we need to address the part of the code that interprets QDP commands and make it case-insensitive. The relevant code spans are:_interpret_err_lines, which handles the interpretation of error spec commands, and potentially _get_tables_from_qdp_file where these specs are applied. Also, modifying the part of the code that processes commands in _get_tables_from_qdp_file to be case-insensitive would be necessary. From the search results, the _interpret_err_lines function directly deals with the command specifications, while the _get_tables_from_qdp_file function processes these commands. Both spans are critical for making the code handle QDP commands in a case-insensitive manner, aligning with the reported issue.",
