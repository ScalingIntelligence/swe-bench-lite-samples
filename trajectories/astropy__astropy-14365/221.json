The current implementation in `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function seems to expect commands to be in upper case, which is not case-insensitive as per the QDP standard. The function processes commands and stores them in `err_specs`, but it currently assumes commands are in upper case. This assumption is problematic because it causes errors when lower-case commands are encountered. Additionally, the `_read_table_qdp` function calls `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and handles the reading of tables, making it also relevant to address the case sensitivity issue. Therefore, both `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and `_read_table_qdp` functions need to be modified to handle case-insensitive commands. This could be achieved by converting all command strings to lower case before processing them. Since the `QDP` class and its `read` method are part of the broader reading process, they also need to be considered in the context of modifying the reading functionality to handle case-insensitive QDP commands.",
