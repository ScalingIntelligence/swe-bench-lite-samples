The issue states that 'ascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case', and there's a ValueError when encountering non-uppercase commands. I should look for code that processes commands and potentially stores or interprets them in the QDP reader. The function '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' seems to be a key part of the process as it deals with lines from a QDP file and categorizes them into 'command', 'data', etc. To resolve the issue, the code must be altered to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. The command parsing process could be found in the 'command' datatype handling section within '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', particularly around the line splitting and command interpretation. The '_read_table_qdp' function also points to where the tables are retrieved and parsed, making it relevant for understanding the full process.",
