To address this, the relevant code span appears to be within the `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function, specifically where it processes 'command' data types. This is where the commands from the QDP file are read and interpreted. Currently, the commands are assumed to be in all caps, which causes the issue when lower case commands are encountered. Additionally, the `_read_table_qdp` function is relevant as it calls `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and is part of the reading process. Adjustments in these areas would be necessary to ensure that commands are processed in a case-insensitive manner, allowing for both upper and lower case commands.",

  "initial_message": "ascii.qdp Table format assumes QDP commands are upper case\n### Description\n\nascii.qdp assumes that commands in a QDP file are upper case, for example, for errors they must be \"READ SERR 1 2\" whereas QDP itself is not case sensitive and case use \"read serr 1 2\". \r\n\r\nAs many QDP files are created by hand, the expectation that all commands be all-caps should be removed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe following qdp file should read into a `Table` with errors, rather than crashing.\r\n```\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n```\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nCreate a QDP file:\r\n```\r\n> cat > test.qdp\r\nread serr 1 2 \r\n1 0.5 1 0.5\r\n<EOF>\r\n\r\n > python\r\nPython 3.10.9 (main, Dec  7 2022, 02:03:23) [Clang 13.0.0 (clang-1300.0.29.30)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> from astropy.table import Table\r\n>>> Table.read('test.qdp',format='ascii.qdp')\r\nWARNING: table_id not specified.
