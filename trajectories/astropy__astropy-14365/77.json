To address this, we need to identify sections of code responsible for reading and interpreting QDP commands. The search results reveal several relevant code spans, particularly in the 'astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py' file. The '_read_table_qdp function' is a key entry point for reading QDP files and uses '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' to parse the file. This function's implementation should be inspected further to make sure it handles commands in a case-insensitive manner. Additionally, the 'QDP' class and its methods 'read' and 'write' are pertinent as they define how QDP files are read and written. These methods should be updated to ensure case-insensitivity. The other files and code spans are related to different readers and their implementations, which, while relevant for the broader context of ASCII file reading, are not directly related to the QDP reader's case sensitivity issue.",
