The relevant code spans should be identified from within the `astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py` file, specifically focusing on the functions responsible for reading and interpreting QDP files. This includes `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, `_read_table_qdp`, and potentially `QDP.read` if it involves direct interaction with the reading process. These functions are central to processing the input QDP file and converting it into an astropy `Table`. The identified issue suggests that the current implementation is too strict about the case of the commands, which needs to be adjusted to not assume all commands are upper case. To address this, the relevant code spans should include the logic that interprets QDP commands and checks their format.",
