To resolve this, the relevant section of code to modify would be where the QDP commands are being processed. Specifically, the function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` contains the logic for parsing these commands. The line where commands are split and processed should be modified to treat command strings in a case-insensitive manner. Additionally, the `_read_table_qdp` function initializes the reading process, so understanding its connection to `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` is crucial for a complete solution. The `QDP.read` method is not directly related to this issue but shows how table reading is initiated, which might be relevant for broader context. Identifying the appropriate handling of case sensitivity in the `err_specs` dictionary or similar structures where command details are stored seems essential. No other files are currently in the context, indicating that the focus should remain on this file to correct the handling of QDP command cases. Hence, the identified spans contain the core functionality affected by this issue.",

This leads to a scenario where a QDP file created with lower case commands, such as 'read serr 1 2', causes the reader to raise a ValueError. To resolve this, the code needs to be modified to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. Inspecting the current context and new search results, the relevant functions handling QDP file parsing are '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', '_interpret_err_lines', and '_read_table_qdp'. These functions need to be updated to process command lines without considering the case of the commands. Specifically, 'err_specs[command[1].lower()] = [int(c) for c in command[2:]]' line in '_interpret_err_lines' should be particularly noted as this where the command's case sensitivity is directly handled.
