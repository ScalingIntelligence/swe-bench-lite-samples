The search results contain several key functions and classes related to reading and writing QDP files: _read_table_qdp, _write_table_qdp, QDP, and QDPHeader. Notably, the function _write_table_qdp uses uppercase commands ('READ SERR' and 'READ TERR') when writing QDP files, adhering to the expected behavior but without considering the case insensitivity of the actual QDP specification. This suggests the issue likely resides within the _read_table_qdp function's parsing logic or the QDPHeader class's handling of command lines. Specifically, the QDPHeader class is responsible for parsing the header and command lines, which likely includes handling of 'READ SERR' and similar commands. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that handle the parsing of command lines in a case-sensitive manner, which need to be updated or adjusted to be case-insensitive.",

The current implementation seems to expect uppercase commands, which causes a ValueError when encountering lowercase commands. Key parts of the code that handle command interpretation and error specs include '_get_lines_from_file', '_interpret_err_lines', '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', and '_read_table_qdp'. The relevant code spans to address this issue are those that process command lines and interpret them, particularly how commands are split and interpreted in '_get_tables_from_qdp_file'. Additionally, '_interpret_err_lines' processes error specifications, which may need adjustments to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. Adjusting the processing of command lines in '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and ensuring that commands like 'serr' and 'terr' (regardless of case) are correctly identified and processed will be crucial to resolving this issue.
