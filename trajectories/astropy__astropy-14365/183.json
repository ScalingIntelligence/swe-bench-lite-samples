Through analysis of the search results, it is apparent that the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function is responsible for parsing the QDP file and interpreting commands. Specifically, within this function, the commands are currently being processed with the expectation that they are in upper case. This can be seen where the 'command' datatype is processed: the command variable is split from the line without considering case sensitivity. To resolve the issue, the function should be modified to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner, likely by converting the command input to a standard case (e.g., lower) before processing. This change should be implemented without altering the functionality of interpreting error specifications and data lines. The '_read_table_qdp' function, which calls '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', may also need adjustments to accommodate changes made in the handling of case sensitivity for commands. The QDP class and its method 'read' are part of the broader processing but are less directly involved in the case sensitivity issue reported.",
