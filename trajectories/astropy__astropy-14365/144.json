The primary functions involved in reading and interpreting QDP files are _get_tables_from_qdp_file, which orchestrates the reading of the file, and _interpret_err_lines, which interprets error specifications. Additionally, the _read_table_qdp function and the QDP class's read method are crucial for handling the reading and input of the QDP tables. The critical step here is to make the parsing of command lines case-insensitive to accommodate mixed or lowercase commands, which is currently not implemented and leads to the described error. The relevant code spans that need to be adjusted are those that process command lines and interpret their directives, particularly in the _interpret_err_lines function and within the loop that processes command lines in _get_tables_from_qdp_file. Adjustments should ensure that commands like 'read serr' are recognized equally to 'READ SERR'.",
