The current implementation expects commands to be upper case, which is not consistent with the actual QDP format's case insensitivity. This case sensitivity is causing errors when reading QDP files that use lower or mixed case commands.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are those that handle the reading and interpretation of QDP commands. The 'span_ids' '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', '_read_table_qdp', and '_write_table_qdp' contain the core logic for parsing QDP files. These spans are responsible for interpreting commands, handling errors, and defining the structure of the tables to be read or written. The other spans, such as those related to headers, data, and the QDP class initialization, while important for overall functionality, are not directly relevant to the specific case sensitivity issue reported.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the case sensitivity issue are those that handle the parsing and interpretation of QDP commands within the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and '_read_table_qdp' functions. These spans need to be modified to ensure they process QDP commands in a case-insensitive manner, thereby resolving the reported issue.",
