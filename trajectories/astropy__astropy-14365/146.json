Specifically, the '_get_lines_from_file' function is responsible for reading the lines from the QDP file, and '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' processes these lines to create tables. The '_interpret_err_lines' function interprets error specifications, which is crucial for handling commands like 'read serr 1 2'. The '_read_table_qdp' function reads a QDP table based on an ID, and the 'QDP.read' method in the QDP class is likely where file reading operations are initiated.

This is problematic because QDP files can be manually created and may contain lower-case commands, leading to errors. The task is to identify the relevant parts of the code responsible for reading and interpreting QDP commands and to ensure they are not case-sensitive. From the provided context, several functions are related to the reading and interpretation of QDP files: `_get_lines_from_file`, `_interpret_err_lines`, `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, and `_read_table_qdp`. These functions handle reading the file, interpreting error lines, and constructing tables from the QDP file. In the search results, the function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` is particularly relevant as it contains the logic for processing command lines and defining error specifications (`err_specs`). Modifications to this function and related utilities will likely be necessary to make the QDP command parsing case-insensitive. Identified spans include the code responsible for splitting and interpreting commands within the QDP file.",
