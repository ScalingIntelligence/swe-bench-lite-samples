The user expects that the QDP reader should handle commands in any case, and provides an example QDP file with lower-case commands. The relevant code spans identified deal with the interpretation of error lines and the reading of QDP files. The function `_interpret_err_lines` determines the column names based on the error specifications, and the function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` processes the QDP file to extract tables. The function `_read_table_qdp` is responsible for reading a specific table from the QDP file. These functions need to be updated to account for case-insensitive command handling, specifically in the part of the code where commands are parsed and interpreted.
