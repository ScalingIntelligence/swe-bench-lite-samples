The provided search results contain code spanning three main sections: the _read_table_qdp function, the QDP class, and the QDP class's read method. The _read_table_qdp function is central to reading QDP files and handling table IDs, which is relevant to the issue's description about handling QDP files and potential errors. The QDP class and its read method are also relevant as they define the behavior of reading QDP files. These sections of code need to be reviewed and potentially modified to handle QDP commands in a case-insensitive manner, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue. Thus, these spans are likely to be the most relevant to the reported issue, as they directly involve the reading and processing of QDP files.",
