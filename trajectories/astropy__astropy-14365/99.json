This assumption is problematic because QDP itself is not case sensitive and commands can be in any case. The expected behavior is that a QDP file with lowercase commands should be read into a `Table` without crashing. The provided search results include the `_read_table_qdp` and `_write_table_qdp` functions, which handle reading from and writing to QDP files. The functions currently expect uppercase commands, as seen in the `_write_table_qdp` function, which writes 'READ SERR' and 'READ TERR' commands. The `_read_table_qdp` function, which reads from the QDP file, likely has a mechanism for parsing commands, and this is where the case sensitivity issue would need to be addressed. Additionally, the `QDP` class and its methods `read` and `write` interact with these functions. To resolve the issue, the parsing logic in `_read_table_qdp` or potentially in helper functions like those responsible for getting tables from the QDP file (`_get_tables_from_qdp_file`) should be modified to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. This would allow QDP files with lowercase commands to be read without errors. Therefore, the focus should be on these functions and the logic they use to parse and understand QDP commands.",

Analyzing the provided search results, we find several functions that are relevant: `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, `_read_table_qdp`, and `_write_table_qdp`. These functions handle the parsing and interpretation of QDP commands, which are central to the issue. Particularly, the function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` processes each line of the input file and categorizes them as either 'comment', 'command', or 'data'. The issue likely arises when processing 'command' lines, where the current implementation expects commands to be in upper case. Therefore, we need to identify the specific span where commands are parsed and ensure they are treated without case sensitivity.

This means we need to modify the code that reads and interprets these commands. Based on the context provided in <file_context> and the new search results in <search_results>, the relevant sections of code are found in the functions _get_lines_from_file, _interpret_err_lines, _get_tables_from_qdp_file, and _read_table_qdp. These functions handle the reading and parsing of QDP files, including interpreting command lines. Specifically, in _get_tables_from_qdp_file, the commands are processed and stored in err_specs.
