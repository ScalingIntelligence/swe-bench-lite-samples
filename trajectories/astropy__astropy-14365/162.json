The key focus is on modifying the reader to be case-insensitive. In the provided search results, several code spans are relevant:\n\n1. '_read_table_qdp': This function is directly responsible for reading a QDP file and constructing a table from it. It uses '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', which is not shown but is likely where the case sensitivity issue resides.\n\n2. 'QDP': This class represents the QDP format within the ascii reader. It initializes with parameters related to table reading and handling, such as 'table_id', 'names', and 'err_specs'.\n\n3. 'QDP.read': This method is crucial as it initiates the reading process. It uses '_read_table_qdp' internally, indicating that modifications here could propagate changes to the reading logic to handle case-insensitivity.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they directly involve reading and interpreting QDP files, which aligns with the issue description requiring a change in how commands are interpreted for case sensitivity. Further investigation would involve looking at how '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' processes lines and how the QDP reader processes command lines. However, based on the reported issue, these are the primary targets for modification.",
