Given the description of the issue, the relevant code spans are those that define the QDP class and its methods for reading files.

In the search results, there are several relevant sections, especially those dealing with the reading of QDP files and interpreting commands ('_read_table_qdp', 'QDP.read'). However, the specific logic that handles the command interpretation and might be case-sensitive is crucial. The '_read_table_qdp' function calls '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', which contains the logic to interpret the command lines.
