The current implementation expects commands to be in upper case, which is not compliant with the QDP standard's case insensitivity. From the search results, the key function to address this issue is `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, which processes the QDP file lines and identifies commands. The critical part of this function is where it processes and interprets these command lines. To resolve the issue, the function should be adjusted to handle case insensitivity for command lines. Additionally, the `_read_table_qdp` function is relevant as it calls `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and is directly involved in reading the QDP table. Since the case sensitivity issue resides in command processing, focusing on these functions will be essential to ensure the implementation can handle commands in any case.",
