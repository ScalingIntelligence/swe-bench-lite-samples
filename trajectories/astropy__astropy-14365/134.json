The functions `_get_lines_from_file`, `_interpret_err_lines`, `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, and `_read_table_qdp` are pivotal in this process. Specifically, the issue could lie in how commands are being processed in `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`. Upon analysis, it seems that the commands are being handled as case-sensitive (`command[1].lower()` is used, but I suspect validation might still expect uppercase). The function `_interpret_err_lines` does not seem directly involved in this issue since it primarily handles column interpretation based on parsed commands.

This causes an error when trying to read a QDP file with lower-case commands, such as 'read serr 1 2'. The relevant code spans primarily involve the parsing and interpretation of QDP commands and lines in the file. Specifically, the function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` processes lines and interprets commands. The command parsing part needs to be adjusted to ensure it correctly handles both upper and lower case commands, which will likely involve modifying the current line splitting and dictionary key assignment logic in the command parsing section.",
