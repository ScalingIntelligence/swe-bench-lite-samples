This leads to a crash when trying to read a QDP file with lowercase commands, as demonstrated in the 'How to Reproduce' section. I first analyzed the astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py file which contains the QDP-specific functionalities. The relevant code spans include '_read_table_qdp' which reads the QDP files, 'QDP' which is the class handling QDP file operations, 'QDP.__init__' for initialization, and 'QDP.read' for reading QDP files. These spans are directly involved in reading QDP files and will need modifications to handle case-insensitive commands. The 'Basic' class and its derivatives in the astropy/io/ascii/basic.py file are likely used for general ASCII file operations and not specifically tied to the QDP case sensitivity issue, so no changes are needed there. Therefore, the identified spans are where the relevant code logic resides that must be adapted to handle case-insensitive QDP commands.",
