The current implementation assumes that commands in a QDP file are in upper case, which contradicts the actual case insensitivity of QDP. This leads to errors when reading files with lowercase commands. The code spans provided include functions and methods responsible for reading and interpreting QDP files, specifically handling commands and error specifications. These are likely candidates for modification to address the case sensitivity issue. Notably, the `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and `_interpret_err_lines` functions deal with parsing and interpreting error commands, which are central to the issue. Additionally, the `QDP` class and its `read` method are also relevant as they are the entry points for reading QDP files. Therefore, these code spans are identified as relevant to solving the reported issue.",

The current implementation expects commands to be in upper case, which causes errors when reading files with lower-case commands. The expected behavior is for the reader to handle case-insensitive commands. The relevant code spans provided in the context and search results show the functions responsible for reading and interpreting QDP files, specifically handling the commands and interpreting error specifications. The key functions are `_get_lines_from_file`, `_interpret_err_lines`, `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, and `_read_table_qdp`. These functions parse the QDP file, interpret command lines, handle error specifications, and generate tables. The specific sections of code that need attention are where commands are parsed and interpreted, particularly in the `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and `_interpret_err_lines` functions. These sections currently handle commands in a case-sensitive manner, which is identified as the root cause of the issue.
