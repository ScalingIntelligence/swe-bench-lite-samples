The current implementation in `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` explicitly checks for commands in uppercase. However, the QDP format itself is not case-sensitive. Therefore, modifying the command parsing logic to handle case-insensitive commands would resolve the issue. Potential modifications could involve converting the command lines to lowercase for uniform comparison or normalizing the input before processing. The most relevant code spans are those that process the command lines and error specifications, as they directly relate to the case sensitivity issue. The `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function is the primary focus, and within it, the handling of command lines should be adjusted to be case-insensitive, likely in the section where commands are processed and error specifications are defined.",
