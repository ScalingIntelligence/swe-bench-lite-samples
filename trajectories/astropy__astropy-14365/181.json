The main functions to focus on are those related to reading and interpreting QDP files. Starting with '_get_lines_from_file', this function reads the lines from a QDP file, which is the initial step in parsing the file. The '_interpret_err_lines' function processes error specifications in the QDP file. The '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' function processes the entire QDP file and organizes its contents into tables, and '_read_table_qdp' is the main function for reading a QDP table. These functions are likely to handle the QDP commands which are currently assumed to be in upper case. Therefore, they need to be adjusted to accommodate case insensitive QDP commands. The other spans related to the QDP class and its header and data classes are also relevant as they define how the QDP format is handled, but less directly related to the case sensitivity issue.",
