The current implementation assumes that commands must be in upper case, which is not the case with QDP files generally. The relevant code spans to address this issue are likely in the `_read_table_qdp` function and the `QDP` class, specifically where the commands are parsed and interpreted. The `_read_table_qdp` function is responsible for reading the QDP file and extracting tables, and within this function is where commands like 'READ SERR 1 2' are expected and processed. Additionally, the `QDP.read` method calls `_read_table_qdp`, suggesting that modifications here could affect how the commands are treated. Therefore, it would be valuable to ensure that these commands are case-insensitive in the `_read_table_qdp` function.",
