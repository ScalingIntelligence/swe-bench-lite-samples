The relevant sections of code that handle the reading and interpretation of QDP files include '_read_table_qdp', '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', '_get_lines_from_file', and '_interpret_err_lines'. These functions are responsible for parsing the QDP file, interpreting the commands, and constructing the table. The current implementation assumes uppercase commands, as seen in the '_interpret_err_lines' function where the command keys are accessed via 'command[1].lower()'. This indicates a direct point of intervention to address the case sensitivity issue. By modifying the handling of commands to be case-insensitive, the QDP reader could accept commands in any case, aligning with the expected behavior described in the issue. Additionally, the '_get_lines_from_file' function is critical for reading the file contents, which are then processed by the other functions. Identifying and modifying these spans of code should resolve the issue without disrupting the overall functionality of the QDP reader.",
