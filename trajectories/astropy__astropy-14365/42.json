The current implementation assumes that QDP commands are upper case, which is not a requirement in the QDP specification. The focus should be on identifying code spans that handle reading and parsing QDP files, especially those involved in handling command lines. The provided search results include multiple spans that likely handle parsing and reading of QDP files, such as '_read_table_qdp', '_write_table_qdp', 'QDPHeader', 'QDPData', and 'QDP'. These spans cover the reading and writing of QDP files, including handling of error specifications (like SERR and TERR commands) and general table data. Therefore, these spans are relevant to the reported issue as they contain the code responsible for ensuring QDP files are correctly interpreted and loaded into a `Table` structure in astropy. Focusing on these spans will help identify where the case sensitivity assumption is made and where improvements are needed to handle non-uppercase commands.",
