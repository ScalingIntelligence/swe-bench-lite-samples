There is a requirement to handle QDP commands in a case-insensitive manner, as currently the system expects upper-case commands which does not align with the actual QDP file format behavior. The primary focus should be on the astropy.io.ascii.qdp module where the QDP file reading and writing functionalities are implemented. Additionally, the astropy.io.ascii.ui module should be checked where the 'read' function is defined and possibly used for reading QDP files, as well as the core functionalities in astropy.io.ascii.core which provide base classes for reader and writer operations.",

To address the case-insensitivity of QDP commands, modifications are needed in how commands are interpreted in the `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` function. This could involve converting command strings to a uniform case (either upper or lower) before processing. Additionally, the `QDPHeader` class, which is responsible for handling header-related operations, may also need similar adjustments since it processes command lines as well.",
