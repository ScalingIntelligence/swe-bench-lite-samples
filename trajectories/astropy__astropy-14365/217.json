Modifying these functions to normalize command strings to a consistent case (either upper or lower) before parsing should resolve this issue. This change should be made at the point where command lines are interpreted in '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', specifically at the point where 'command_lines' are processed. To implement this, a simple to_upper() or to_lower() conversion could be applied to 'cline' before its further processing.",
