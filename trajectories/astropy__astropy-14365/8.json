Specifically, the ''_get_tables_from_qdp_file'' function is responsible for processing the lines from a QDP file and interpreting commands, data, and comments. The ''_read_table_qdp'' function is used to read a table from a QDP file, invoking the ''_get_tables_from_qdp_file'' function. Additionally, the ''_write_table_qdp'' function is involved in writing tables back to QDP format, which could be relevant for testing changes made to the reader.
