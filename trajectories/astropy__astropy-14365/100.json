The current implementation in `astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py` seems to enforce this by immediately raising a `ValueError` for unrecognized lines, which would include non-uppercase commands. To address this, we need to modify the method used for reading QDP tables, likely `_read_table_qdp`, to be case-insensitive. This involves recognizing commands regardless of their case, which aligns with the QDP standard's case insensitivity. The relevant code spans identified focus on the methods and classes handling the reading and initialization of QDP files, specifically `_read_table_qdp`, `QDP`, and `QDP.read`.

Currently, the reader expects commands to be in uppercase, which is not consistent with the case-insensitivity of QDP itself. This leads to a `ValueError` when attempting to read a QDP file with lowercase commands. The goal is to allow the reader to interpret commands such as 'read serr 1 2' and 'read terr 1 2' regardless of their case. \n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans, the critical functions to address this issue are `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` and `_read_table_qdp`. The function `_get_tables_from_qdp_file` processes the QDP file line by line and identifies commands, data, and comments. However, it currently processes commands by splitting and directly using the command strings without considering case insensitivity. The modification needed here is to make the command parsing case-insensitive, likely by converting the command strings to lowercase before processing. \n\nAdditionally, the function `_write_table_qdp`, which writes a QDP file, should also be reviewed to ensure consistency in handling command case. Although the immediate issue is with reading, considering both reading and writing functions together ensures that the QDP format handling remains uniform and robust. \n\nThe identified relevant code spans include `_get_tables_from_qdp_file`, `_read_table_qdp`, and partially `_write_table_qdp` for context and future consistency checks.
