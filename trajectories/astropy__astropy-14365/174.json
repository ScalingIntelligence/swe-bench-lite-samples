The current implementation assumes all commands are upper case, which leads to a ValueError when encountering lowercase commands. To address this, the relevant code spans must handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. The identified functions '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and '_read_table_qdp' process the QDP file and interpret commands. A possible solution involves modifying the command interpretation process to either convert commands to a standard case (e.g., lowercase) or compare them in a case-insensitive manner. This could be achieved by adjusting how commands are parsed and stored in the 'err_specs' dictionary within '_get_tables_from_qdp_file'. Additionally, the '_read_table_qdp' function uses '_get_tables_from_qdp_file', making any changes in the latter directly affect the reading process. The 'QDP' class and its 'read' method also interact with the file input, though they don't directly process commands, so they will indirectly be impacted by changes in the reading functions. The aim is to ensure all parts of the process that handle QDP commands respect their case insensitivity, allowing the system to correctly interpret and process files regardless of command case.",
