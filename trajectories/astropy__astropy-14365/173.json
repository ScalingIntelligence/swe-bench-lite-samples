The current implementation assumes that commands are in upper case, which contradicts the actual case insensitivity of QDP files. To resolve this issue, changes need to be made in the code where QDP commands are processed. The relevant code spans are found in the '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and '_read_table_qdp' functions. Specifically, the logic within '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' that processes command lines and interprets error specifications may need adjustments to handle commands in a case-insensitive manner. This includes checking and processing commands regardless of their case, such as 'read serr 1 2' instead of only 'READ SERR 1 2'. The '_read_table_qdp' function interacts directly with '_get_tables_from_qdp_file' and should be reviewed for any necessary changes or improvements needed to facilitate the handling of case-insensitive commands.",
