The provided `lambdify` function in the `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` file is the central piece handling the lambdification process. The function initializes modules, namespaces, and printers, then compiles and executes the generated lambda function. The `dummify` parameter influences the handling of symbolic entities during this process. The `_EvaluatorPrinter` class, which extends behaviour for non-TensorFlow modules, is also relevant as it processes the printing of symbolic entities. Additional classes like `_TensorflowEvaluatorPrinter` adapt this behaviour for the TensorFlow module. Section coverage of code involved in configuring namespaces, managing imports, and utilizing specific printers (`NumExprPrinter` in `sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py`) assists in addressing the reported problem of `lambdify` not operating well with symbols having curly braces in their names. A deeper understanding of these sections' configuration would be insightful to resolve such compatibility issues concerning symbol names.",

The `lambdify` function in `lambdify.py` is responsible for converting symbolic expressions into lambda functions, but evidently, it faces challenges when these symbols involve curly braces, even when the `dummify` parameter is set to `True`. This suggests a deeper inspection is needed in how `_EvaluatorPrinter` and `_TensorflowEvaluatorPrinter` handle such symbols and whether any special treatment is necessary for symbols containing curly braces, especially within the `doprint` method. Additionally, analysis of `NumExprPrinter` in `lambdarepr.py` is crucial as it might be involved in translating expressions into forms that `lambdify` can work with, potentially influencing how `MatrixSymbol` with curly braces is rendered and processed.
