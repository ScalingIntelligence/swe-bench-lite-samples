The issue provided code examples demonstrating that `lambdify` works with scalar symbols containing curly braces and with `MatrixSymbol`s, but encounters a `SyntaxError` when both are combined. Given this, the focus should be on the `lambdify` function definition and its handling of `MatrixSymbol` inputs, especially when dummifying. Upon examining the search results, I found two key sections: the `MatrixSymbol` class definition in `matexpr.py` and the `lambdify` function definition in `lambdify.py`. The `MatrixSymbol` class is relevant as it defines the type of symbol that the issue specifically refers to. However, the primary focus should be on the `lambdify` function in `lambdify.py`, where the logic for handling input symbols and dummifying them is defined. Given the context and the detailed behavior described in the issue, the relevant code spans are those defining the `lambdify` function and its dummification process.",
