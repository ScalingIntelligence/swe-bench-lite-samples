Specifically, it points out that the `id_for_label` method in the MultiWidget class generates an id like f'{id_}0', which is not meaningful and can be removed. The issue also compares this with the ChoiceWidget class, where `add_id_index` allows more control over the label_id. The analysis of the search results shows that the `id_for_label` method in MultiWidget indeed appends '_0' to the id, which aligns with the issue description. The relevant code spans to address the issue are those related to the `id_for_label` method in both MultiWidget and ChoiceWidget, as understanding ChoiceWidget's handling of id_for_label helps in making a decision about how to handle it in MultiWidget.",

The file context does not suggest the direct removal or modification of the `id_for_label` method in the `MultiWidget` class. However, it provides the context that suggests the method's implementation and the specific issue with it, making it suitable for modification or removal as per the issue's suggestion.
