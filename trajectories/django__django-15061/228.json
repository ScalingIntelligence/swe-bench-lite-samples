The issue also compares this behavior to the ChoiceWidget, which allows more control over the label_id.\n\nIn the initial search results, two main files are relevant: 'django/forms/widgets.py' and 'django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py'. The 'MultiWidget' class in 'widgets.py' is the primary focus as it directly relates to the issue. It contains the 'id_for_label' method which currently appends '_0' to the id if it exists. This method needs to be removed or modified to not append the index.\n\nAdditionally, the 'SplitArrayWidget' in 'array.py' also has an 'id_for_label' method with a similar behavior, which could potentially be relevant depending on how this widget is used in relation to MultiWidget and the reported issue. The other files, such as 'django/contrib/admin/widgets.py' and 'django/contrib/auth/forms.py', do not directly relate to the issue at hand, although it is worth noting they have their own 'id_for_label' methods, which might benefit from similar changes in future enhancements.\n\nIt is crucial to identify all occurrences of 'id_for_label' that might affect the label generation in the context of the MultiWidget and its derivatives to ensure that the change does not negatively impact other areas of the codebase.",
