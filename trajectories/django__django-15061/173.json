The goal is to possibly remove the `id_for_label` method from the `MultiWidget` class to address this issue.

Among these spans, the 'MultiWidget.id_for_label' span directly addresses the issue by including the method in question. This span is relevant for the proposed change of removing the method. The 'MultiWidget.__init__' span might also be relevant when considering any necessary modifications to the initialization process, but since the issue specifically targets the 'id_for_label' method, it's less directly relevant.
