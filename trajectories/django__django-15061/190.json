            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the `MultiWidget` class in Django's forms widgets, specifically targeting the removal of the `id_for_label` method. This method is used to generate the id for labels associated with widgets. However, the issue's description implies that the current implementation of `id_for_label` in `MultiWidget` is problematic because it generates ids like `{id_}0`, which doesn't make sense as per the user. The user suggests either removing this method entirely or giving more control over it, similar to how the `ChoiceWidget` class handles its `add_id_index` attribute. Currently, the `id_for_label` method is defined in the parent `Widget` class, not directly in `MultiWidget`. This method returns the id passed to it directly, implying that any subclass would need to override this method if specific id generation logic is required. Given this, the search results contain the definition of the `id_for_label` method in the `Widget` class. It appears relevant to the reported issue as it directly affects how ids are generated for labels in widgets, and understanding this method is crucial for addressing the issue either by modifying or removing it in the context of `MultiWidget`. The relevant code spans would include the `MultiWidget` class for context and the `Widget` class where `id_for_label` is defined, specifically focusing on the method itself to understand its current implementation and implications for its modification or removal.",
