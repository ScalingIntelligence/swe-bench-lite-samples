The analysis of the search results reveals that the MultiWidget class, which inherits from the Widget class, indeed has the 'id_for_label' method. This method is responsible for appending '_0' to the id_ parameter, which aligns with the issue description. Additionally, another class called SplitDateTimeWidget inherits from MultiWidget, which suggests that removing the method from MultiWidget could affect SplitDateTimeWidget as well. The RelatedFieldWidgetWrapper class also has an 'id_for_label' method, but it delegates the call to its widget, which might not be directly affected by the change in MultiWidget.\n\nGiven the context, specifically identifying the 'MultiWidget' class and its 'id_for_label' method is crucial as the reported issue is directly concerned with this class and method. Other classes, like SplitDateTimeWidget, might be indirectly affected by this change, and further considerations might be needed to ensure that removing the method does not introduce unintended side effects.",
