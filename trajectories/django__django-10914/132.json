The problem is that the default permissions for files uploaded via MemoryUploadedFile or TemporaryUploadedFile might not be consistent. This can lead to files with permissions set to 0o0600, which is less restrictive than often desired. The FileSystemStorage class is responsible for saving files to the file system. The issue likely involves understanding and modifying the _save method in FileSystemStorage to ensure that it sets a default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION if none is provided. Additionally, the global_settings.py file might need to be updated to include a default for FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS. The search should focus on these areas to ensure that the file permissions for uploaded files are consistent and configurable.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is concerned with setting the default file permissions for uploaded files in Django. Specifically, it suggests that the current documentation lacks a warning about permission inconsistencies related to the use of MemoryUploadedFile and TemporaryUploadedFile. This issue could arise due to the use of tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile, which sets file permissions to 0o0600 by default on some systems like CentOS. The task is to find relevant code spans that deal with file upload permissions and the FileSystemStorage class.\n\nIn the provided search results, several code spans from the `global_settings.py` file were analyzed. The span with ID 'impl:105' contains the variable `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` which is set to None. This suggests that there is no default setting for file permissions upon upload, which aligns with the issue reported. Also checked the `storage.py` file containing the `FileSystemStorage` class implementation, looking for any hardcoded permissions. Did not find any hardcoded permissions, but found methods like `file_permissions_mode` and `directory_permissions_mode` which suggest the storage class adjusts permissions dynamically.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans in `global_settings.py` and `storage.py` are relevant to the issue. The lack of a default for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` indicates a potential point where the default could be set to 0o644 as suggested in the issue. The methods in `FileSystemStorage` do not explicitly set permissions, hinting at necessary adjustments to align with the issue's requirements.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
