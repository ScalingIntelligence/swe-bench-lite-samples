This is the key setting that needs to be adjusted to set default permissions. Next, in 'django/core/files/storage.py', the FileSystemStorage class is examined. There is a cached property 'file_permissions_mode' (FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode) that uses the setting 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' from the global settings. This property is used when saving files to determine the file permissions. However, the actual modification of the file permissions (os.chmod) happens within the '_save' method of the FileSystemStorage class, indicating that if 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' is set, this value will be applied to files upon their creation. Lastly, context around file upload handling is provided in 'django/core/files/uploadhandler.py', but these sections directly related to permissions are less critical. Overall, the relevant spans cover the settings for file upload permissions and their application in performing file saving operations.",

  "initial_message": "Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
