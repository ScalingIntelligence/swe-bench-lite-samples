The goal is to ensure that by default, file upload permissions are set to 0o644, and to identify and potentially update or add documentation or code to handle these permission contexts.",

This involves identifying where the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting is defined and how it is used in file storage operations. The search results provide several relevant code spans. In 'django/conf/global_settings.py', 'impl:105' contains the definition of FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting, which is currently set to None. This is the primary target for setting the default value. In 'django/core/files/storage.py', 'FileSystemStorage._save' contains the code that handles file saving, indicating where the permissions might be applied if explicitly configured. This section is relevant as it shows where the permission settings might influence file operations. The 'FileField' class in 'django/forms/fields.py' is also identified as relevant because it involves file handling and could interact with the file permissions indirectly through the storage classes. However, it does not directly deal with setting permissions.

  "initial_message": "Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
