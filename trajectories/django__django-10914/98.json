This occurs due to the permissions set by Python's tempfile module when using NamedTemporaryFile, leading to 0o0600 permissions on some systems like CentOS 7.4.1708 with Python 3.6.5. To address this, we should focus on the FileSystemStorage class and its file_permissions_mode attribute, which sets the permissions for files on the filesystem. Additionally, we need to check how TemporaryUploadedFile and InMemoryUploadedFile handle file permissions during the upload process.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
