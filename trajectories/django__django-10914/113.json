The concern is that without explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for an uploaded file might not be consistent depending on whether the file is handled temporarily as a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile. This inconsistency arises from the use of tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile which, due to security considerations, sets permissions to 0o0600 on some systems, notably CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5. The search results contain relevant code spans that can be used to address this issue:\n\n1. **django/core/files/storage.py**: This file contains the definition of FileSystemStorage and its __init__ method, which initializes file_permissions_mode. This is directly related to setting the permissions for uploaded files.\n2. **django/core/files/uploadedfile.py**: This file contains the definitions of TemporaryUploadedFile and InMemoryUploadedFile, which are the file types that could lead to inconsistent permissions. Reviewing their __init__ methods will help understand how permissions are set initially.\n3. **django/core/files/uploadhandler.py**: This file contains the definitions of TemporaryFileUploadHandler and MemoryFileUploadHandler, which handle file uploads and could influence file permissions based on the type of handler used.\n4. **django/conf/global_settings.py**: This file contains default settings including FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, setting this to 0o644 would address the reported issue. However, this change should be considered in the context of other code to ensure it doesn't introduce new issues.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans can be used to implement a fix for the reported issue.

Specifically, the FileSystemStorage class in django/core/files/storage.py has parameters for setting file and directory permissions, which aligns with the issue's request. This suggests that the code that would need to be modified to set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS is identified. Additionally, the global_settings.py file contains the setting FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, which is currently set to None. This configuration points to where the default permissions could be set to 0o644. As no other relevant code to fix or implement this issue was found outside of what's provided in the context, I believe all relevant code has been identified.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
