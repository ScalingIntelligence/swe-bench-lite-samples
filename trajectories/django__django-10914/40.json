The search results reveal several relevant sections of code: \n\n1. In `django/conf/global_settings.py`, the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is set to `None`, implying no default permission is defined. This needs to be changed to `0o644`. \n\n2. The `FileSystemStorage` class in `django/core/files/storage.py` has properties related to file and directory permissions (`file_permissions_mode` and `directory_permissions_mode`), which might need to account for the new default permission setting if not already configured. \n\n3. The settings initialization and retrieval are handled in `django/conf/__init__.py`, specifically in the `Settings` class. Modifications might be necessary here to ensure the new default value for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is properly applied across the application. \n\nGiven these findings, the suggested default permission setting should be implemented in `django/conf/global_settings.py` and checked for its impact and correct application in `django/core/files/storage.py` and `django/conf/__init__.py`.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
