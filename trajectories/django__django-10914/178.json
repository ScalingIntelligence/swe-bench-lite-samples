            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about setting a default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644 to ensure consistent file permissions when uploading files using Django's FileSystemStorage. This is especially important when dealing with large files that exceed the memory threshold and are stored temporarily. The search results provided contain several relevant code spans. First, in django/conf/global_settings.py, we find the setting FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS which is currently set to None. This setting should likely be adjusted to 0o644. Second, in django/core/files/storage.py, we find the FileSystemStorage class, which is the default storage for uploaded files. It contains methods for saving files (_save), which is likely where permissions are applied, though these permissions are not explicitly set in the code spans provided. However, the __init__ method of FileSystemStorage initializes file_permissions_mode, which aligns with the issue's focus on permissions.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans from the search results are quite relevant to issue resolution. They provide both the default settings configuration (in global_settings.py) and the implementation details of the FileSystemStorage (in storage.py), particularly the portions related to permissions. These spans are likely the starting point for addressing the issue and implementing the necessary changes.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
