This could lead to inconsistent permissions depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or TemporaryUploadedFile was used. To address this, we need to look into the FileSystemStorage class and its handling of file permissions, specifically the `file_permissions_mode` and `directory_permissions_mode` properties. Additionally, reviewing the `_save` method in FileSystemStorage could be crucial as it handles the actual saving of files, potentially where permission settings are applied. We should also consider the global settings file to see if there's a default setting for FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION that needs adjustment.",

Additionally, the 'FileSystemStorage' class in 'django/core/files/storage.py' is examined to understand how file permissions are currently handled.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
