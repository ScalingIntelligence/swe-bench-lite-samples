The issue involves ensuring that file permissions are consistent regardless of the type of uploaded file (MemoryUploadedFile or TemporaryUploadedFile). I found relevant sections in 'django/conf/global_settings.py' where FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS is initially set to None, which indicates that it needs to be explicitly defined. Additionally, I looked into 'django/core/files/storage.py' to see how the permissions are handled during file saving, which is relevant for implementing the new default permission. The 'FileSystemStorage' class in this file includes methods for saving and deleting files, which may need adjustments to ensure the correct permissions are applied. However, there is no direct code span setting FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644, suggesting this needs to be added possibly in a settings file or configuration where default settings are overridden.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
