The analysis involves looking into where FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS are defined and how they are used during file uploads. From the search results, several relevant code spans were identified:\n\n1. In 'django/conf/global_settings.py', the 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' is set to 'None'. This is the default setting and appears to be the main configuration point for file upload permissions.\n\n2. In 'django/core/files/storage.py', the 'FileSystemStorage' class has properties 'file_permissions_mode' and 'directory_permissions_mode'. These properties are cached and used in the '_save' method, which is crucial for understanding how file permissions are applied during file storage.\n\n3. Also in 'django/core/files/storage.py', the '__init__' method of 'FileSystemStorage' accepts 'file_permissions_mode' and 'directory_permissions_mode' as parameters, which tie directly to the file handling and storage logic.\n\n4. In 'django/core/files/uploadedfile.py', the 'TemporaryUploadedFile' and 'InMemoryUploadedFile' classes are relevant because they handle file uploads differently based on file size, which could affect file permissions.\n\nCombining these findings, I've identified the key spans that should help address the reported issue.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
