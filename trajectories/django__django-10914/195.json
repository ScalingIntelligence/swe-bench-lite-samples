The issue mentions the default behavior of file uploads and the potential inconsistency in permissions based on the type of uploaded file (MemoryUploadedFile vs TemporaryUploadedFile). It also highlights a specific problem with the permissions being set to 0o0600 on some systems due to Python's built-in tempfile module. The search results provide several relevant code spans:\n1. In 'django/core/files/storage.py', we find the FileSystemStorage class with methods related to file and directory permissions.\n2. In 'django/core/files/uploadedfile.py', the TemporaryUploadedFile class is defined, which is crucial for understanding the temporary file handling during uploads.\n3. In 'django/conf/global_settings.py', the default settings for file upload permissions are defined.\n4. There are specific methods like '_value_or_setting', 'file_permissions_mode', and 'directory_permissions_mode' in 'django/core/files/storage.py' that determine the permissions modes.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they directly involve the file upload process and how permissions are set or influenced. The analysis of these spans indicates that the issue primarily concerns the FileSystemStorage class, the TemporaryUploadedFile class, and the global settings for FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS. Consequently, these spans should be marked as identified for further action related to setting default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.",

This indicates that the permissions are indeed settable through settings, aligning with the request to set a default permissions mode of 0o644. Additionally, the documentation issue regarding warnings about inconsistencies in permissions based on the type of uploaded file can also be addressed, considering the code in django/core/files/uploadedfile.py that deals with temporary uploaded files. The global settings file django/conf/global_settings.py also contains the setting for FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, which could be adjusted. I believe all relevant parts of the code have been identified.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
