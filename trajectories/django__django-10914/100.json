The analysis of the provided code spans reveals several relevant sections:\n\n1. Within `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py`, the `TemporaryUploadedFile` class involves the creation of temporary files using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`. This process can affect file permissions as described in the issue.\n\n2. In `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py`, the `TemporaryFileUploadHandler` class interacts with `TemporaryUploadedFile`, indicating a direct link to file upload handling.\n\n3. The `django/core/files/storage.py` file contains the `FileSystemStorage` class, which is responsible for saving files to the file system. It includes methods and properties that deal with file and directory permissions, notably `file_permissions_mode` and `directory_permissions_mode`. These are central to ensuring the desired file permissions are applied during file storage.\n\n4. The `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting in `django/conf/global_settings.py` is crucial, as it defines the default file upload permissions. This setting influences how uploaded files are treated, and its default value (`None`) should be corrected to `0o644` to address the issue.\n\nThus, the relevant code spans from these files identified directly affect the handling and permissions of file uploads, closely matching the requirements of the reported issue.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
