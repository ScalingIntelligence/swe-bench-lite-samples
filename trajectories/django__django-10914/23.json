To address this, I need to identify the relevant sections of code that deal with file upload permissions. The search results provided include components related to file storage and upload handling, which are directly relevant to the issue at hand. The 'FileSystemStorage' class in 'django/core/files/storage.py' contains methods and properties that manage file permissions and storage details. Key spans in this class, such as 'file_permissions_mode', 'directory_permissions_mode', and the '_save' method which handles file saving and directory creation, are directly related to the permissions issue. Additionally, 'django/conf/global_settings.py' includes the default settings for file upload permissions, highlighting 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS'. Together, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of how file upload permissions are handled and configured in Django. These selections should inform the necessary changes to set a default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION of 0o644 to prevent inconsistent file permissions due to different types of uploaded files.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
