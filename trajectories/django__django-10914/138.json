The code analysis focused on identifying parts of the code that deal with file permissions and file uploads. Two main classes were examined: FileSystemStorage and TemporaryUploadedFile. In FileSystemStorage, the code spans covering initialization, property handling, and file saving operations were relevant because they might affect file permissions. Specifically, the methods __init__, _clear_cached_properties, and _save were noted for potential impact on file permissions during file upload operations. Additionally, the TemporaryUploadedFile class was reviewed for how it handles temporary files, focusing on the __init__ and temporary_file_path methods which directly involve creating and accessing temporary files. Though not directly setting permissions, understanding how these temporary files are handled provides context for potential permission discrepancies. The global settings in django/conf/global_settings.py were also relevant as they define default settings including FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, which is explicitly mentioned in the issue. Examining these parts of the codebase is essential for understanding and potentially addressing the issue of inconsistent file permissions.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
