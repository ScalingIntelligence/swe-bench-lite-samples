The settings file includes default values for various configurations including FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS and FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS, both of which are set to None. The code structure suggests that these settings might affect file permissions for uploads. However, more context may be needed to fully understand how these settings influence the actual permissions when files are uploaded. It's also not clear from the file context how or where these default None values of permissions settings are overridden.

In this class, the method _save is particularly relevant as it handles the saving of files to the filesystem and includes the setting of file permissions. The method uses the file_permissions_mode attribute, which is determined by the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
