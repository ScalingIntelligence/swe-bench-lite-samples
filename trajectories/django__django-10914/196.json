The problem arises due to differences in file permissions when using MemoryUploadedFile versus TemporaryUploadedFile, which can lead to files being created with restrictive permissions like 0o0600. Relevant files are those dealing with file storage, upload handling, and file fields. Looking into the FileSystemStorage class and its related methods, especially those dealing with file permissions and saving files, would be crucial to address this issue.",

The search results provide relevant code spans in the `FileSystemStorage` class within `django/core/files/storage.py`, which handles file permissions during file uploads. Specifically, the `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` method checks for the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting and applies it to files being saved.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
