This discrepancy is caused by the default temporary file handling in Django, which results in file permissions being set to 0o0600 on some systems. The solution involves setting a default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS in configuration files and ensuring that this is properly documented to warn users about potential permission inconsistencies. To address this, I will focus my search on configuration files and the file storage classes in Django to find where file permissions are set and documented.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
