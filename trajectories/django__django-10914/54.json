The primary concern is that the default permissions might vary depending on whether a file is stored in memory or temporarily on disk. This inconsistency arises from how Python's tempfile module handles permissions for temporary files. To address this, we need to find where FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS can be set and how it impacts the FileSystemStorage class and related file handling methods. We should look for instances where file permissions are either explicitly set or implicitly decided based on the upload method.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
