This is the key setting that needs to be adjusted to ensure the desired default permissions. The user's request is to set this to 0o644 if not explicitly configured. There are no other specific code spans that directly address file upload permissions; however, the FileSystemStorage class in django/core/files/storage.py is relevant as it handles file storage and could potentially influence file permissions during upload.

In `django/core/files/storage.py`, the `FileSystemStorage` class is pertinent as it handles file permissions during the saving process. The `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` property uses the `settings.FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to determine the file permissions. Furthermore, the `FileSystemStorage._save` method is critical as it ensures the correct permissions are set when a file is saved. In `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py`, the `TemporaryFileUploadHandler` and `MemoryFileUploadHandler` classes manage how files are uploaded based on their size and are, therefore, relevant to the issue. The current context provides a comprehensive understanding of the relevant code spans. Key spans include those handling the file permissions during storage (`FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode` and `FileSystemStorage._save`), and the handlers related to how files are actually uploaded (`TemporaryFileUploadHandler` and `MemoryFileUploadHandler`).

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
