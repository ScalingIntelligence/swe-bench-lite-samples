This discrepancy arises due to the use of tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile with its default permissions of 0o0600, which can lead to inconsistent permissions for files uploaded to FileSystemStorage. To address this, it's essential to identify the sections of code responsible for handling file uploads and setting file permissions, particularly in the FileSystemStorage class and the upload handlers. Additionally, the default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting in global_settings.py should be checked.",

The focus is on understanding how file permissions are handled during file uploads, particularly in the FileSystemStorage class and the global settings related to file uploads.\n\n1. **Importance of FileSystemStorage class**: The FileSystemStorage class in 'django/core/files/storage.py' is critical as it encapsulates the logic for saving files to a local filesystem, which is directly related to the reported issue about file permissions.\n\n2. **Global Settings Relevance**: The global settings in 'django/conf/global_settings.py' provide default configurations for various aspects of Django, including file uploads. The setting FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS is particularly important here as it dictates the default permissions for uploaded files. Its default value is 'None', meaning the system's default permissions (often influenced by the system's umask) are used.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: Understanding where and how FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS is used within FileSystemStorage is crucial. The '_save' method in FileSystemStorage (span 'FileSystemStorage._save') is where file saving operations occur, and permissions for directories are set based on the settings.\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant code spans are those modifying or using FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, which includes the FileSystemStorage class's method for saving files and the global setting itself in 'django/conf/global_settings.py'.\n\nAdditionally, the TemporaryUploadedFile class in 'django/core/files/uploadedfile.py' indicates how temporary files are managed, which could indirectly influence final file permissions if not properly handled during the transition from temporary to permanent storage.\n\nThe LazySettings class in 'django/conf/__init__.py' is relevant because it lazily loads settings, potentially including FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, ensuring configuration consistency across the Django environment.\n\nThe analysis indicates that understanding the integration of FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS between settings, storage classes, and file handling processes is key to addressing the reported issue effectively.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
