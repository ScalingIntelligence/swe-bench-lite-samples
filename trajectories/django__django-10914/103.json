This inconsistency can be problematic, especially when dealing with security and file access controls. To address this, it is crucial to identify the code sections where the file permissions are set or influenced during the file upload process. Given the detailed context provided, focusing on the FileSystemStorage class, specifically its properties related to file and directory permissions, and methods handling file saving and deletion, is essential. Additionally, checking the default settings for file upload permissions and the handlers involved in the file upload process (TemporaryFileUploadHandler and MemoryFileUploadHandler) will provide a comprehensive understanding of how to set or modify the default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS.",

The issue notes that the default permissions might be 0o0600 on some systems due to the Python's tempfile module security considerations. To address this, we need to examine the settings and methods involved in file uploads and storage.\n\n1. **Settings Analysis**: The search results show relevant settings in `django/conf/global_settings.py`, including `FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS`, `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, and `FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`. These settings are crucial for understanding the default behaviors and potential modifications needed.\n\n2. **FileSystemStorage Class**: In `django/core/files/storage.py`, the `FileSystemStorage` class is significant as it handles the saving and deletion of files. The `_save` method is particularly relevant, as it deals with creating directories and files with specified permissions. The `file_permissions_mode` parameter in the `__init__` method of `FileSystemStorage` is also critical for setting file permissions.\n\n3. **Upload Handlers**: The `TemporaryFileUploadHandler` and `MemoryFileUploadHandler` in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` are invoked based on the size of the uploaded data. These handlers manage how data is stored temporarily before being moved to the final storage location.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans are directly related to the reported issues, providing the necessary context and code spans to address the concerns about default file permissions and upload handling in Django.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
