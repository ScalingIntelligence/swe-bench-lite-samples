The analysis of the provided code spans reveals relevant sections in `django/core/files/storage.py`, which includes the `FileSystemStorage` class and its `_save` method. This method is responsible for saving the uploaded file to the filesystem and setting permissions for the directory. Additionally, the `django/conf/global_settings.py` file contains default settings, including `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, which is exactly what needs to be configured or documented to provide a default value. The `django/core/files/uploadedfile.py` file handles different types of uploaded files, such as `TemporaryUploadedFile` and `InMemoryUploadedFile`, which are crucial for understanding the context of file uploads and permissions. Finally, `django/conf/__init__.py` is relevant because it initializes the Django settings and their overrides. These code spans together provide a comprehensive view of the upload process and settings configuration, which is essential for implementing or documenting the setting of file permissions as requested by the user.",

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
