This involves ensuring that when files are uploaded to the FileSystemStorage, the permissions are consistently 0o644 in the absence of explicit configuration. Key areas to explore in the codebase are configurations related to file uploads, especially the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting and how file uploads are handled via `MemoryFileUploadHandler` and `TemporaryFileUploadHandler`. From the search results, the `django/conf/global_settings.py` file contains relevant spans (`impl:105`, `impl:79`) which define the default `FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS` and `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. Additionally, the `TemporaryFileUploadHandler` class and its interactions in `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py` are pertinent, as temporary file handling directly affects file permissions post-upload. Furthermore, the `FileSystemStorage` class in `django/core/files/storage.py` is crucial as it deals with saving and managing file permissions, specifically the `_save` method which interacts with the file system. These sections of the codebase can be targeted to address the issue by implementing or adjusting the default permissions to 0o644.",

  "initial_message": "Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the \u200bFile Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
