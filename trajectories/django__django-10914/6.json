The problem arises specifically with the FileSystemStorage class, which might not consistently set permissions based on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or TemporaryUploadedFile was used. To address this, we should search for the global_settings.py file to see if FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION is already defined. We should also specifically search for implementations in the FileSystemStorage class in storage.py to check how file permissions are handled during the file saving process. Additionally, looking into the upload handler and uploadedfile modules is necessary to understand the context in which temporary files are handled and potentially how their permissions might be set.",

The issue highlights the need for a default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION setting to ensure consistent permissions. The analysis of the provided code spans revealed several relevant sections. First, in django/conf/global_settings.py, span 'impl:105' sets the default value for FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS to None, which indicates that permissions are not explicitly set by default. Second, in django/core/files/storage.py, span 'FileSystemStorage._save' shows the method responsible for saving files and handling directory permissions, which could potentially be adjusted to set file permissions upon save. Finally, in django/core/files/uploadhandler.py, there are definitions for TemporaryFileUploadHandler and MemoryFileUploadHandler, which might be crucial for understanding how different file types are handled during upload. The relevant code spans identified should be sufficient to address the issue by either setting a default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION or adjusting the file saving process to handle permissions explicitly. Based on this analysis, the following code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

Additionally, the FileSystemStorage class in storage.py does handle file permissions during the file saving process, which is central to the issue of consistency in file permissions. The upload handler classes in uploadhandler.py are also relevant as they determine whether a file is saved in memory or as a temporary file, which could affect permissions. However, while the framework for addressing the issue is present, there is no explicit default setting of 0o644 in FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS as requested in the issue.

In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n"
