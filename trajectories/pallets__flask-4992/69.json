This requires not just understanding the current behavior of the function but also the potential integration points within the Flask application, particularly how files are opened and used. From the search results, we see several relevant files: `src/flask/scaffold.py` and `src/flask/app.py`. In `src/flask/scaffold.py`, the `Scaffold.open_resource` method is relevant as it deals with opening files in different modes, and it could serve as a model for how `from_file` might handle modes. Additionally, the broader context in `Scaffold.__init__` and other setup methods provide insight into the application's structure. In `src/flask/app.py`, the `Flask.open_instance_resource` method also demonstrates handling file mode, suggesting a similar approach could be integrated for `Config.from_file`. These findings strongly suggest that the `Config.from_file` method could be updated by adding a mode parameter based on these existing method patterns. Further, this highlights the need for a close review of these sections to ensure all necessary changes are made for a seamless integration of TOML support in binary mode.",
