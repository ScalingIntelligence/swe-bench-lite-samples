This is necessary because the `tomllib.load()` function requires the file to be opened in binary mode. There is a need to identify and possibly modify the source code where `flask.Config.from_file()` is defined. The relevant file appears to be `src/flask/config.py`, which contains the `Config` class and its `from_file` method. Since this issue could also involve altering how file reading modes are handled in Flask, it might be beneficial to investigate other areas where file modes are specified or could be influenced, potentially in `src/flask/scaffold.py` or `src/flask/app.py`.",

This would allow the method to accept a mode argument to open files in binary mode when necessary, specifically for loading TOML config files using `tomllib.load()`. In the search results provided, the relevant code spans are found in `src/flask/scaffold.py` and `src/flask/app.py`. Key parts of the code include the `Scaffold` class and its methods such as `open_resource` and `open_instance_resource`, which already handle file opening with a mode parameter. These methods can serve as examples for how to implement a mode parameter in `flask.Config.from_file()`. They show how Flask already supports custom modes for opening files, making it possible to introduce a similar functionality within the `Config` class. This approach aligns with the enhancement suggested in the issue, promoting code consistency and functionality. Hence, the identified code spans are relevant and provide a basis for implementing the requested feature.",
