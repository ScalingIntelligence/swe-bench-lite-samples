By examining the provided code spans, I can see relevant methods in `Flask` class such as `open_instance_resource` and `run`, but these do not relate directly to `Config.from_file()`. In `Scaffold`, there's `open_resource` which initializes with a default mode 'rb'. This suggests that implementing a similar mode parameter in `Config.from_file` is consistent with Flask's existing practices for file handling. Finally, in `app.py`, there are multiple instances of Flask's internals being defined which might influence the scope of changes required to support this new parameter. The file paths and spans relevant to understanding the file handling and where changes could be implemented are `src/flask/app.py` for Flask class internals, `src/flask/scaffold.py` for the Scaffold class and its resource management, and `src/flask/config.py` (not provided) which would contain `Config.from_file()`.",

This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\r\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\r\n    app.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load, mode=\"b\")\r\n```\r\n\n"
