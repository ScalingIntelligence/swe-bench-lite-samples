This is because `tomllib.load()` requires a file opened in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` currently opens files in text mode. There are several files that might be relevant, particularly `config.py` where the `from_file` method is defined, as well as potentially related methods in other files like `scaffold.py`, `app.py`, and `json/__init__.py`. It would be beneficial to dig deeper into the specifics of the `from_file` method in `config.py` and any other methods that might load files.",

This would allow the method to handle files opened in binary mode, which is necessary for loading TOML config files using the `tomllib` package in Python 3.11. The current implementation of 'flask.Config.from_file()' only opens files in text mode, causing a TypeError when trying to load TOML files with 'tomllib.load()'.\n\nSearch Results Analysis:\n1. The relevant code is found in 'src/flask/config.py'. The 'Config' class contains the 'from_file' method, which is the focus of the issue.\n2. The 'from_file' method currently takes 'filename' and 'load' parameters, and opens the file in text mode. This is the part that needs modification to accept a 'mode' parameter.\n3. The 'Scaffold' class in 'src/flask/scaffold.py' and the 'Flask' class in 'src/flask/app.py' are also relevant as they interact with the 'Config' class and need to be checked for any potential impact on the new functionality.\n4. The 'Scaffold.open_resource' and 'Flask.open_instance_resource' methods both take a 'mode' parameter for opening files, which suggests a pattern that could guide the implementation for 'from_file'.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the identified spans are the 'from_file' method in 'Config' class and its interaction points within the 'Scaffold' and 'Flask' classes.",

Additionally, the `open_resource` and `open_instance_resource` methods in `src/flask/scaffold.py` and `src/flask/app.py`, respectively, both support a mode parameter, which suggests that the design of handling different file modes is already present elsewhere in the codebase.

  "initial_message": "Add a file mode parameter to flask.Config.from_file()\nPython 3.11 introduced native TOML support with the `tomllib` package. This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\r\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\r\n    app.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load, mode=\"b\")\r\n```\r\n\n"
