The current method opens the file in text mode, which is incompatible with loading from TOML files using `tomllib.load()`, which requires binary mode. The issue suggests adding a `mode` parameter to `from_file` that would default to text mode but allows for binary mode. The search results provided include the `Config` class with the `from_file` method. This method currently does not accept a mode parameter. The provided search results contain the relevant code span necessary to identify the method that needs modification. To implement the solution, we would modify the signature of `from_file` to include `mode: str = 'r'` and adjust the `open` call within the method to use this mode. However, since the original search results do not include this modification, we should focus on the identified span which specifies the current implementation of `from_file`, as this is the point where the binary/text mode difference becomes relevant.",

  "initial_message": "Add a file mode parameter to flask.Config.from_file()\nPython 3.11 introduced native TOML support with the `tomllib` package. This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\r\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\r\n    app.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load, mode=\"b\")\r\n```\r\n\n"
