The search results provide a detailed view of the `Scaffold` class, which includes various properties and methods that are likely related to file handling and configuration loading within Flask. Notably, the `Scaffold.open_resource` method currently supports opening files in read modes including binary ('rb'). This suggests that a similar functionality could be extended to the `Config.from_file` method. To address the issue, we should focus on the `Scaffold` class, specifically its file handling capabilities and the `Config` class if available, to understand how we might add a mode parameter to the `from_file` method. The search results thus far do not directly include the `Config` class or the `from_file` method implementation, but they do provide context on file handling within the `Scaffold` class, which is likely related. Further search or examination of additional parts of the codebase might be necessary to complete the task, especially to find the actual implementation of the `Config` class and its methods.",
