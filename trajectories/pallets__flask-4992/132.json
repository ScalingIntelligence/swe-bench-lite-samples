The current implementation of `flask.Config.from_file()` is not directly found in the provided search results. However, we can infer the potential location of this method based on the context provided in the issue and the related functions and methods found in the search results. The main focus is on the `open_resource` and `open_instance_resource` methods in the `Scaffold` and `Flask` classes, respectively, as these methods handle file opening and could be related to the `from_file` method's functionality. These methods currently accept a `mode` parameter which defaults to 'rb', which is relevant to the issue as it addresses the requirement for binary mode. Therefore, these methods can serve as a reference or a basis for modifying or extending the `from_file` method to include a file mode parameter. This approach would align with the need to provide a mechanism to specify file modes directly in the method call, simplifying the usage for scenarios like loading TOML files with `tomllib.load()`, which requires binary mode.",
