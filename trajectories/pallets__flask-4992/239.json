This is crucial because TOML files need to be opened in binary mode when using `tomllib.load()`. Currently, the method opens files in text mode, which is inconsistent with the requirements of `tomllib.load()`. The relevant code spans to address this issue would be the method itself and perhaps other related methods in the Config class that might interact with file reading modes. Currently, the method involves a try-except block where the file is opened in text mode, which needs to be changed to handle binary mode as well. There are also other methods in the Config class, such as `from_pyfile()`, which already handle file modes, and perhaps these can serve as a reference for how to implement the desired functionality in `from_file()`. Therefore, we need to identify the existing method `from_file()` and possibly other related methods that deal with file modes and need modifications to support this new feature.",

This suggests that modifying `from_file` to include a mode parameter would align with existing practices in the framework.
