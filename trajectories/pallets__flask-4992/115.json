While direct hits on `from_file()` are missing, the existence of other load methods like `from_object()` and `from_mapping()` suggests that the `Config` class is intrinsically involved in handling configuration data, making it a plausible site for the `from_file()` method's home. Since the method implementation is not found yet, it's crucial to continue the search with heightened precision, considering also the possibility of divergent class structures or method naming conventions that might be employed within the codebase.

  "initial_message": "Add a file mode parameter to flask.Config.from_file()\nPython 3.11 introduced native TOML support with the `tomllib` package. This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\r\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\r\n    app.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load, mode=\"b\")\r\n```\r\n\n"
