The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `get_related_populators` function within Django's `query.py` module. Specifically, the error is due to the 'id' field not being found in the list. The user suggests a potential fix by altering the `opts` variable assignment to point to the concrete model's meta. The search results provide the relevant code for the `QuerySet` class, including its `select_related()` and `only()` methods, which are the primary methods involved in the query optimization that led to the crash. This code is relevant as it demonstrates how these methods are implemented in Django and could be a starting point for further debugging or implementing the suggested fix. While the search results do not directly include the snippet where the error occurs, the presence of these methods indicates that the issue may be within the query construction or execution part of the code.

The user suggests a potential fix by modifying the get_meta method in django/db/models/sql/query.py. Reviewing the provided search results, particularly the get_meta method in django/db/models/sql/query.py and the related sections in django/db/models/query.py, I identify the relevant code spans that need to be analyzed further for potential fixes or enhancements.\n\nThe key areas of interest from the search results are:\n1. The get_meta method in django/db/models/sql/query.py which currently directly accesses model._meta but might need to be adjusted as per the user's suggestion to access concrete_model.\n2. The QuerySet.select_related and QuerySet.only methods in django/db/models/query.py where the logic for these methods could have an impact on the proxy model handling.\n\nBy identifying these specific spans, I can aim to implement the suggested fix or further investigate if there are deeper issues within the Django ORM code related to proxy models and query optimization.",
