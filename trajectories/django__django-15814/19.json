            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a crash when using `QuerySet.only()` on proxy models after `select_related()`. The user provided a traceback indicating the error occurs in `django/db/models/query.py` at the line `rel_cls = RelatedPopulator(rel_klass_info, select, db)`. This suggests that the issue is likely related to how Django handles the combination of `select_related()` and `only()` methods, particularly when dealing with proxy models. The user also mentioned a workaround by replacing `opts = cur_model._meta` with `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`, which indicates that the problem might stem from incorrect metadata handling for proxy models.\n\nUpon reviewing the search results, several code spans appear relevant. In `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, the `names_to_path` function handles the parsing of field names into a query path, which is crucial for the `only()` method. Additionally, the `deferred_to_data` function is responsible for managing deferred loading, which ties into the optimization methods `select_related()` and `only()`. These functions contain logic that directly impacts how fields are queried and instantiated, making them highly relevant to the issue.\n\nIn `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet._fetch_all` method is involved in fetching all related objects, which is a critical step when using `select_related()`. This method's interaction with the `RelatedPopulator` class and handling of related populators could be where the error occurs, especially if the metadata for proxy models is not correctly integrated.\n\nLastly, in `django/db/models/options.py`, the `Options.setup_proxy` method initializes metadata for proxy models, which is essential since the error revolves around proxy models. Correctly setting up proxy models' metadata is fundamental to resolving the issue.\n\nOverall, these segments of the code are central to handling proxy models with Django's optimization methods, and modifications in these areas might help resolve the crash when combining `select_related()` and `only()` on proxy models.",

These methods deal directly with resolving fields and relationships during query optimization, which aligns with the reported issue about 'select_related()' and 'only()' methods failing on proxy models. However, while the context helps in grasping the underlying mechanisms, a direct reference to the exact line causing the error (as reported in the traceback) is not explicitly provided in the file context.

The traceback points to a key function, get_related_populators in django/db/models/query.py, where the RelatedPopulator is instantiated. This class likely constructs the list 'init_list' that is expected to contain the 'id' field. Additionally, the deferred_to_data method in django/db/models/sql/query.py is responsible for processing deferred fields, and names_to_path is used to resolve field names into actual field objects. Both methods are critical for understanding how the 'id' field might be omitted or incorrectly processed in the context of proxy models. The setup_proxy and _get_fields methods in django/db/models/options.py also play a role in defining and retrieving fields for proxy models, specifically how fields are inherited or overridden in proxy models. Thus, a close examination of how these methods handle fields and relations, especially for proxy models, is necessary to address the issue. Furthermore, the RelatedPopulator class and its construction of the 'init_list' should be scrutinized to ensure all necessary fields, including 'id', are properly included.",

Additionally, the `setup_proxy` method in django/db/models/options.py is relevant for how fields are managed in proxy models. The issue suggests a potential bug in the handling of field lists like `init_list` in `RelatedPopulator`, which is expected to include the 'id' field that isn't found. The provided code lacks specific exception handling or field validation that might improve this situation directly and doesn't show incomplete parts that would help solve the issue directly. Thus, while relevant to the issue, the code context isn't fully comprehensive to declare it complete.",
