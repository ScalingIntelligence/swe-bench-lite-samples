The search results include relevant sections from 'django/db/models/options.py' and 'django/db/models/base.py'. In 'django/db/models/options.py', the 'Options' class is relevant as it includes the 'setup_proxy' method, which initializes the metadata for proxy models, setting 'self.pk', 'self.proxy_for_model', and 'self.db_table' to the target model's metadata. This directly relates to the error, as the traceback suggests that the 'id' is not found in the list, which hints at issues with proxy model metadata handling. Additionally, the 'Model' class in 'django/db/models/base.py' is also relevant, particularly the '__init__' method, as it initializes the model instance and handles field assignment, which could be where the proxy model misconfiguration manifests into an error.

The `setup_proxy` method in the `Options` class demonstrates the metadata setup for proxy models, which is crucial for understanding the proxy model behavior. Additionally, the `get_fields` method within the same class is significant as it provides means to retrieve fields for models, which could be a potential source for the error related to the application's usage of `only()` method with proxy models. Furthermore, the `Model` class from `django/db/models/base.py` includes initialization logic that deals with setting up model instances, which is another likely area affected when issues arise from proxy model instantiation and usage with methods like `select_related` and `only`. Thus, the file context notably touches upon key areas of Django's model handling implicated in the reported issue. It hints at potential errors related to proxy model metadata handling and the initialization process of model instances involving fields, including their related functionalities. However, although these sections are pertinent to understanding and potentially resolving the issue, the direct link to the specific line number causing the error as suggested in the reported issue (i.e., changing 'opts = cur_model._meta' to 'opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta') is not explicitly found in the provided context.
