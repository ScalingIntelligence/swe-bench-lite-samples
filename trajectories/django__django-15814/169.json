The error occurs at the point where Django tries to retrieve related objects after applying these optimizations. From the provided traceback, the error occurs in the django/db/models/query.py file, specifically in the get_related_populators() method, where it tries to access the primary key ('id') which is not in the list. The user suggests a potential fix by changing how the model's options are accessed in the query.py file. The provided file_context and search_results suggest that there are methods in the QuerySet class (select_related and only) that directly relate to the issue. These methods are where the optimizations are applied for related fields and field subset loading, respectively. Thus, these methods and the overall QuerySet class are highly relevant to resolving the issue. Furthermore, the user's proposed fix relates to how model options (specifically, concrete model options) are accessed during query operations, which is related to the optimization strategies employed by select_related and only methods. Therefore, the analysis reveals that the identified code spans are indeed relevant to the reported issue, as they directly deal with the problematic methods and can help in diagnosing and possibly fixing the issue.",
