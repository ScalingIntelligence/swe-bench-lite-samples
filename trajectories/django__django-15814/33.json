The traceback and user-provided modifications suggest that there might be an issue with how the model's metadata (`_meta`) is accessed during the query optimization process. Given the context, the relevant parts of the codebase to investigate would be the methods responsible for handling `select_related()` and `only()` in Django's `QuerySet` class. The provided search results include the `QuerySet` class with its `select_related()` and `only()` methods, which are directly related to the reported issue. These methods are responsible for optimizing queries by selecting related objects and specifying which fields to load, respectively. The inclusion of these methods in the search results indicates that they are likely the source of the problem mentioned in the issue.

The provided stack trace and error message suggests that the issue arises due to the handling of the primary key (pk) in the context of proxy models. Specifically, the error 'ValueError: 'id' is not in list' suggests a problem in identifying or accessing the primary key when dealing with proxy models.\n\nThe current file context includes relevant sections from `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py`, particularly the `init`, `select_related`, and `only` methods. These methods are crucial for understanding how the query optimization is supposed to work.\n\nIn the new search results from the same file, there are additional relevant sections, such as the `ModelIterable` class and its `__iter__` method, which is where the query execution and object population occur. This is significant because the error might stem from how objects are instantiated and populated. There's also the `RelatedPopulator` class which could be responsible for the crash if it fails to properly handle proxy models.\n\nThe snippet provided in the issue (which suggests replacing `cur_model._meta` with `cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`) hints at the root of the problem: Django might be mistakenly using metadata from the proxy model instead of the concrete model. This adjustment seems to fix the issue, indicating that the fix involves properly distinguishing between the proxy and concrete models in the query processing.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans include the `RelatedPopulator` class and its `__init__` method which directly deals with populating related models and might need adjustments to properly handle proxy models. Additionally, the `ModelIterable` class and its `__iter__` method are crucial as they orchestrate the query execution and could benefit from checks or adjustments concerning proxy models.",

The traceback points to the RelatedPopulator initialization where the index of the primary key (pk_idx) is being set. Specifically, it mentions looking for 'id' in the init_list, which leads to the ValueError when 'id' is not found. This issue is directly related to how RelatedPopulator initializes its init_list and attempts to find the primary key index within it. Given the report that replacing cur_model._meta with cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta resolves the issue, it suggests that the model metadata used does not align with the expected fields for proxy models. Therefore, the relevant code spans should focus on the initialization and use of the init_list in RelatedPopulator and the handling of model metadata in the context of proxy models.",
