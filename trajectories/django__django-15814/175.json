The error suggests that there might be an issue with how the related fields are being processed when using these methods on proxy models. It's possible that the framework is not correctly identifying the concrete model for the proxy model during the query optimization process. We should focus our search on the `QuerySet` class and related classes in the Django ORM where `select_related()` and `only()` are implemented, as well as in the `Options` class where model metadata is managed, particularly the handling of proxy models. Additionally, the specific error 'id' is not in list might be related to field resolution in the query execution phase, so classes involved in query compilation and execution should also be investigated.",
