The error occurs specifically when the .only() method is used after .select_related() on the proxy model. The traceback points to the 'id' not being in the list, which suggests an issue with the model's primary key handling, possibly due to the proxy model's meta attributes not being correctly inherited or interpreted. The provided search results contain the relevant methods select_related() and only() in Django's QuerySet class definition. These methods are critical for understanding how the QuerySet processes related fields and immediate loading of fields respectively. By examining these methods, we can see how they handle and chain queries, which is crucial for diagnosing the issue reported. The issue also suggests that changing the metadata referencing to point to the concrete model's meta can resolve the issue, which implies a possible namespace or inheritance bug in handling proxy models. Therefore, the provided code spans for select_related() and only() are relevant to the reported issue as they define and control the behavior of these methods that directly relate to the problem context.",

The traceback and description suggest that the error occurs due to the incorrect handling of proxy models in the query processing, specifically in the `get_related_populators` function. The suggested solution involves modifying the `opts` variable to use the `concrete_model`'s meta information instead of the current model's meta information. The current context shows relevant code spans in `django/db/models/query.py` related to `QuerySet`, `select_related()`, and `only()`. The new search results include files related to proxy fields, related descriptors, and managers in Django, but none of them directly address the issue at hand or the suggested fix. Therefore, the current search results do not provide additional relevant code spans to address the issue reported.",

In the new search results, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the initialization of the model fields and the handling of related objects.

These methods provide insights into how Django processes the selected fields and initializes the related objects, which is crucial for addressing the reported issue.
