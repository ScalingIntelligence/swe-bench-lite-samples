The traceback and the information from models suggest that the problem lies in how the query is being processed and the related fields being fetched.

This issue occurs because the `only()` method does not correctly handle proxy models, leading to a `ValueError` when attempting to index the primary key. The suggested solution involves modifying the `query.py` file to use the concrete model's options instead of the proxy model's options. The search results provided contain several relevant spans in the `django/db/models/options.py` file, specifically focusing on the `Options` class and its methods related to proxy models and field handling. These spans include the `Options.__init__`, `Options.setup_proxy`, and `Options.get_fields` methods, which are directly relevant to the handling of proxy models and fields. Additionally, the `Options._populate_directed_relation_graph` method is relevant to the overall relationship handling in Django models.

The traceback indicates that the error occurs when initializing the primary key index in the RelatedPopulator class. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the proxy model's metadata is handled, particularly with respect to the primary key. The provided search results include the Options class from django/db/models/options.py, which is responsible for managing model metadata. The relevant sections include the initialization of the Options class, where metadata attributes are set up, and the setup_proxy method, where metadata is configured for proxy models. These sections are crucial because the reported issue involves the interaction between a proxy model and its metadata. Specifically, the setup_proxy method sets the primary key for the proxy model to that of its target model, which aligns with the attempted fix mentioned in the issue (replacing cur_model._meta with cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta). This confirms that the search results contain the necessary context to address the reported issue.",

Key methods such as `setup_proxy` and `_populate_directed_relation_graph` are relevant to how Django handles proxy models, which is central to the reported issue. The `setup_proxy` method sets up the metadata for proxy models, including the primary key and database table. The `_populate_directed_relation_graph` method is used to manage relationships within the model graph, which could be relevant when dealing with model relations that involve proxy models. Despite not directly including the line number 745 from the traceback, the methods in this file context are critical for understanding how proxy models' metadata is managed, which is relevant to the issue described. The suggested fix in the issue description about changing how metadata is accessed corresponds to understanding how these methods interact with proxy models.
