The error occurs specifically in the `AnotherModel` model when trying to fetch related `ProxyCustomModel` instances. The error trace suggests that the problem is related to how Django handles model options (`_meta`) for proxy models. The provided solution involves modifying the way model options are accessed in the Django codebase. Therefore, the search should focus on the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file and the `django/db/models/query.py` file, targeting the methods that handle model options and related model fetching. Additionally, investigating the `get_related_populators` function in `django/db/models/query.py` is crucial as it initializes related populators that seem to fail in this scenario.",

The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the django/db/models/query.py file, specifically in the get_related_populators function where it fails to find the primary key 'id' in the list. The user suggests a workaround by replacing 'cur_model._meta' with 'cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta' in django/db/models/sql/query.py at line 745. This implies that the error might be related to how the model metadata is accessed, especially in the context of proxy models.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, several relevant code spans are found:\n1. In django/db/models/sql/query.py, the Query class and its methods such as __init__ and deferred_to_data. The deferred_to_data method specifically deals with deferred loading and includes logic to handle field names and deferred loading, which might be relevant to the issue since the problem occurs with a model's fields.\n2. In django/db/models/query.py, there are several relevant classes and methods, including QuerySet and its methods __init__ and _fetch_all, as well as ModelIterable and its method __iter__. These are directly involved in querying the database and handling the results, which is where the error occurs according to the traceback.\n3. Also in django/db/models/query.py, the RelatedPopulator class and its method __init__, and the function get_related_populators. These deal with populating related objects, which is the step that fails, indicating they are highly relevant to the issue.\n\nGiven the context and the code spans identified, these sections are likely where the fix or further diagnostic information can be found or applied to resolve the issue with select_related() and only() on proxy models.",
