The error traceback indicates that the issue arises due to the inconsistency in the handling of primary key (pk) indexing in the `RelatedPopulator` initialization. This problem is exacerbated when dealing with proxy models, as demonstrated in the provided models and command snippet. The suggested fix involves modifying the `opts` assignment in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to reference the `concrete_model`'s meta options instead of the current model's meta options. \n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, it becomes evident that this file is central to the issue. Specifically, the function `deferred_to_data` and its calls within handle the deferred loading of fields and may be related to the error since it deals with field resolution and loading. Additionally, the `add_to_dict` function, which is used by `deferred_to_data`, plays a role in managing the inclusion and exclusion of fields during the query process. Based on these observations, the relevant code spans include those dealing with model and field handling within the context of deferred loading, particularly where primary keys and related fields are managed. Thus, the identified spans are directly linked to the reported issue and its resolution.",

The traceback indicates that the error occurs at the line `rel_cls = RelatedPopulator(rel_klass_info, select, db)` in `django/db/models/query.py`. The error message `ValueError: 'id' is not in list` suggests that the `init_list` is missing the primary key field 'id'. This indicates that the initialization list generated for the RelatedPopulator is incomplete or incorrect. Reviewing the relevant code spans shows the initialization of RelatedPopulator in `django/db/models/query.py` where `init_list` is constructed based on select fields and model attributes. The `RelatedPopulator.__init__` span is particularly relevant as it initializes `init_list` which is used to determine the fields to be populated. Additionally, the `RelatedPopulator.populate` method uses `init_list` to create model instances. Furthermore, the `QuerySet.only` method determines the fields to be loaded immediately, which could impact the `init_list` in `RelatedPopulator`. Given these findings, the relevant code spans include the initialization of `RelatedPopulator` and the logic in `QuerySet.only` that affects field selection.",

The method iterates over field names and handles deferred loading logic, which can indirectly affect how `select_related` and `only` methods operate. The provided search results also include the `add_to_dict` function, which is used within `deferred_to_data` to manage field inclusion. This function is crucial as it directly contributes to how field selections are processed in the context of deferred loading. Therefore, both `Query.deferred_to_data` and `add_to_dict` are relevant and essential for resolving the reported issue, as they deal with the core logic of handling selected and deferred fields.",

The `deferred_to_data` method in `Query` class plays a key role in deferred loading, which could be related to the issue with `only()` and `select_related()` when used with proxy models. Also, the `def get_related_populators(klass_info, select, db):` function is responsible for getting related populators that could also interact with proxy models. However, there are no explicit interactions or special handling for proxy models within the provided code snippets. This suggests that the issue might be occurring due to the generic handling of model metadata (`opts` variable) without specific considerations for proxy models, leading to the error when the model's primary key ('id') is not found within the fields list. To resolve this, more specific handling or a modification to account for proxy models might be needed in these methods.",
