These sections include:\n\n1. **ModelIterable.__iter__**: This method is responsible for iterating over the queryset results, which is where the error occurs. The method involves constructing the `init_list` and calling `get_related_populators`.\n\n2. **QuerySet.select_related** and **QuerySet.only**: These methods are used in the reported issue and are directly related to the optimization of the queryset leading to the crash.\n\n3. **RelatedPopulator.__init__**: This class is responsible for populating related objects, and the issue occurs when initializing this class due to the primary key index lookup.\n\n4. **get_related_populators**: This function is called to get the related populators and is closely linked to the issue as it involves handling related objects.\n\nGiven these sections of code, it is clear that the provided search results are highly relevant to the reported issue.

The traceback indicates that the error occurs at the point where Django tries to index the primary key field ('id') in the list of fields to be initialized, but it is not found in that list. The user suggests that replacing the line `opts = cur_model._meta` with `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` resolves the issue. This suggests a potential issue with how Django handles meta options for proxy models. \n\nReviewing the provided file context and search results, the relevant code spans include:\n1. The `RelatedPopulator.__init__` method in `django/db/models/query.py`, which contains the line `self.pk_idx = self.init_list.index(self.model_cls._meta.pk.attname)` that fails when 'id' is not in the list.\n2. The `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py`, which handles meta options for models, including proxy models. The `setup_proxy` method seems relevant as it sets up meta options for proxy models.\n3. The `ModelBase.__new__` method in `django/db/models/base.py`, which is responsible for creating model classes, including handling proxy models and their meta options.\n\nThese code spans are likely relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the issue because:\n- The `RelatedPopulator` class is directly involved in populating related objects, which is where the error occurs.\n- The `Options` class manages the meta options for models, and understanding how it handles proxy models is crucial.\n- The `ModelBase` class is the metaclass for Django models, and understanding how it initializes models, including proxy models, is essential.\n\nGiven the user's suggestion to use the concrete model's meta options, it seems that the issue lies in how Django is handling the meta options for proxy models. The code spans provided should be sufficient to identify the root cause and implement a fix.",
