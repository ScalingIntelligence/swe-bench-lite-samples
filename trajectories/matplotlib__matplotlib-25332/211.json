From the search results, two files are relevant: 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py'.

In `figure.py`, the `FigureBase.align_labels` method and the `Figure.__getstate__` and `Figure.__setstate__` methods are relevant. These methods are responsible for aligning labels and handling the state of the figure during pickling operations. Similarly, in `artist.py`, the `Artist.__getstate__` method is relevant as it manages the state of the Artist class, which is a base class for Figure. Other files, such as `lib/matplotlib/dates.py`, `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`, `lib/matplotlib/spines.py`, `lib/matplotlib/transforms.py`, `lib/matplotlib/cbook.py`, and `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py`, contain `__setstate__` methods that may indirectly affect the pickling process but are less directly relevant to the immediate issue.

In 'figure.py', `Figure` and `FigureBase` are defined, with `Figure` inheriting from `FigureBase` which itself inherits from `Artist`. The `Figure` class also has an `__getstate__` method that removes `canvas` from the state and modifies the `_dpi` attribute. Importantly, `Figure` overrides `__setstate__` to handle version compatibility and restore to pylab, but this method doesn't explicitly handle weak references either.
