The search results contain several files and spans of code in the matplotlib library that deal with figure creation, alignment of labels, and pickling. Notable spans include `FigureBase.align_labels`, `Figure.__getstate__`, `Artist.__getstate__`, and others where methods related to state management and serialization are defined. These spans are directly relevant to the issue as they involve the methods called during the pickling process or the alignment of labels just before the pickling operation. The key elements to focus on are the `align_labels` method within the `FigureBase` class and the `__getstate__` methods of various classes to understand how state is managed and potentially pickled. Additionally, the weak reference objects mentioned in the error could be related to how object lifecycle or references are managed within these methods.

The error indicates that a `weakref.ReferenceType` object cannot be pickled. Following the code context provided, we can see that `FigureBase` and `Figure` classes have methods and attributes that manage figure labels and their alignment. However, the actual pickling process seems to involve more complex interactions, likely captured in the `CallbackRegistry` class from `matplotlib.cbook`, as evident from the `Figure.__getstate__` and `Artist.__getstate__` methods. The new search results shed light on how the `CallbackRegistry` manages callbacks and their state during pickling.
