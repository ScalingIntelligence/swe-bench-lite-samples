The error message 'TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object' suggests that there might be an issue with how weak references are handled in the pickling process. To investigate this, it would be helpful to look at the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods in the `Figure` class and possibly related classes like `Artist` and `CallbackRegistry`. Additionally, focusing on the `align_labels` method in the `Figure` class could provide insight into how labels are being aligned and if that process introduces objects that are not pickleable.",

The error message indicates that the pickling process fails due to encountering a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object, which is likely part of the internal state managed by `CallbackRegistry`. The search results include relevant code spans from `Figure` and `CallbackRegistry` classes. The `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods in both `Figure` and `CallbackRegistry` classes are crucial for the pickling process. Specifically, `CallbackRegistry`'s `__getstate__` method attempts to handle the pickling of callbacks by dropping them unless specified otherwise in `self._pickled_cids`. The identified code spans align with the reported issue, providing the necessary context to understand and potentially resolve the pickling issue.\n\nThe identified spans include the relevant initializations and state management methods in the `Figure` and `CallbackRegistry` classes. Specifically, the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods handle the serialization and deserialization of the class state, which is critical for the pickling functionality. This analysis confirms that the search results are relevant to the reported issue, as they directly address the pickling process and the handling of weak references that lead to the TypeError.

The error indicates that a `weakref.ReferenceType` object cannot be pickled. Looking at the current file context and the new search results, it's clear that the `FigureBase` class is relevant, as it contains the implementation of the `align_labels()` method. I also note that the `CallbackRegistry` class from `lib/matplotlib/cbook.py` is involved, as it is used in the `Figure` class for handling events. The `__getstate__` method of `CallbackRegistry` might not be handling the weak references properly, causing the pickling error. From the new search results, the `FigureBase` class seems relevant to the issue because it includes methods for aligning labels. The `Figure` class inherits from `FigureBase`, which further confirms the relevance. Both classes seem to be involved in providing functionality that the user interacts with directly. The pickling process seems to fail because of the presence of weak references that cannot be serialized, and these weak references are managed by `CallbackRegistry`. Therefore, both `Figure` and `CallbackRegistry` are relevant to address the issue. To resolve this, it might be necessary to adjust how weak references are managed in the `CallbackRegistry` class for serialization.",
