The search results include two files: 'cbook.py' and 'figure.py'. In 'cbook.py', there is a `CallbackRegistry` class which includes methods for pickling state management, specifically `__getstate__`. This is relevant because the error might be related to the pickling of callback registry objects, which are used in handling events in Matplotlib. In 'figure.py', the `Figure` class also has a `__getstate__` method, which is similarly responsible for managing the state of the figure during pickling. Both of these methods are crucial for handling the pickling process, and modifications or bugs in these methods could lead to the observed error.",
