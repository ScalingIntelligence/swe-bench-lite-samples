Analyzing the search results, the relevant parts of the codebase seem to be those that involve the `align_labels` method in the `Figure` class and the `CallbackRegistry` class, which manages callbacks and could be related to the weak references causing the issue. Specifically, the spans involving `FigureBase.align_labels`, `Figure.__init__`, `CallbackRegistry.__getstate__`, and `CallbackRegistry.__setstate__` are likely relevant as they deal with the pickling of elements related to the figure such as callbacks and layout settings.
