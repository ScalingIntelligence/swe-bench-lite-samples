The error trace suggests that the issue lies with a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object that cannot be pickled. This indicates a need to inspect the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods of relevant classes in the context of pickling. Given the search results, the relevant files appear to be 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py', 'lib/matplotlib/cbook.py', and 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py'. Specifically, the code spans that are likely relevant include the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods in the 'Artist' and 'Figure' classes, as these methods are crucial for pickling and unpickling objects. Additionally, the 'CallbackRegistry' class in 'cbook.py' may be relevant due to its use of weak references and its own `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods, which could be handling the problematic pickling of 'weakref.ReferenceType' objects. Further inspection of these methods is necessary to determine their role in the pickling process and how they might be contributing to the issue described in the reported bug.",

This issue is likely related to the handling of weak references during the pickling process of the Figure object. The current context shows the `__getstate__` methods in `Artist` and `CallbackRegistry`, which manage the pickling state. The new search results reveal the `FigureBase` class and its `align_labels` method, which initializes label alignment groups using `cbook.Grouper()`. This context is crucial because it suggests that the weak references are being used in a way that interferes with pickling. The alignment of labels might be introducing these weak references, which are not being handled correctly in the pickling process.

Specifically, we notice that the `Figure` class implements the `align_labels()` method, which in turn calls `align_xlabels()` and `align_ylabels()`. However, it appears that while `align_labels()` exists, the exact interactions with `Artist` or `CallbackRegistry` classes during alignment are not explicitly detailed in the provided context. To deeply understand the interaction with `CallbackRegistry`, we may need to inspect how these alignment methods integrate with callbacks or state changes that can impact pickling. It is recommended to further inspect the behavior within and around the `align_xlabels()` and `align_ylabels()` methods, which should be located in the same module or associated files, and to analyze any callback triggering or state modifications. This will help in identifying potential weak references or other variables that are not picklable.",
