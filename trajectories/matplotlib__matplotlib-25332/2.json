Given this, the key areas to focus on in the search results would be the `__getstate__` methods and relevant properties that might be causing the pickling error. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that both `Artist` and `Figure` classes from the `matplotlib` library have `__getstate__` methods that exclude specific attributes during pickling. Additionally, the `CallbackRegistry` class from the `cbook` module also has a `__getstate__` method that deals with pickling callbacks. These methods are critical for understanding how pickling is handled in the context of matplotlib figures and artists. Furthermore, the `Figure.__init__` method initializes a CallbackRegistry with signals, which could be related to the 'weakref.ReferenceType' object mentioned in the error message. Therefore, the relevant code spans to focus on would be from the `matplotlib/artist.py`, `matplotlib/cbook.py`, and `matplotlib/figure.py` files, particularly focusing on the `__getstate__` and initialization sections of these classes.",
