The provided search results contain several relevant sections of code from the `matplotlib` library that could be related to this issue. Specifically, the `FigureBase` class and its `align_labels` method are involved in the alignment of labels, which is the operation that precedes the failure in pickling. The `Figure` class, which inherits from `FigureBase`, also includes methods and attributes that might be relevant to pickling, such as its `__getstate__` method. Additionally, the `Artist` class, which `FigureBase` inherits from, includes a `__getstate__` method that might be involved in the pickling process. Finally, the `CallbackRegistry` class could also be relevant, as it deals with callbacks and includes methods for pickling state. Based on these observations, it seems that the provided search results contain code spans that are likely relevant to resolving the pickling issue. Therefore, the identified code spans are considered relevant to the reported issue.",
