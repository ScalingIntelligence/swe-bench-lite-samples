To address this, we need to identify the parts of the code responsible for the alignment of labels and pickling. From the provided file context, several relevant code spans are already identified, such as `FigureBase.__init__`, `FigureBase.align_labels`, and `Figure.__getstate__`.

The focus should be on ensuring that all necessary objects and states required for pickling are properly handled, especially those modified or created by `align_labels`.
