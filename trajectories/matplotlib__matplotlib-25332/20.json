The error message indicates a problem with pickling a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object. This suggests that the weak reference created by the `align_labels()` method is not being handled properly during pickling. The relevant code for the `align_labels()` method is likely found in either the `figure.py` or `axes/_base.py` files, as these are the locations where methods related to figure and axes alignment are defined. To debug the issue, it is necessary to focus on the `align_labels()` method and the `__getstate__` methods in the `Figure`, `AxesBase`, and potentially other related classes to understand how they handle the weak references and state during pickling.",

The problem seems to stem from the `CallbackRegistry` class in the `matplotlib.cbook` module, which uses weak references that are not pickleable. To solve this, we need to ensure that the `CallbackRegistry`'s `__getstate__` method does not include non-pickleable objects, specifically weak references. We should modify the `__getstate__` method to handle this appropriately.",
