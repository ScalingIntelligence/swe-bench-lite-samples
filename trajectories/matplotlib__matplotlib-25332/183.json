In the search results, I found `__getstate__` methods within both the `Artist` and `Figure` classes, which could be relevant to pickling. I also noted the `Figure` class initialization which initializes properties related to figures and axes, which could be affecting the pickling process. Based on these findings, I selected relevant spans including the `__getstate__` methods and the `Figure` initialization to investigate further.
