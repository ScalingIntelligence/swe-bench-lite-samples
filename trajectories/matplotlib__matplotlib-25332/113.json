The error message indicates that a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object cannot be pickled. This suggests that the issue may be related to how the `align_labels()` method affects the figure object's state, particularly in terms of any weak references that might be involved in the alignment process. To address this, it's crucial to inspect the `__getstate__` methods of the `Figure` class and its related classes (like `_AxesBase` and `Artist`) to ensure all necessary state information is included for pickling. From the search results, I've identified relevant spans within `figure.py` (specifically the `__getstate__` method), `axes/_base.py` (also the `__getstate__` method), and `artist.py` (the `__getstate__` method once again). These methods are critical for defining what state is serialized when a figure (or its components) is pickled. The provided code spans appear to be directly relevant to the issue as they handle the state of the figure, axes, and artists during pickling. Further inspection might be needed to ensure all weak references or other non-picklable objects are managed appropriately.",
