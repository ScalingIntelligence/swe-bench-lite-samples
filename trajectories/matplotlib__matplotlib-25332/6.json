The search results provide several relevant code spans from `matplotlib/figure.py` and `matplotlib/cbook.py`. In `matplotlib/figure.py`, the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods of the `Figure` class appear relevant as they handle the pickling process. Additionally, in `matplotlib/cbook.py`, the `CallbackRegistry` class methods `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` also seem pertinent for pickling the callback registry. Further analysis of the code indicates that the `CallbackRegistry` class is involved in handling the event callbacks, which are likely to be related to the alignment of labels and could be causing the pickle error. The code spans identified directly relate to pickling and managing potentially problematic objects such as references to callbacks, suggesting they resolve the reported issue.",
