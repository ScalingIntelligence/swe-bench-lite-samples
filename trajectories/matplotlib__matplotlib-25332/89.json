This error specifically mentions a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object, indicating that there might be an issue with how references are handled in the `align_labels` method or other related methods. In the provided search results, several key spans are identified that might be relevant. The `FigureBase` class contains the `align_labels` method which is likely the method being called in the user's code. Additionally, the `Figure` class, which inherits from `FigureBase`, contains initialization code that sets up various properties and callbacks, which could be related to the pickling issue. The inclusion of `weakref` in the error message suggests that there might be weak references being used somewhere in the code that are not compatible with pickling. The identified code spans include the `FigureBase.__init__` and `Figure.__init__` methods, which initialize the figure and set up its properties and callbacks. These spans are relevant because they initialize and configure the figure, which is the object being pickled. By examining these spans, we can understand how the figure is set up and potentially identify any weak references or other elements that might cause the pickling failure.",

The issue specifically mentions a `TypeError` when trying to pickle a figure that has called `align_labels()`, indicating that there might be an issue with the pickling process related to some state or object that `align_labels()` modifies. Given the existing context, I see that the `Figure` class has already been identified, and it contains methods related to pickling (`__getstate__`, `__setstate__`). Additionally, relevant spans from the search results include `Figure.__getstate__` and `Figure.__setstate__`, which are crucial for pickling functionality. However, the `TypeError` mentioned in the issue indicates a problem with pickling an object of type `weakref.ReferenceType`, which might be related to the `CallbackRegistry` class, as this class is involved in event handling and might use weak references. Also, the `_AxesBase` class has relevant methods for pickling (`__getstate__`, `__setstate__`), which might affect the pickling of the figure if axes are involved in the `align_labels()` call. Based on this analysis, the next steps should be to focus on improving the pickling process for objects that `Figure` and `_AxesBase` might reference, especially handling weak references carefully.",
