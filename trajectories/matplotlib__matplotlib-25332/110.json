            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the inability to pickle a figure after calling `align_labels()`. The error is specifically related to a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object not being picklable. This suggests that the issue could be related to the state of the Figure object and its management of callbacks, weak references, or other internal objects during pickling. The provided search results include the `Figure` class from `matplotlib/figure.py` and its `__getstate__` method, which is a likely candidate for investigating the pickling process. The `Figure.__getstate__` method is responsible for creating a dictionary representation of the Figure's state. The method removes 'canvas' and other fields that might not be picklable. It also handles versioning and restoring to PyLab, but does not explicitly address the weak reference issue. Given that the context already includes relevant code, the next logical step would be to examine if any objects within the Figure that might contain weak references are properly managed during the pickling process. Identifying and resolving any weak reference issues in `Figure.__getstate__` or other related methods could be crucial for solving this bug. However, without additional search results directly related to handling weak references within the Figure's state or connected components, the investigation may need to expand beyond the provided results.",
