The issue suggests that certain objects, possibly within the `weakref.ReferenceType`, are not being properly handled during pickling. This could be related to how the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods are defined or used within the `_AxesBase` and `Figure` classes. Upon examining the search results, it's observed that both `_AxesBase` and `Figure` have custom `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods. These methods are crucial for pickling and unpickling objects, handling state management without including non-picklable components like `canvas`. The search results also reveal the initialization and state management of `Axes` objects, which might be relevant to understanding the pickling issue since `align_labels()` affects label alignment across multiple Axes. Given this information, the relevant code spans to investigate further are those pertaining to custom pickling methods (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`) in both classes.",
