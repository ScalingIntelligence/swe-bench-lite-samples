This suggests that the `align_labels()` method introduces a state or object that is not picklable. By examining the provided search results, I identified relevant code spans in the `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` file, specifically focusing on the `Figure` class and its methods related to alignment and pickling. The `Figure.__getstate__` and `Figure.__setstate__` methods, which handle the state for pickling and unpickling, do not explicitly account for the state changes introduced by `align_labels()`. Additionally, the `FigureBase.align_labels` method groups axes labels but does not address potential issues with pickling afterwards. The search results provide a comprehensive view of how the `Figure` class and its base class handle state management, but do not offer specific solutions or modifications to address the pickling issue introduced by `align_labels()`. Further investigation into how `align_labels()` affects the picklable state is necessary to resolve the issue.",
