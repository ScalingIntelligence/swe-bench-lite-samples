The error message indicates that a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object cannot be pickled. This suggests that there might be an issue with how certain objects are being handled or referenced in the Figure class during the pickling process.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant parts of the code to examine are the `Figure.__init__` and `Figure.__getstate__` methods. The `__init__` method sets up the figure, including the layout engine, callbacks, and various properties. The `__getstate__` method prepares the figure for pickling by defining what attributes should be included in the state when pickled. This method specifically removes 'canvas' from the state, which is essential because the canvas, being an interactive object, is not picklable.\n\nBoth spans are relevant because they provide insight into how the Figure is initialized and how its state is managed for serialization. The error might be due to some weak reference being inadvertently included in the state, or because the layout engine modifications by `align_labels` introduce non-picklable elements. Further investigation within these sections of the code will be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause.",

The error message indicates a problem with 'weakref.ReferenceType' object which suggests that there might be references to objects that cannot be pickled. The provided file context includes the `Figure` class and its methods such as `__init__`, `__getstate__`, and `align_labels`. In the `Figure` class, `align_labels()` calls `align_xlabels()` and `align_ylabels()`, which are also present in the context. These methods manage alignment groups for axis labels, which might be related to the reference type issue since they manipulate axes and labels. The new search results provide additional context for `align_xlabels()` and `align_ylabels()`, showing how they organize axes based on their positions. Since the issue is about specific methods in the `Figure` class and the provided code spans cover the methods related to alignment and the pickling state, this search result seems relevant.",
