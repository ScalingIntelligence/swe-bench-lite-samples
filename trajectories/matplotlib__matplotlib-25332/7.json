The `align_labels` function influences this management potentially introducing elements which can't be serialized. Modifying the `__getstate__` method in the `Figure` class to exclude problematic fields related to label alignment when pickled seems a viable approach to resolve this issue. Notably, excluding `_align_label_groups` should suffice as it directly handles the alignment state which is not required post deserialization.\n\nThe proposed change focuses on ensuring that '_align_label_groups' is omitted during the serialization process, thereby eliminating the 'weakref.ReferenceType' objects causing the type error upon pickling. This aligns with the principle of minimal interference with the current implementation and addresses only necessary parts for the serialization to be successful.\n\nPermission to proceed with this specific change is requested to ensure the functionality of the `Figure` class in scenarios involving pickling after aligning labels. This is critical as the current state propagates Python's weak reference objects which are unfit for pickling according to standard library behavior.",
