The search results contain several key methods and properties in the `Figure` class, which is relevant to the issue. Specifically, the `__init__`, `__getstate__`, and `__setstate__` methods are of particular interest. These methods are involved in the creation and state management of a `Figure` object, which includes the pickling process. The `__getstate__` method is responsible for defining what parts of the figure should be included in the pickle, and the `__setstate__` method is used to restore the state when unpickling. By examining these methods, we can determine if there are any weak references or other problematic objects that might be causing the pickling to fail.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified spans should include the `__getstate__` method to understand how the figure's state is being handled during pickling.

The method is responsible for organizing subplots within a figure to ensure that labels are aligned properly, enhancing the visual consistency of the plot. There is a management of state and the handling of attributes like `canvas`, which could be related to the weak reference issue during pickling, as the `canvas` attribute is explicitly removed from the state in the `__getstate__` method to prevent pickling issues related to the callback registry and event handling. Further examination of the `align_labels()`, `align_xlabels()`, and `align_ylabels()` methods in detail, alongside their interactions with other objects and the broader state of the `Figure` instance, might reveal additional contexts or dependencies that do not support pickling well, such as the use of weak references or callbacks that could be problematic during the serialization process.",

The error specifically mentions a `TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object`. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the `align_labels()` method modifies the figure state or interacts with other objects that are not picklable. From the provided code context and search results, several key parts of the codebase are relevant:\n\n1. The `FigureBase.align_labels()` method, which calls `align_xlabels()` and `align_ylabels()` to align the labels of subplots.\n2. The `FigureBase.align_xlabels()` and `FigureBase.align_ylabels()` methods, which handle the alignment of x and y labels respectively.\n3. The `Figure.__init__()` method, which initializes the figure and its properties.\n4. The `Figure.__getstate__()` and `Figure.__setstate__()` methods, which handle the pickling and unpickling of the figure.\n\nGiven that the error occurs when trying to pickle the figure after `align_labels()` has been called, it's important to ensure that the state modifications made by `align_labels()` do not introduce unpicklable objects or states. The relevant code spans are those that deal directly with the state of the figure and its axes, particularly those that modify or use the `_align_label_groups` attribute of `FigureBase`.",
