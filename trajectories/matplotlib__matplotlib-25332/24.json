In `lib/matplotlib/cbook.py`, the `CallbackRegistry` class and its methods `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` are directly related to pickling and may be involved in the issue. In `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, the `Figure` class and its methods `__init__`, `__getstate__`, and `__setstate__` are also related to pickling. Additionally, the `Figure` class includes the `align_labels` method which is directly referenced in the reported issue.

These code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and should be closely examined to diagnose and resolve the pickling problem.",

This suggests that the issue might be related to how the `CallbackRegistry` or the `Figure` class handles weak references during the pickling process.\n\nThe current file context already highlights the `CallbackRegistry` class and its pickle-related methods (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`) in the `cbook.py` file, as well as the `Figure` class and its pickle-related methods (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`) in the `figure.py` file.\n\nThe new search results reconfirm the presence of the `Figure` class and its pickle-related methods in the `figure.py` file, as well as the `CallbackRegistry` class and its pickle-related methods in the `cbook.py` file. This reiterates the importance of these methods in addressing the pickling issue.\n\nGiven the strong correlation between the reported issue and the code spans involving pickle methods in both the `Figure` and `CallbackRegistry` classes, it is evident that these spans are highly relevant to resolving the bug. The presence of weak references in the `CallbackRegistry` class and its handling during pickling are particularly critical, as the error message directly mentions a problem with pickling a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object.\n\nTherefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those that involve the pickle-related methods of both the `Figure` class and the `CallbackRegistry` class.",
