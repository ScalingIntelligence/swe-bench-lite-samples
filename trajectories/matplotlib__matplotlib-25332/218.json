The error indicates that a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object cannot be pickled. Given this, the focus should be on the methods and attributes of the `Figure` class that might relate to pickling. In the search results, two important sections are identified related to the `Figure` class: the `__getstate__` method in both `Artist` and `Figure` classes. The `__getstate__` method is responsible for customizing the state that is saved and restored during pickling, which is crucial for addressing the pickling error described. Specifically, the `Figure.__getstate__` overrides the method to handle the canvas attribute and other specific configurations that might be causing the pickling failure. Additionally, the `Artist.__getstate__` method is a base implementation that also deals with state handling during pickling. These sections of code are directly relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the pickling issue with figures after calling `align_labels()`. Therefore, the identified spans should include these methods to address the reported issue.",

Since the relevant pickling methods are provided in the file context and it's clear that the error occurs with the alignment of labels, it can be inferred that the issue lies in the interaction of align_labels() with the pickling process. However, the specific implementation of align_labels() itself is not provided, and without that, it's not possible to confirm the exact cause of the pickling failure directly from the file context.

This indicates a problem with how the `align_labels` method affects the state of the Figure object, specifically in a way that is incompatible with pickling. Given the provided context, the relevant parts of the codebase are found in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, where the `FigureBase` class and its methods `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels` are located. These methods manage the alignment of axis labels, and it is suspected that one or more of the objects they manipulate are causing the pickling error. The `FigureBase.__getstate__` method, which is responsible for defining the state of the object during pickling, does not currently handle the `_align_label_groups` attribute that `align_xlabels` and `align_ylabels` manipulate. This could be the root cause of the issue. Therefore, the identified spans to focus on are the methods `align_xlabels`, `align_ylabels`, and the `__getstate__` method in the `FigureBase` class in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`.",
