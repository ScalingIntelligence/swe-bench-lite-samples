Specifically, it raises a TypeError due to an attempt to pickle a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object. The search results include code spans from two files: 'artist.py' and 'figure.py'. In 'artist.py', the '__getstate__' method of the Artist class is relevant as it defines how the state of the Artist object is serialized, which is crucial for pickling. In 'figure.py', the '__getstate__' and '__setstate__' methods of the Figure class are essential for understanding how a Figure object is pickled and unpickled. These methods manage the serialization and deserialization of the Figure object, including handling properties such as '_dpi', '_restore_to_pylab', and 'canvas'.
