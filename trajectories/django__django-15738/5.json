Identify the relevant code spans that handle alterations of unique_together constraints, as this constraint cannot be directly applied to a ManyToMany field. The code spans related to 'AlterTogetherOptionOperation' and its methods 'database_forwards' and 'database_backwards' are crucial for understanding how to remove and reapply constraints.\n\n2. Look for operations that manage fields like 'AlterField' and 'AddField', especially in the context of migrations (fields.py and schema.py).\n\n3. Understand how constraints are added and removed via 'AddConstraint' and 'RemoveConstraint' operations.\n\n4. Ensure understanding of the database-specific schema editor implementations (e.g., sqlite3, oracle) for potential nuances in managing constraints and altering fields.\n\nBy reviewing all provided code spans and understanding their role in managing model alterations and constraints, we can identify the necessary steps and relevant code to address the migration issue efficiently.",
