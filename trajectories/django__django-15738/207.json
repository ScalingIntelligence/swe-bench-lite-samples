In 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py', the 'AlterUniqueTogether' class and its '__init__' method are directly related to altering the unique_together constraint, which is a key part of the issue. Additionally, the 'RemoveConstraint' class and its '__init__' method might be relevant for removing the unique_together constraint before altering the field. In 'django/db/migrations/state.py', the 'ProjectState' class and its methods, such as 'alter_field' and 'update_model_field_relation', are relevant as they deal with altering fields and handling relations, which are crucial when changing a field from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField.

After that change the field from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.\nBut in this way I have 2 migrations instead of one.\nI added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to see this error.\n"
