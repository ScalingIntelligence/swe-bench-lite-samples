The reported issue describes an error during the migration process, specifically a `ValueError` related to the `unique_together` constraint being absent. The solution involves separating the migration into two steps: first, removing the `unique_together` constraint, and then changing the field type. The search results include relevant code spans from `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` that handle model operations such as `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterField`, which are crucial for implementing the required changes. Additionally, the `ProjectState` class from `django/db/migrations/state.py` is examined for its role in managing the state of models during migrations, particularly the `alter_field` method that handles field changes. These code spans directly address the issue by providing the necessary mechanisms to alter model fields and constraints.",
