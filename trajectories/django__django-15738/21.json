The 'AlterUniqueTogether' class and the '__init__' method within this class is critical for understanding how Django handles changes to the unique_together constraint. This is directly relevant to the issue at hand, as it involves changing or removing a unique_together constraint.\n\nAdditionally, the 'ProjectState' class and its methods, particularly 'alter_field' and 'update_model_field_relation', will likely be needed to understand and perform the required field alteration from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField. These methods are crucial for the field alteration process and could potentially be parts of the migration scripts that should be written or adjusted. It's important that the migration script first removes the unique_together constraint before changing the field type, aligning with the user's manual solution steps.\n\nThese code spans provide a foundation for writing or adjusting the Django migration scripts to achieve the desired change in the Authors model, ensuring the unique_together constraint is handled correctly.",
