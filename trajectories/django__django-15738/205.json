The error occurs during migration because the database is looking for a unique constraint that no longer exists after changing the field type. To resolve this, the steps involve first removing the `unique_together` constraint, making migrations, and then changing the field type and making migrations again. The relevant files and functions to investigate are those related to the Django migration operations, state management, and database schema editing, particularly those handling unique constraints and field alterations.",
