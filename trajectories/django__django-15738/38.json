The error 'ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)' indicates a problem with handling the unique constraint during the migration. The solution suggested is to first remove the unique_together constraint, make migrations, and then change the field to ManyToManyField and make migrations again. Target relevant files and functions in the Django migration logic to understand how unique_together constraints are handled during migrations.",

The search results provided include operations related to model migrations, specifically focusing on altering fields and table constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the relevance: First, 'AlterField' in 'django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py' is pertinent as it involves altering fields, which is a necessary step when changing the field type. Second, the 'RenameIndex' class in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' is also relevant, as it involves renaming database indexes, which could be necessary if there are any changes to index names based on field alterations. Third, 'AlterTogetherOptionOperation' in the same file targets operations on options like 'unique_together', which directly addresses the need to remove the constraint as part of the migration. Lastly, the 'ManyToManyField' class in 'django/db/models/fields/related.py' is crucial as it provides the core functionality to handle many-to-many relationships, aligning with the required change in the reported issue.",
