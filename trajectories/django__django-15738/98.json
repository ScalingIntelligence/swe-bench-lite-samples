To resolve this, we need to look at the migration operations related to altering unique_together constraints and how the ManyToManyField is handled during migrations. We should focus our search on the django/db directory, particularly the migrations subdirectory, to find relevant code handling these specific operations.",

After that change the field from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.\nBut in this way I have 2 migrations instead of one.\nI added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to see this error.\n"
