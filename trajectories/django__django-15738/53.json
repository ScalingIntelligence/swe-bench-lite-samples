The error message 'ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)' suggests that the migration operation is not correctly handling the removal of the unique constraint. Given the context, it's necessary to search for the relevant part of the Django codebase that handles these operations: the logic for altering unique_together constraints and transitioning fields between ForeignKey and ManyToMany. The provided code files indicate locations in the Django codebase that might handle these changes, especially `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`. Additionally, since the error seems to be related to database migration operations, also focus on the schema editor files for various databases, such as `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` and `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`.",

Specifically, the 'AlterUniqueTogether' operation, the 'alter_unique_together' method in the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class, and the '_alter_field' method are all pertinent to handling unique constraints and altering fields. Additionally, the '_alter_many_to_many' method in both the 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' and specific database backend schema editors (SQLite, PostgreSQL) is crucial for managing ManyToMany field changes. The presence of these methods and operations indicates that there is a clear pathway within Django's migration framework to handle the specific change required in the issue. However, the particular implementation of handling the transition from ForeignKey to ManyToMany while simultaneously managing unique constraints is complex and might require detailed attention in the migration scripts. The provided context does not explicitly show how the migration script was written, which might contain the exact operations causing the ValueError. Nevertheless, the identified parts of the codebase suggest that the infrastructure is present to facilitate these changes, and the error likely stems from sequence or correct operation application rather than an absent framework feature.",
