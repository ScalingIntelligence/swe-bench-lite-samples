These classes include methods like `alter_unique_together`, `_alter_field`, and `_alter_many_to_many` that are crucial for handling the migration of fields and constraints as described in the issue. The methods cover operations like altering fields, handling unique constraints, and managing many-to-many relationships, which are directly related to the task of converting the `project_data_set` field from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField and adjusting the unique_together constraint appropriately. This context is sufficient to understand how such migrations can be managed in Django, though practical execution would require the specific project's models and initial migrations to be intact and compatible with these operations.",
