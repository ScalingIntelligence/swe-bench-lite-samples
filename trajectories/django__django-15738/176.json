Based on the provided search results, we should focus on sections where the `MigrationAutodetector` class and the `ProjectState` class are defined, as these are central to Django's migration process. Specifically, we should look at the `alter_field` method in `ProjectState`, which is responsible for modifying fields in a model state during migrations. This method is crucial because changing a field from a ForeignKey to ManyToManyField could trigger the need to modify or remove unique constraints, which is a core part of the issue described. Therefore, the relevant code spans would include the initialization of the `MigrationAutodetector` and the `alter_field` method.
