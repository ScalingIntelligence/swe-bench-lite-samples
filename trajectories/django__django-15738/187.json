The issue specifically mentions the need to migrate the `project_data_set` field in the `Authors` model from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField, which involves removing the `unique_together` constraint. Analyzing the provided search results, we find relevant code spans in `django/db/migrations/state.py` and `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. In `django/db/migrations/state.py`, the `ProjectState` class and its methods `add_constraint`, `remove_constraint`, and `update_model_field_relation` are crucial for managing model constraints and field relations during migrations. In `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class and its method `alter_unique_together` are vital for executing the SQL commands required to alter unique constraints. These sections of the code are directly related to managing the unique constraints and field changes as described in the reported issue.",

To address this, I need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with altering fields and constraints in Django's migration framework. The search results include several relevant sections, especially those dealing with 'alter_field', 'add_constraint', and 'remove_constraint' methods in both the 'ProjectState' class (handling the state of models) and 'BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor' class (handling schema alterations). These methods are crucial for handling field changes and constraint manipulations during migrations.

These are necessary to address the issue because they provide the functionality to remove constraints which is a key step in the migration process when changing the field type. The methods identified are `ProjectState.remove_constraint`, `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.remove_constraint`, and `DatabaseSchemaEditor.remove_constraint`, all of which are crucial for handling the constraint removal for different database backend types and within the migration framework itself.",
