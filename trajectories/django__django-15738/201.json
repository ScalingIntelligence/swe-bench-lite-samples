These include the 'AlterUniqueTogether' class and its methods, such as 'database_forwards' and 'database_backwards', which manage the changes to unique_together constraints during migrations. Additionally, there are methods like 'generate_removed_altered_unique_together' and 'generate_altered_unique_together' in the 'MigrationAutodetector' class that automate the detection and generation of these changes. The 'RemoveConstraint' class and its methods are also relevant for explicitly removing constraints.
