The issue requires changing the `project_data_set` field in the `Authors` model from a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField`, which involves removing the `unique_together` constraint since it cannot be applied to a `ManyToManyField`. The provided search results yield two critical files: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`. The first file contains the `RemoveConstraint` class, which is pertinent as it handles the removal of constraints during migrations. The `RemoveConstraint` class includes methods for both forward (`database_forwards`) and backward (`database_backwards`) database operations, making it essential for addressing the constraint removal required in the reported issue. The second file, `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`, includes the `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class, which contains the `_alter_many_to_many` method. This method is specifically tailored to handle changes involving `ManyToManyField` fields during schema editing. Given the nature of the reported issue (switching a field type and managing constraints), both of these files and their respective methods are relevant to correctly execute the required changes.",
