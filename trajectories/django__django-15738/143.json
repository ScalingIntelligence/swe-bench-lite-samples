This change necessitates removing the `unique_together` constraint from the `Authors` model as it cannot be applied to a ManyToManyField. The current code does not handle the removal of the `unique_together` constraint before altering the field type correctly, leading to the mentioned error. The solution involves first removing the `unique_together` constraint in a migration and then altering the field type in another migration. However, the goal is to achieve this in a single migration to avoid multiple steps.
