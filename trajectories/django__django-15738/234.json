The search results provide several relevant code spans dealing with schema editing, particularly around altering fields and unique together constraints. The most relevant code spans are related to altering fields and managing unique constraints. Specifically:\n\n- In `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, methods `alter_unique_together` and `alter_field` are particularly relevant. `alter_unique_together` method handles changes to the unique_together constraint, which is crucial for dealing with the constraint before changing the field type. The `alter_field` method is also critical as it handles the alteration of the field itself, which is the core task when changing from a foreign key to a many-to-many field.\n\n- Details about handling many-to-many fields are found in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._alter_many_to_many`, which suggests a direct method for altering fields of this type.\n\nFocusing on these methods and their implementation in subclasses like `DatabaseSchemaEditor` for specific databases will provide a clear path on how to implement the changes. These spans include handling alterations to unique constraints, managing through models for many-to-many fields, and dealing with the database-specific aspects of such changes.",

After that change the field from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.\nBut in this way I have 2 migrations instead of one.\nI added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to see this error.\n"
