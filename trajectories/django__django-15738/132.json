These methods handle field alterations and relation updates, which are crucial for managing the state during migrations. The method 'alter_field' is especially relevant as it deals with modifying fields, potentially handling the transition from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField and managing the accompanying changes in constraints like 'unique_together'. The 'update_model_field_relation' method is also potentially useful for managing the relational changes when converting a ForeignKey to ManyToManyField.

The error encountered suggests that the migration process is struggling with the absence of expected constraints. The provided search results include operations to alter the `unique_together` setting and manage constraints, which are directly relevant to solving the problem. Specifically, the `AlterUniqueTogether` operation can be used to remove the `unique_together` constraint. Additionally, the `AddConstraint` and `RemoveConstraint` operations can be used to manage constraints when changing the field type. The existing code spans show the necessary methods and classes for making these changes in a migration. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans in the search results are sufficient to guide the migration process.",

However, the actual model definitions and their unique_together constraints are not part of this context. Therefore, a targeted search is needed to locate the specific models (`Authors`, `DataSet`, `Project`, `ProjectDataSet`) and their unique_together definitions.
