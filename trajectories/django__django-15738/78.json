The problem arises when generating migrations, specifically with the error indicating a mismatch in the number of constraints. The provided search results contain critical sections of code from Django's migration framework, which are likely to be relevant for understanding and resolving this issue.\n\nThe `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` is responsible for detecting changes between the current and desired model states. The `__init__` method sets up the initial states and a questioner for interactive migrations. This class is crucial for identifying the changes necessary to migrate from a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField`.\n\nThe `ProjectState` class in `django/db/migrations/state.py` manages the state of the project's models during migrations. Methods like `alter_field` and `update_model_field_relation` are particularly relevant, as they handle the alteration of fields and the updating of relations between models. These methods will play a key role in updating the `project_data_set` field and managing its relationships post-transformation.\n\nGiven these insights, the identified code spans within these two files are highly relevant to the reported issue. They deal directly with the manipulation of fields and relations, which are central to resolving the migration error.",
