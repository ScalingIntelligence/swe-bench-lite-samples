            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a Django model migration where the 'project_data_set' field in the 'Authors' model needs to be changed from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField. This change necessitates the removal of the 'unique_together' constraint, which cannot be applied to a ManyToManyField. The issue is that attempting to perform this migration in one step results in an error, requiring the migration to be split into two steps to first remove the 'unique_together' constraint and then change the field type.\n\nGiven the search results, the key part of the code to focus on is the 'AlterUniqueTogether' class within 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py'. This class is specifically designed to handle changes to the 'unique_together' option in Django models, which is directly relevant to the reported issue. The '__init__' method of this class is responsible for initializing the operation with the model name and the new 'unique_together' setting, making it a critical point for understanding and potentially implementing the necessary migration operations.\n\nThe provided code spans are relevant because they reveal the internal mechanisms Django uses to alter model options such as 'unique_together'. Understanding this can help in manually crafting the migration steps, possibly combining the two migrations into one more complex operation if supported by Django's migration framework. However, as of now, based on the information provided in the search results, there isn't a direct solution provided for combining the two migrations, indicating that the current approach of two separate migrations might be the only known solution.",
