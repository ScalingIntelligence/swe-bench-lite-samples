The reported issue indicates a need to change the 'project_data_set' field in the 'Authors' model from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField and remove the 'unique_together' constraint due to the transition. The issue also involves handling migration errors related to the change. The search results reveal relevant parts of the codebase handling these specific tasks. Notably, the 'AlterUniqueTogether' operation in 'django/db/migrations/operations/models.py' and the 'alter_unique_together' method in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' are directly related to managing the unique_together constraints. Additionally, the 'alter_field' method in 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' and the '_alter_many_to_many' method are crucial for altering fields from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField. These sections of the codebase are central to resolving the reported issue, ensuring that altering the field type and managing unique constraints are handled correctly during migrations.",
