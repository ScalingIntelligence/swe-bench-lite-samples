The error encountered during migration indicates that the system is trying to find constraints related to the Authors model\u2019s fields but is not finding any. The solution involves first removing the 'unique_together' constraint, performing a migration, and then altering the field type. To address this issue, we need to search for the specific operations and methods related to altering unique_together constraints and changing field types in Django's migration framework. Key files to focus on would be those handling migration operations, state changes, and schema editing operations for different database backends. We should search for specific functions like 'AlterUniqueTogether', 'remove_constraint', and 'alter_field' across the relevant files.",
