The issue provides specific error messages during the migration process related to the unique constraint. The search results include several relevant code spans that could help resolve this issue. In `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, there are classes like `AlterUniqueTogether` which could be used to remove the unique constraint before modifying the field type. This operation is crucial for handling the migration described. Other relevant spans include `database_forwards` methods in the `AlterUniqueTogether` class, which actually perform the alteration on the database schema. Additionally, in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class and its method `alter_unique_together` are relevant as they provide the base implementation for altering unique constraints across different database backends. This method is used by the migration operations to apply the necessary changes to the schema. The `alter_field` method in the same file is also relevant as it handles the altering of field types. In the backend-specific files, such as `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` and `django/db/backends/oracle/schema.py`, there are implementations of how each backend handles the alteration of fields and unique constraints, providing insight into potential errors and how to handle them. Overall, these code spans provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing the migration process as described in the issue.",
