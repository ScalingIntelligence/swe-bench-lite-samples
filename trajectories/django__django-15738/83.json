The operations like 'AlterUniqueTogether' and 'AlterField' are particularly relevant to the issue of changing a field from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField while dealing with unique constraints. However, the context lacks explicit handling or guidance on how to manage the transition between these fields in a single migration, which is central to resolving the reported issue. This suggests that while the core components for handling unique_together constraints and field alterations are present, specific edge cases or detailed migration strategies for transitioning between different field types (especially ForeignKey to ManyToManyField) might not be fully addressed in the provided context.",
