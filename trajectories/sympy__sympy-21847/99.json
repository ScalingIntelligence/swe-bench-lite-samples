The search results show the implementation of `itermonomials` within the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. This file contains the function that is directly related to the issue as it is responsible for generating the monomials. Inside this function, the logic around the `total_degree` parameter seems to be the critical part where the problem might lie. It appears to be generating monomials based on complete combinations when commutative variables are involved. However, it does not clearly handle the inclusion of all monomials that meet the total degree criteria when `min_degree` is specified.
