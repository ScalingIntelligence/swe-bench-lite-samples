Specifically, the function does not include all monomials of total degree equal to `min_degrees`. After analyzing the provided code span, it is evident that the function handles the `min_degrees` argument by ensuring that the highest power in the monomial is not less than `min_degrees`. However, this approach does not account for the requirement that the total degree of the monomial should be between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`, inclusive. The function's current logic might be overlooking other monomials that meet the total degree requirement but do not have individual variable degrees meeting `min_degrees`. This discrepancy in logic is likely the cause of the reported issue. Identifying and fixing this logic in the `itermonomials` function should resolve the issue.
