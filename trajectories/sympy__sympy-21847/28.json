This discrepancy needs to be addressed by examining the `itermonomials` function and any related logic in the `sympy` codebase.

To address this, we need to focus on the part of the code responsible for generating monomials with respect to the `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` arguments. The provided search results include the `itermonomials` function, which is the likely source of the problem. The function logic includes checks for argument sizes, negative degree values, and then proceeds to generate monomials based on whether a total degree or individual degrees are specified. The section of the code responsible for generating monomials with total degree (when `total_degree` is True) seems to be the area of interest as it doesn't yield all expected monomials that match the total degree specified by `min_degrees`. This function is identified as relevant based on the description of the issue and should be inspected further to ensure all monomials of the specified degree are correctly generated and yielded.",

This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
