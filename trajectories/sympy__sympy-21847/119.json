This issue specifically points out that the function does not generate monomials like `x1*x2**2` or `x2*x3**2` when the `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are both set to 3. This behavior contradicts the function's documented behavior, which states that it will generate all monomials such that `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`. The analysis of the `itermonomials` function in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file shows that the function handles two cases: one for total degree with commutative variables and another for individual degrees without checking commutative properties. The bug likely lies in the implementation of the total degree case where the logic for filtering out monomials based on total degree may be faulty. Specifically, the generation of monomials using `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` functions followed by a check on `powers.values()` does not seem to account correctly for all possible combinations of monomial degrees that could meet the total degree criteria, especially when `max_degree` equals `min_degree`.",
