The provided code snippet demonstrates that while the function should return monomials with a total degree equal to `min_degrees`, it only returns monomials composed of a single variable raised to the `min_degrees` power. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior described in the documentation, which might lead to erroneous results in mathematical computations. The search results contain the source code of the `itermonomials` function. After examining the function's implementation (span id='itermonomials'), it's clear that the function's logic incorrectly considers `min_degree` as a threshold rather than as a lower bound for the total degree of the monomials. This oversight leads to the missing monomials that should have degrees equal to `min_degrees` but are composed of multiple variables, as illustrated in the example. Therefore, the relevant code spans are within the implementation of `itermonomials`.",
