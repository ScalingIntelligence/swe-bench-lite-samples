The example provided shows that when both `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are set to 3, the function should return monomials of total degree 3, including those like `x1*x2**2`, but it does not. Upon reviewing the code span for `itermonomials`, it is clear that the function is only generating monomials that exactly match the degree without considering combinations that sum up to the degree, which leads to the reported issue. The function uses combinations_with_replacement, which may not account for all possible combinations that sum up to the degree specified. This analysis points to the need for a more comprehensive generation of monomials to ensure that all combinations of variables that satisfy the degree constraints are considered.",

The function's logic seems to handle both total degree and individual degree constraints. It uses combinations and products to generate monomials, filtering them based on the degree constraints. The issue states that certain monomials are missing when using the `min_degrees` argument, suggesting a potential flaw in the filtering logic. Upon inspection, especially in the `total_degree` section where the function checks `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree`, it appears that the function might not be correctly handling the inclusion of all monomials within the degree range. This segment could be the focus for further analysis and fixing the issue. The presence of the function and the direct references to degree constraints in the context leads me to conclude that the relevant code for addressing the issue is identified.",

This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
