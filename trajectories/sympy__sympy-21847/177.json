According to the provided example and documentation, the function should return all monomials with a total degree between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`, inclusive. However, the current output only includes monomials of exact degree `max_degrees` and misses those with mixed degrees that still sum up to the specified `min_degrees` or `max_degrees`. This discrepancy warrants a detailed investigation into the implementation of `itermonomials` in `sympy/polys/monomials.py` and its related functions. Additionally, since the function involves the generation and handling of monomials, it's reasonable to also check the `sympy/polys/orderings.py` file for any ordering or sorting logic that might inadvertently filter out the required monomials.",

This suggests a problem in how the function is handling the condition for the minimum degree of monomials.\n\nFrom the provided context, the `itermonomials` function is defined in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`. The function appears to handle generation of monomials based on whether `total_degree` is True or False. When `total_degree` is True (which is the case when a single degree is provided as opposed to a list of degrees), the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` or `product` from `itertools` to generate monomials. However, it checks the condition for inclusion in the monomial list using `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree`, which only checks if the highest individual power in the monomial is at least `min_degree`, not the total degree of the monomial.\n\nThis might be the root cause of the issue, where the function does not correctly apply the `min_degrees` check across all scenarios, particularly in ensuring that monomials have at least the specified total degree. This analysis is supported by the demonstration of missing monomials with a total degree of 3 when `min_degrees` is set to 3, as described in the issue.\n\nThe search results provided include the `monomial_key` function from `sympy/polys/orderings.py`, and the `itermonomials` function from `sympy/polys/monomials.py`. However, the `monomial_key` function is not directly related to the `min_degrees` issue and is instead used for sorting monomials according to the specified order.\n\nGiven these observations, the task is to identify the code span in `sympy/polys/monomials.py` that handles the generation and filtering of monomials based on `min_degrees`, since this is where the problem lies.",
