Specifically, the example provided indicates that monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` are missing, even though they should have a total degree of 3. The problem seems to be centered around the handling of the `min_degrees` argument within the `itermonomials` function. Upon examining the code span labeled 'itermonomials', it appears that the function might not be correctly filtering out or including monomials based on the `min_degree` when `total_degree` is True. This is evident from the usage of `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree`, which might not capture all valid combinations of monomials that meet the `min_degree` criteria. Therefore, the identified code span is highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
