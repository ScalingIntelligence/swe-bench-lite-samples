Since the `itermonomials` function is defined in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file, that is the primary file to investigate. Additionally, since the issue involves monomial generation and ordering, it might be relevant to look at the `MonomialOrder` class and related functions in `sympy/polys/orderings.py`.",

Additionally, the `monomial_key` function in `sympy/polys/orderings.py` is relevant, as it is used to sort the generated monomials in the example provided. Based on the reported issue, two code spans are identified: the main body of the `itermonomials` function, which is responsible for generating monomials with specified degree constraints, and the `monomial_key` function used for specifying the monomial ordering in the example.",

This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
