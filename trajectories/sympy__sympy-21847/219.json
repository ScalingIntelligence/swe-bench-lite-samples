Specifically, the function does not include monomials with total degree equal to `min_degrees` that should be included according to the documentation. The provided code snippet in the search results contains the implementation of the `itermonomials` function. The function has two different paths depending on whether `max_degrees` is a sequence or a single value. In the case where `total_degree` is True, the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` to generate monomials. However, the check for `min_degree` is incorrect, as it only checks if the maximum power is greater than or equal to `min_degree`, whereas it should check if the total degree of each monomial is within the specified range. This issue is likely the cause of the bug reported. Therefore, this span of code is highly relevant to the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "itermonomials returns incorrect monomials when using min_degrees argument\n`itermonomials` returns incorrect monomials when using optional `min_degrees` argument\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code introduces three symbolic variables and generates monomials with max and min degree of 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sympy as sp\r\nfrom sympy.polys.orderings import monomial_key\r\n\r\nx1, x2, x3 = sp.symbols('x1, x2, x3')\r\nstates = [x1, x2, x3]\r\nmax_degrees = 3\r\nmin_degrees = 3\r\nmonomials = sorted(sp.itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees), \r\n                   key=monomial_key('grlex', states))\r\nprint(monomials)\r\n```\r\nThe code returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`, when it _should_ also return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that also have total degree of 3. This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
