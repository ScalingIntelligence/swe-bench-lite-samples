Specifically, it is mentioned that the function should return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that have a total degree of 3, but it is not doing so. This discrepancy is highlighted with an example using symbolic variables and the `itermonomials` function from the SymPy library. The provided search result contains the implementation of the `itermonomials` function. The function logic is divided into two parts based on whether the total degree or individual degrees are specified. The part handling the total degree case does not correctly filter monomials based on the `min_degree` parameter. This part of the code is likely the source of the issue as it does not ensure that monomials with a total degree equal to `min_degree` are included. Therefore, the relevant code span to address this issue is the one identified as 'itermonomials', which contains the implementation of the `itermonomials` function.",

The checks for `min_degree` are applied but do not ensure that all combinations of monomials that meet the degree criteria are generated. Additionally, helper functions or other modules that could affect monomial generation are worth investigating.

When `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are set to the same value, the function fails to return all possible monomials of that degree. Instead, it only returns monomials with each variable raised to the specified degree, missing the combinatorial possibilities like `x1*x2**2`.\n\nThe provided search results contain the source code for the `itermonomials` function, including the validation and computation logic involving `min_degrees`. This code is crucial for addressing the issue because it directly involves the generation and verification of monomials based on the `min_degrees` parameter. Reviewing this section of the code will help in understanding and possibly correcting why certain monomials (like mixed powers) are not being generated. Additionally, other functions related to degree determination, such as `degree`, `total_degree`, and `degree_list`, are found in `polytools.py`, which might be indirectly affected or require adjustments in conjunction with fixes in `itermonomials`, especially if they influence how monomials are interpreted or generated.\n\nRegarding the search task completeness, while the primary issue lies within the `itermonomials` function's implementation, related functions like `total_degree` in `polytools.py` are pertinent since they could influence the degree calculations used in `itermonomials`. Checking these secondary functions ensures a comprehensive understanding and solution for the reported issue.",
