The issue is that when the `min_degrees` argument is used, the function does not return all expected monomials with the specified total degree. I examined the provided code snippet labeled with the span id 'itermonomials'. The logic within this function appears to be the one responsible for generating monomials based on the provided variables, max degrees, and optionally min degrees. The specific part of the code responsible for handling the total degree scenario is where combinations_with_replacement or product are used, but it only appends monomials to the list if the maximum power in the current combination is at least the min_degree, which seems to be the issue.\n\nBased on the context and the detailed description of the issue, I identified the relevant span in the search results that mirrors the described problem. This span encapsulates the function's logic directly involved in the monomial generation process and is thus the most relevant part of the code for addressing the issue.",
