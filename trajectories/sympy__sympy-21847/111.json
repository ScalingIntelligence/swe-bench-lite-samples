According to the provided example and the expected behavior from the documentation, the function should return monomials with a total degree of 3 that include combinations of the variables (e.g., `x1*x2**2`). However, it only returns monomials with a single variable raised to the third power. This suggests a potential bug in the `itermonomials` function itself or in how it processes the `min_degrees` argument. To address this, I should focus the search on the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file, where the `itermonomials` function is defined, and ensure that I'm looking for the correct behavior and any indications of where the logic might be failing to consider combinations of variables for the specified minimum degree.",

The provided code snippet demonstrates that the function neglects to include some monomials that fit the criteria of having a total degree equal to 3, as specified by both `max_degrees` and `min_degrees`. Upon analyzing the `<search_results>`, it's evident that the function `itermonomials` in `sympy/polys/monomials.py` is directly related to the issue. The function processes the `variables`, `max_degrees`, and optionally `min_degrees` to generate monomials. The logic inside the function appears to differ depending on whether the degree specified is a 'total degree' or not. For 'total degree', the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and checks if the maximum power in the generated monomial is greater than or equal to `min_degree`. This part of the code might be where the error lies since it is not considering monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2`, which should be included according to the documentation. Therefore, the attention should be focused on this code span.",
