The function is expected to generate all monomials with degrees between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`, but it fails to include certain monomials that should be present with a total degree of 3. This discrepancy indicates a potential bug within the `itermonomials` function. By examining the provided search results, the function `itermonomials` is found to handle the generation of monomials based on the given maximum and minimum degrees. The function sets up conditions for whether the degrees refer to a total degree or individual degrees for each variable. It then proceeds to generate monomials using combinations or products of the variables. However, upon closer inspection, there seems to be a logical issue in the condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree`, which likely causes the function to overlook certain valid monomials. This could be the root cause of the reported problem. Therefore, the relevant code span that needs to be addressed is within the `itermonomials` function.",

This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
