Specifically, the function is not returning monomials that should be included according to the total degree constraint described in the documentation. The relevant code span is found in the `itermonomials` function definition within the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. This function is responsible for generating monomials based on the specified maximum and minimum degrees. The provided implementation checks for the total degree constraint but seems to miss the inclusion of monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2` that have a total degree of 3 but are not purely single variable monomials. By analyzing the code, it appears that the current implementation might not be correctly handling the combination of different variables to meet the total degree requirement when `min_degree` is set. Therefore, the identified code span directly relates to the reported issue as it pertains to the malfunctioning of the `itermonomials` function when using the `min_degrees` parameter.",
