The function logic needs to be inspected for any issues related to the handling of the `min_degrees` argument.\n\nThe relevant part of the function is where it handles the `total_degree` condition and specifically how it processes the `min_degree`. The logic currently checks if the maximum power in the monomial is greater than or equal to `min_degree`, which seems incorrect because it should check the total degree of the monomial instead.

The expected behavior is that all monomials with a total degree between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` should be returned. The provided example shows that monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2` are missing. The code analysis of the `itermonomials` function reveals that when `total_degree` is True, the function uses combinations_with_replacement and product to generate monomials, but it only checks if the maximum power of the variables is greater than or equal to `min_degree`. This implies that the function might not correctly handle the case where the total degree matches `min_degree` but involves combinations of different variables. This is likely the root cause of the issue. Identifying and fixing this part of the code should resolve the reported problem.",
