This function is expected to generate all monomials such that the total degree of each monomial is between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`. However, monomials like 'x1*x2**2' or 'x2*x3**2' are missing, which should have a total degree of 3. Based on the provided context, the function `itermonomials` is located in 'sympy/polys/monomials.py'. Additionally, related functions and classes like `monomial_key`, `MonomialOrder`, `LexOrder`, and `ReversedGradedLexOrder` might also be relevant as they deal with monomial orderings and can influence the generation or sorting of monomials. Moreover, functions dealing with monomial calculations such as `monomial_count`, `monomial_max`, and `monomial_min` in 'sympy/polys/monomials.py' could be key to understanding the problem.",

This function is central to the issue reported, as it deals with the generation of monomials based on specified maximum and minimum degrees. The function's logic attempts to generate monomials by either considering the total degree or handling each variable's degree separately based on the input types. However, the logic that filters out monomials based on the total degree in the `total_degree` block seems to have a potential flaw. The condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` inside the generator blocks is likely where issues arise regarding the inclusion of valid monomials like 'x1*x2**2' or 'x2*x3**2'. This suggests there might be an error in how the minimum degree constraint is being applied, leading to missing monomials that should have been included.
