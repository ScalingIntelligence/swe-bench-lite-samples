The provided example code demonstrates that monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` are missing from the output, despite having total degree of 3, which should match the specified `min_degrees`. The relevant code span is in the `itermonomials` function definition, which handles the generation of monomials based on the provided `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` arguments. The critical part of the code involves the logic inside the `if total_degree:` block, which is responsible for generating monomials with a total degree constraint. This section needs to be reviewed and potentially corrected to ensure it includes all monomials that meet the total degree criteria, especially those with mixed degrees. Additionally, the issue mentions that the problem persists when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`, suggesting a more general problem in how degrees are handled in the function.",

  "initial_message": "itermonomials returns incorrect monomials when using min_degrees argument\n`itermonomials` returns incorrect monomials when using optional `min_degrees` argument\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code introduces three symbolic variables and generates monomials with max and min degree of 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sympy as sp\r\nfrom sympy.polys.orderings import monomial_key\r\n\r\nx1, x2, x3 = sp.symbols('x1, x2, x3')\r\nstates = [x1, x2, x3]\r\nmax_degrees = 3\r\nmin_degrees = 3\r\nmonomials = sorted(sp.itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees), \r\n                   key=monomial_key('grlex', states))\r\nprint(monomials)\r\n```\r\nThe code returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`, when it _should_ also return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that also have total degree of 3. This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
