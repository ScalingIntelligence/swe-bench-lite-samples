The expected behavior is that the function should generate all monomials with total degree between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`. The provided code snippet in the search results shows the implementation of the `itermonomials` function. It is clear from the function's logic that there is a misunderstanding in the use of the `min_degrees` argument. Specifically, the condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` suggests that it only includes monomials where the highest individual degree is greater than or equal to `min_degree`, rather than ensuring the total degree of the monomial meets this criteria. This discrepancy is likely the root cause of the reported issue. To fix this, the function should be modified to calculate the total degree of each monomial and compare it to `min_degree`. Therefore, the relevant code span identified is the entire `itermonomials` function.",

This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
