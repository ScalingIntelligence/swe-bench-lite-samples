However, it seems to be missing some of these monomials, such as those of the form `x1*x2**2` or `x2*x3**2` when `min_degrees` is set to 3. This discrepancy suggests a potential bug in the `itermonomials` implementation. I need to identify the relevant code span that handles the generation of monomials with the `min_degrees` argument to determine if it's correctly implemented. The provided search results include the `itermonomials` function code span. Analyzing this span should be sufficient to understand the issue since it directly relates to the functionality in question. Other code spans, such as those in `orderings.py`, might be useful for context but do not directly address the issue described.
