This function is expected to yield all monomials with degrees between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` as per the documentation. A detailed look into the function's logic in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file is necessary to diagnose why it fails to include monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2` which should be included based on their total degree of 3. Additionally, the behavior persists even when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`. This suggests an error in the logic that governs the inclusion of monomials based on degree constraints.",

The function is expected to generate all monomials with degrees between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`, but it fails to include some monomials with the specified total degree. Upon analyzing the provided code span related to `itermonomials`, it appears that the function has a logical structure designed to handle both total degree and individual degree constraints. The issue seems to be centered around the condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:`, which is used to filter monomials. This condition might be too restrictive, especially when `min_degree` is specified. It does not account for combinations of degrees that sum to the specified `min_degree`, which could explain the missing monomials. This understanding aligns with the reported issue, suggesting that the current implementation might be missing the combinations of individual degrees that sum up to the required total degree.",
