The expected behavior is that monomials of total degree equal to the specified `min_degrees` (and less than or equal to `max_degrees`) should be included in the output. However, the current implementation only includes monomials where each variable's degree is at least `min_degree`, which does not align with the documented behavior. This discrepancy is evident in the provided code span within the `itermonomials` function, specifically where the `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` functions are used to generate monomials. The condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` incorrectly filters out monomials that should be included based on the total degree. Therefore, the relevant code span that needs to be addressed is the logic within the `itermonomials` function that handles the generation and filtering of monomials.
