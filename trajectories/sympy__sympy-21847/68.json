Specifically, when using `min_degrees=3` with `max_degrees=3` for three symbolic variables, the function fails to generate all monomials of total degree 3. The expectation, as stated in the documentation, is that all monomials satisfying `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree` should be included. Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the function correctly processes the `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` arguments. However, the logic for generating monomials seems to incorrectly filter out non-singular degree monomials and may not handle the cross-multiplication of variables adequately. This is evident in the conditional statement `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree`, which might be designed to filter monomials by their highest individual degree, rather than their total degree. This misinterpretation of the `min_degrees` parameter could explain the absence of certain monomials, leading to the reported issue.",

The issue specifically addresses the incorrect handling of the `min_degrees` argument, which is causing certain monomials to be missed. The code in the `itermonomials` function shows how it processes both `max_degrees` and `min_degrees`. Notably, the function treats the `min_degree` condition differently depending on whether it's processing individual variable degrees or a total degree. This suggests that the fault might lie in how the total degree is being checked against the `min_degree`. Given that the file context provided is limited to 'monomials.py', and considering the complexity of the function, it's likely that all relevant parts of the code needed to understand and potentially fix the issue are included.

  "initial_message": "itermonomials returns incorrect monomials when using min_degrees argument\n`itermonomials` returns incorrect monomials when using optional `min_degrees` argument\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code introduces three symbolic variables and generates monomials with max and min degree of 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sympy as sp\r\nfrom sympy.polys.orderings import monomial_key\r\n\r\nx1, x2, x3 = sp.symbols('x1, x2, x3')\r\nstates = [x1, x2, x3]\r\nmax_degrees = 3\r\nmin_degrees = 3\r\nmonomials = sorted(sp.itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees), \r\n                   key=monomial_key('grlex', states))\r\nprint(monomials)\r\n```\r\nThe code returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`, when it _should_ also return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that also have total degree of 3. This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
