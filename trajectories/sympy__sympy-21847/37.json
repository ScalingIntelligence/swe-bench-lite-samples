The issue states that the function fails to include monomials with total degree equal to `min_degrees`, which should be present according to the documentation. This indicates a potential problem with the logic in the function where it checks for `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` rather than ensuring the total degree of monomials matches the `min_degree` requirement.
