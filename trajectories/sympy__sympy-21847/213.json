There are two separate code paths: one for commutative variables and one for non-commutative variables. The check `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` might be too restrictive, as it might ignore combinations of monomials with different degrees that sum up correctly to the total degree.

  "initial_message": "itermonomials returns incorrect monomials when using min_degrees argument\n`itermonomials` returns incorrect monomials when using optional `min_degrees` argument\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code introduces three symbolic variables and generates monomials with max and min degree of 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sympy as sp\r\nfrom sympy.polys.orderings import monomial_key\r\n\r\nx1, x2, x3 = sp.symbols('x1, x2, x3')\r\nstates = [x1, x2, x3]\r\nmax_degrees = 3\r\nmin_degrees = 3\r\nmonomials = sorted(sp.itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees), \r\n                   key=monomial_key('grlex', states))\r\nprint(monomials)\r\n```\r\nThe code returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`, when it _should_ also return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that also have total degree of 3. This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
