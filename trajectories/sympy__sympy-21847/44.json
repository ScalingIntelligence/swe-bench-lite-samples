The provided code snippet and search results highlight the relevant part of the code that handles the generation of monomials with specified min and max degrees. \n\nUpon examining the `itermonomials` code span, it appears that the function is designed to generate monomials within a specified degree range. However, the logic for handling total degree versus individual degrees is a bit convoluted. Specifically, the handling of `min_degree` in the context of total degree appears to be incorrect. This might be the reason why only purely powered monomials are being generated when `min_degrees` equals `max_degrees`. There doesn't seem to be logic that allows for the generation of mixed-powers monomials (like x1*x2**2) within the specified total degree. \n\nRegarding the other spans in `orderings.py`, the `monomial_key` function and related order definitions are used for ordering monomials and aren't directly related to the generation issue described. \n\nGiven the analysis, the main issue seems to be within the `itermonomials` function. It requires a detailed check and possible correction for handling `min_degrees` in conjunction with `max_degrees` when `total_degree` is True.",

            "scratch_pad": "The issue pertains to the incorrect handling of the `min_degrees` parameter in the `itermonomials` function. The current implementation checks the `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree`, which is incorrect because it should check the total degree of the monomial against the `min_degree` rather than the maximum power of any single variable. This is likely causing the function to omit some monomials that should meet the specified minimum degree criteria. The fix involves adjusting the condition to ensure that the total degree of each monomial is checked against `min_degree`.",
