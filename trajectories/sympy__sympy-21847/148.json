This behavior is not consistent with the documentation, which states that a generator of all monomials `monom` should be returned such that `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`. The provided code span for `itermonomials` indicates that the function can either operate with a single total degree or with individual degrees for each variable. The logic inside the function seems to correctly handle the total degree case by iterating through combinations and products of the variables, but it may have a flaw when filtering monomials based on the `min_degree`.
