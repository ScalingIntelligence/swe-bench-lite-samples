The example provided demonstrates that monomials of total degree 3, which include combinations like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2`, are missing when `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are both set to 3. This behavior contradicts the documented expectation that all monomials meeting the degree criteria should be generated.\n\nReviewing the source code in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`, the function `itermonomials` is found, which matches the function used in the example. The relevant section handles the generation of monomials based on the `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` parameters. The logic seems focused on generating monomials either by considering total degree only or by verifying individual variable degrees. The issue likely arises from incorrect handling of the total degree check when `min_degrees` is specified, missing potentially valid combinations of monomials.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant code span seems to be within the `itermonomials` function definition, where the total degree logic is implemented. This section must be inspected closely to identify any flaws or missed conditions in checking the criteria for monomial inclusion.",
