Specifically, monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2`, etc., that have a total degree of 3 are missing. The issue suggests that this behavior is inconsistent with the function's documentation, which promises that all monomials with a total degree between `min_degree` and `max_degree` will be included. The provided code span containing the `itermonomials` function reveals a section that handles the total degree case. In this part of the code, the function generates monomials based on combinations and products of the input variables, but it appears to be filtering based solely on the maximum power of any single variable rather than the total degree of all variables combined. This discrepancy could be the cause of the missing monomials. Therefore, the relevant code span to address this issue would be the block of code inside the `total_degree` conditional. Additionally, the function should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly calculates and checks the total degree of the generated monomials.",

  "initial_message": "itermonomials returns incorrect monomials when using min_degrees argument\n`itermonomials` returns incorrect monomials when using optional `min_degrees` argument\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code introduces three symbolic variables and generates monomials with max and min degree of 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sympy as sp\r\nfrom sympy.polys.orderings import monomial_key\r\n\r\nx1, x2, x3 = sp.symbols('x1, x2, x3')\r\nstates = [x1, x2, x3]\r\nmax_degrees = 3\r\nmin_degrees = 3\r\nmonomials = sorted(sp.itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees), \r\n                   key=monomial_key('grlex', states))\r\nprint(monomials)\r\n```\r\nThe code returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`, when it _should_ also return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that also have total degree of 3. This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
