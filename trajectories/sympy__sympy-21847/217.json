This function is responsible for generating monomials based on given variables, maximum degrees, and optionally minimum degrees. The issue seems to be that the current implementation of `itermonomials` does not fully consider the minimum degree when generating monomials that include combinations of variables. The logic to check and include monomials based on the minimum degree threshold appears to be flawed or incomplete.

The issue suggests that the function does not correctly handle the `min_degrees` argument, and the code in the file context confirms this. It appears that the function only considers individual variable degrees and not the cumulative degree when `min_degrees` is specified. This explains the missing monomials of the total degree 3, as described in the issue.
