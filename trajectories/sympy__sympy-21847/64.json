The example provided shows that the function is not generating all monomials of total degree 3 when `min_degrees` is set to 3. The function should generate all monomials that satisfy `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`, as stated in the documentation. The focus should be on the `itermonomials` function in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. Specifically, the section dealing with the generation of monomials when `total_degree` is `True` and handling the `min_degree` parameter needs to be examined. The provided code span shows this function, which already includes checks and loops for generating monomials based on the `min_degree` and `max_degree` parameters. However, the issue might be related to how the total degree of the monomials is being checked and generated. By examining the code, it appears that the condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` might not be sufficient to capture all valid combinations of monomials, particularly those with mixed powers like `x1*x2**2`. This needs further investigation to ensure all valid monomials are included.",

This approach may exclude valid monomials where the sum of the powers is within the range but none of the individual powers meet this condition. The code does not currently handle the case where the sum of the powers should be checked against `min_degree` and `max_degree`, which is necessary to include all valid monomials.

This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
