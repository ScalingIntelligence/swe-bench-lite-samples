Specifically, it fails to include monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` which have a total degree of 3. The expected behavior is described in the documentation, which states that a generator of all monomials `monom` should be returned such that `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`. Upon reviewing the code in `itermonomials` in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`, it is clear that the function does not correctly handle the `min_degrees` argument, especially in the logic where it checks if the sum of the degrees of the monomials meets the `min_degree` requirement. This is evident in the use of `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` instead of ensuring the sum of the exponents meets the minimum degree requirement. Given this understanding, the identified code span is directly related to the reported issue.",

This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
