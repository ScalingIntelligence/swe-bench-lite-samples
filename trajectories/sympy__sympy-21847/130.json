The function currently uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` from the `itertools` module for generating monomials. However, it might not be correctly filtering or generating monomials based on the total degree when the `min_degrees` parameter is involved. Specifically, the condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` suggests an attempt to filter monomials by total degree, but it seems flawed as it checks the maximum power in the monomial set instead of verifying the total degree across all powers.
