            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue revolves around the `itermonomials` function from SymPy, which is meant to generate monomials within specified degree ranges. The user observes that the function does not return all expected monomials when using the `min_degrees` argument. This discrepancy between the observed behavior and the documented expectation suggests a potential flaw in the function's implementation.\n\nUpon examining the `itermonomials` function in the provided search results, it's clear that this function handles the generation of monomials with different strategies based on whether the total degree or individual degrees are specified. In the case of total degree specification, the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` from `itertools` to generate possible monomials and filters them based on the `min_degree` and `max_degree`.\n\nThe key section of the function where the monomials are generated and filtered according to the total degree is particularly relevant to the reported issue, as it directly addresses the specific case where only monomials with the exact total degree mentioned should be considered. The user's example indicates that not all monomials satisfying the total degree condition are produced, suggesting a potential oversight or bug in the condition checking logic within the total degree block of the function.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it is crucial to focus on the implementation details within the total degree handling block to identify if the condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` correctly captures all monomials within the specified degree range, especially when `min_degree` is equal to `max_degree`.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the `itermonomials` function definition in the provided search results is directly relevant to addressing the user's issue, and understanding or modifying the logic in this section could resolve the problem.",

  "initial_message": "itermonomials returns incorrect monomials when using min_degrees argument\n`itermonomials` returns incorrect monomials when using optional `min_degrees` argument\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code introduces three symbolic variables and generates monomials with max and min degree of 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport sympy as sp\r\nfrom sympy.polys.orderings import monomial_key\r\n\r\nx1, x2, x3 = sp.symbols('x1, x2, x3')\r\nstates = [x1, x2, x3]\r\nmax_degrees = 3\r\nmin_degrees = 3\r\nmonomials = sorted(sp.itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees), \r\n                   key=monomial_key('grlex', states))\r\nprint(monomials)\r\n```\r\nThe code returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`, when it _should_ also return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that also have total degree of 3. This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
