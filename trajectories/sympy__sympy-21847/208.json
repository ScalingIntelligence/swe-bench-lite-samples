This logic might be missing the generation of mixed degree monomials that sum to `min_degree`. For instance, when `max_degree` is 3 and `min_degree` is 3, the function should also yield monomials like `x1*x2**2`, but it currently does not.

Instead, it only returns monomials with a single variable raised to the power of 3. The expected behavior is that it should also return monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2`, etc., which have a total degree of 3. The relevant code span to address this issue is the implementation of the `itermonomials` function in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. This function generates monomials and checks if they meet the min and max degree criteria. The part of the code that checks the total degree and adds monomials to the list seems to be incorrect or incomplete. Specifically, the conditions and loops generating the monomials need to be reviewed and possibly updated to ensure that all monomials meeting the degree criteria are included.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue indicates that the `itermonomials` function in `sympy/polys/monomials.py` is not correctly generating all monomials when the `min_degrees` argument is used. Specifically, it fails to include monomials that should have a total degree between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`. This suggests that there might be an error in the logic that filters or generates monomials based on these degree constraints. The provided code span contains the entire `itermonomials` function, which is relevant to the reported issue as it directly implements the functionality in question. Analyzing this code is crucial to understand how the function processes the `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` arguments and how it generates and filters monomials. The function's structure indicates that it separates the handling based on whether `total_degree` is True or False, which is determined by the format of the `max_degrees` argument. Given the issue, the focus should be on the section where `total_degree` is True, as this is the section most likely to have an error when using the `min_degrees` argument. This section includes a loop that generates monomials using combinations or products of the variables and then filters them based on their degrees. The condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` in both the commutative and non-commutative cases might be the source of the issue, as it might filter out monomials that should be included if their total degree meets the `min_degree` requirement but their individual variable powers distribution does not. Examining this specific part of the code is critical to understanding and fixing the issue.",
