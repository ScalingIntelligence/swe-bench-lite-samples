This suggests a potential bug in the function's logic, particularly in how it handles the generation of monomials with a specified total degree. The search results show the implementation of the `itermonomials` function within the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. I analyzed the code but will require more context on how the function is failing specifically due to min_degree constraints. However, since this is the primary function associated with the issue, it is crucial to investigate it further.

The function uses combinations_with_replacement and product to generate monomials, but it lacks a check for the total degree being exactly equal to `min_degree` when `total_degree` is True.

The provided example demonstrates that the function misses certain monomials that should be included when the total degree is equal to `min_degrees`.\n\nUpon examining the implementation of `itermonomials` in the given search results, it becomes clear that the function is designed to handle two different cases: one where a total degree is specified (`total_degree = True`) and another where individual variable degrees are specified (`total_degree = False`).\n\nIn the `total_degree = True` case, which is the relevant scenario for the reported issue, the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` from `itertools` to generate monomials. The critical logic lies in the condition that checks if the maximum power of any variable exceeds `min_degree`. This is likely where the issue arises, as it might not correctly filter out monomials that meet the exact `min_degree` requirement.\n\nThe provided search results include the relevant implementation of `itermonomials`, which is enough to understand and potentially fix the issue.
