Specifically, monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2` are not included when the `min_degrees` is set to 3, even though their total degree is 3. Reviewing the code in `monomials.py`, there is a relevant function `itermonomials` that processes the generation of monomials based on the provided degrees. The function uses `combinations_with_replacement` for commutative variables and `product` for non-commutative variables. The logic to check if the total degree of the monomial meets the `min_degree` requirement is in place, but it appears that the issue might be with how the loop constructs the monomials list. Given the context, this function needs to be examined further to ensure it correctly handles all combinatorial possibilities within the degree constraints.",

For `total_degree=True` (when a single max_degree is provided and no min_degrees list is given), the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` to generate monomials. It checks if the maximum power of any variable in a generated monomial meets the `min_degree` condition. This logic appears to be responsible for the issue described in the issue, as it does not correctly account for all monomials that meet the total degree requirement. The function in its current state would miss monomials such as `x1*x2**2` because it only checks the maximum power of any single variable, not the total degree of the monomial. The issue is consistent with the problem described in the reported issue.

This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
