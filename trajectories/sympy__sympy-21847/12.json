The provided search results contain the implementation of the `itermonomials` function within the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. This function is responsible for generating monomials based on specified variables and degree limits. The analysis of the code reveals that there is a discrepancy in the conditional checks and the combinations logic used when `total_degree` is True. Specifically, the current implementation does not correctly consider combinations that meet the minimum degree requirement when variables are commutative. This likely explains why the expected monomials like `x1*x2**2`, `x2*x3**2`, etc., are not being included in the output. Therefore, the identified span from the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file, particularly the `itermonomials` function and its handling of the `min_degrees` parameter, is highly relevant to the reported issue.",
