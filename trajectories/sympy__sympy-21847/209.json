The user provided an example demonstrating the incorrect behavior, showing that some monomials with total degree of 3 are missing. The current file context already provides the code for the `itermonomials` function, specifically handling the case where a single `max_degree` is provided (indicating total degree mode). The search results exactly match the already provided file context, indicating no new information is available to further investigate the issue. The critical part of the code to examine is the block responsible for generating monomials in total degree mode, where it checks if the maximum power in the monomial is greater than or equal to `min_degree`. The logic in this part of the code should be reviewed to ensure it correctly includes all permutations of variables that sum to the specified total degree (ranging from `min_degree` to `max_degree`). Given the information available, focusing on the `itermonomials` function in the provided code is sufficient to address the reported issue. Enhancements or fixes might involve adjustments in the loop and condition checking within the total degree mode to ensure all expected monomials are generated.",
