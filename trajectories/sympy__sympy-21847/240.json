This suggests a potential bug or incomplete implementation in the `itermonomials` function itself or possibly in related functions or classes that help generate the monomials. Given the context, the most likely source of the problem is in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file where the `itermonomials` function is defined. However, it might also be useful to check other files like `sympy/polys/polyclasses.py` and `sympy/polys/rings.py` that might interact with or rely on the monomials generation logic.",

The condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` is used to determine if a monomial should be included, which is too restrictive and does not take into account the total degree of the monomial.
