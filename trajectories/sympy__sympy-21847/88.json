The search results contain the code for the `itermonomials` function in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`, which closely aligns with the issue reported. The function definition includes logic to handle both total degree and individual degrees, but it seems to miss generating some monomials when `min_degrees` is specified. The relevant code section within the `itermonomials` function is the logic related to handling `total degree` and parsing the `variables` along with `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` to yield monomials. This section should be carefully reviewed to identify why monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` are not being generated when `min_degrees` is used.",

This oversight causes the function to miss monomials that meet the total degree requirement but don't have an individual power that meets the `min_degree` check.

Specifically, it mentions that when using the `min_degrees` argument, the function does not return all expected monomials. The example provided shows that monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` are missing even when the total degree matches the specified `min_degrees`. This behavior is inconsistent with the documentation, which states that all monomials with a total degree satisfying `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree` should be generated. The primary focus is on the `itermonomials` function within the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. Reviewing the code in the `itermonomials` function, it appears that the issue lies in how the function constructs and filters the monomials when `total_degree` is True and the `min_degrees` argument is used. The function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` from `itertools`, and the filtering condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` seems to be overly restrictive and might be causing the missing monomials.",
