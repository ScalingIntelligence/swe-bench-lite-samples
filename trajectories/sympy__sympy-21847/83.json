The user's example reveals that the function does not return monomials that have a total degree of 3 but involve combinations of multiple variables, as expected according to the documentation. This suggests that the function might not be correctly handling the `min_degrees` argument to ensure it includes all monomials within the specified degree range.\n\nThe provided search results contain the code for the `itermonomials` function. The function is complex, handling both total degree and degree per variable cases, and includes checks and conditions for input validity. The core logic of generating monomials based on the degrees is in the two major branches that handle commutative and non-commutative variables separately. For commutative variables, the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and for non-commutative, it uses `product` from `itertools`, but in both cases, the check for minimum degree is applied after constructing the monomial. This may be the point where the issue lies; the minimum degree check could potentially exclude valid monomials.\n\nGiven this understanding, the relevant code span is identified within the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file, specifically focusing on the implementation of `itermonomials` where the generation and filtering of monomials occur.",
