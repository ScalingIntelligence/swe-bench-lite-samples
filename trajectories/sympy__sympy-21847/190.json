The function is expected to generate all monomials that have a total degree between `min_degree` and `max_degree`, inclusive. However, the function is not returning monomials with total degree equal to `min_degree` that are products of multiple variables (e.g., `x1*x2**2`). The provided code snippet includes the `itermonomials` function, which demonstrates the generation of monomials based on the given `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` arguments. The key part of the function lies in the section that handles monomials with a total degree, where it is necessary to ensure that all monomials with degrees within the specified range are included. Given the relevance of the function to the reported issue and the need to review its logic, it is advisable to identify and further examine the `itermonomials` function within the search results.",
