The example provided demonstrates that monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2` are missing, which should have a total degree of 3. The search results include the implementation of `itermonomials` in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. This code handles the generation of monomials based on the `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` parameters. The function uses different logic based on whether `total_degree` is True or False. When `total_degree` is True, it uses combinations_with_replacement to generate monomials, and it checks if the maximum power in the monomial is greater than or equal to `min_degree`. This logic is likely where the issue arises, as it only checks the maximum power rather than ensuring the total degree condition is met. Therefore, the relevant code span is the implementation of `itermonomials` that handles the total degree case, specifically where it generates and filters monomials with the `min_degree` constraint.",
