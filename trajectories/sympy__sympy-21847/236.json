The function is supposed to generate monomials with total degrees between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`, but the observed behavior is inconsistent with this requirement, as it omits certain expected monomials. Therefore, the focus should be on the `itermonomials` function and its implementation in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. Additionally, since the issue involves understanding the ordering of monomials, the relevant parts of `sympy/polys/orderings.py` should also be inspected.",
