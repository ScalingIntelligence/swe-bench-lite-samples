The provided search results include the source code of `itermonomials` function within `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. The function definition and the logic used to generate monomials are present in the code span with id 'itermonomials'. This code span appears to be directly related to the issue, as it deals with the generation of monomials based on the `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` parameters. Other code spans in different files seem unrelated to the specific issue at hand, as they involve different functionalities related to monomial ordering and product order building.
