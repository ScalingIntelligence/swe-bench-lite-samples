The provided file context shows the `itermonomials` function defined in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`, so this is definitely a key file to investigate. It might be necessary to look deeper into the logic of how monomials are generated within that function, particularly where the `min_degrees` parameter is handled.

This discrepancy is inconsistent with the documentation, which states that all monomials with a total degree between `min_degree` and `max_degree` should be generated. The provided code snippet from `sympy/polys/monomials.py` contains the implementation of the `itermonomials` function. Analyzing this function, I notice that it uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` to generate monomials, but there is a condition to check `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree`. This condition might not correctly capture the requirement for all terms with a total degree of at least `min_degree`.

If `max_degrees` is a single number, it generates combinations of variables with total degree up to `max_degree` and filters out those whose highest individual degree is below `min_degree`. However, the logic for the total degree case (when `total_degree` is True) appears to incorrectly filter out monomials that should be included if they meet the total degree criteria but do not individually meet the `min_degree` criteria for each variable. This might explain why monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2` are missing, as they have the correct total degree but not all variables individually meet the `min_degree` criterion.

The problem seems to be in the logic of the function when handling total degree cases with the `min_degrees` parameter. The code span provided in the search results is exactly the `itermonomials` function definition from the `sympy` library, which suggests that the issue arises from the implementation of this function specifically.
