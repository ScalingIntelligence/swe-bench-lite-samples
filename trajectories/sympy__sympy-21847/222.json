The provided code defines the `itermonomials` function in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. The function should generate all monomials such that `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`. However, the example provided shows that it fails to generate monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2`, which have a total degree of 3. This discrepancy suggests that the logic within the function may not correctly handle the `min_degrees` parameter for total_degree cases, focusing erroneously on the highest degree term instead of considering all degree combinations. The task is to find and extract the relevant code span within `itermonomials` that deals with generating monomials within the specified degree range, as it is the most pertinent to addressing the reported issue.",
