The example provided shows that monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` are missing when `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are set to 3. This behavior is inconsistent with the function's documentation, which states that all monomials with degrees between `min_degree` and `max_degree` should be returned. The relevant code span to investigate is the `itermonomials` function in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`. The function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` to generate monomials, but it seems to have a logic error when filtering out monomials based on the `min_degree` criteria. Specifically, the condition `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` might need to be adjusted to include all monomials that meet the degree requirements.",
