Given the context from the provided files, it's clear that the `itermonomials` function is in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`, and the documentation appears to be consistent with what is expected. The problem seems to be directly related to the implementation of `itermonomials`, where it might fail to account for or incorrectly handle the `min_degrees` parameter. Additionally, since the problem is about the generation of monomials and their degrees, files like `sympy/polys/orderings.py` and `sympy/polys/polytools.py` might also be relevant as they deal with monomial orderings and polynomial tools respectively. However, as of now, we don't have any context indicating that these files are particularly relevant. Further, due to the specific nature of the issue, focusing the search on `sympy/polys/monomials.py` initially seems to be the best approach.",

The relevant code is in the `itermonomials` function, specifically the part where it checks if the total degree is within the minimum and maximum bounds and generates the monomials accordingly.

This behaviour is inconsistent with the documentation that states that \r\n\r\n> A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\r\n\r\nThe monomials are also missing when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`.\n"
