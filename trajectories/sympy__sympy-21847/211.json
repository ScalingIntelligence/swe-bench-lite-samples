The user provides an example where the function does not return expected monomials of total degree 3 when `min_degrees` is set to 3. This suggests that the `min_degree` condition within the function might not be correctly implemented.\n\nUpon analyzing the code in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`, the `itermonomials` function is identified as the likely source of the issue. The code checks if `min_degree` is satisfied by verifying if the maximum power in the monomial is greater than or equal to `min_degree`. This approach might be incorrect because it does not ensure that the total degree of the monomial meets the `min_degree` requirement.\n\nThe code attempts to handle both total degree and individual variable degrees, but the logic for enforcing `min_degree` seems flawed. For instance, in the total degree mode, the function only checks if the maximum power in the monomial satisfies `min_degree`, which leads to missing monomials like `x1*x2**2`. This could be corrected by ensuring all monomials with a total degree between `min_degree` and `max_degree` are generated.\n\nThe function in question is 'itermonomials', and the relevant code span is 'itermonomials' in the file 'sympy/polys/monomials.py'.",

When `total_degree` is True, the function uses combinations_with_replacement for commutative variables or product for non-commutative variables to generate monomials.
