The user's example demonstrates that the function does not return monomials with a total degree of 3 as expected when `min_degrees` is set to 3. Upon reviewing the code in the `itermonomials` function, it becomes apparent that the issue lies in how the function checks if the monomial's degree is within the specified `min_degree` and `max_degree` range. Specifically, the check `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` is incorrect because it should consider the total degree of the monomial rather than just the maximum power among the variables. This oversight results in the function omitting valid monomials that meet the total degree requirement but do not have a maximum power equal to or greater than `min_degree`. It is also worth noting that this problem only affects the case where `total_degree` is `True`, which is the case when `max_degrees` is a single integer and not a list. Therefore, the identified code span is relevant to fixing the issue described in the reported problem.",
