The provided code analysis reveals that the function uses different strategies based on whether total degrees or separate degrees for each variable are specified. The problem might be due to an incorrect calculation or condition check within the loop generating the monomials. Specifically, the condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` is used to filter monomials in the total degree case, which might incorrectly exclude valid monomials as per the user's description. Further investigation is needed to confirm this, but the identified function is clearly relevant to the issue reported.",
