The issue specifically mentions missing monomials of total degree 3, which should be included according to the documentation. Upon examination of the provided code span labeled 'itermonomials', it is evident that the function uses a combination of conditions and loops to generate monomials. The key section related to the `total_degree` case checks combinations and products of the variables, with constraints on their power values. The logic appears to have a limitation where it might not correctly handle the inclusion of monomials that meet the `min_degree` criteria, particularly when the degree is specified for each variable individually.

Specifically, the function fails to return monomials that have a total degree equal to `min_degrees`, even though the documentation states that it should. This suggests a bug in the implementation of the `itermonomials` function. The main focus should be on analyzing the `itermonomials` function in the provided code context. Additionally, reviewing the logic related to the generation and filtering of monomials based on `min_degrees` is crucial. The provided search results contain additional functions (`monomial_count`, `monomial_max`, `monomial_min`) and a class (`MacaulayResultant`) with methods related to monomials and degrees, which might indirectly support understanding the issue but are not directly related to the problem at hand.
