The example provided demonstrates that monomials with total degree of 3, such as `x1*x2**2`, are missing from the results. This behavior is inconsistent with the documentation, which states that all monomials with total degree between `min_degree` and `max_degree` should be included. The code in the search results contains the implementation of the `itermonomials` function. It checks if `max_degrees` is a sequence or a single value to determine if the function should operate based on total degree or individual degrees for each variable. The critical section is where monomials are generated and filtered based on their degrees. The current implementation filters monomials based on the maximum degree rather than ensuring that the total degree is within the specified range. This indicates that the `itermonomials` function implementation is likely the source of the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code span to address the issue is the entire `itermonomials` function body.",
