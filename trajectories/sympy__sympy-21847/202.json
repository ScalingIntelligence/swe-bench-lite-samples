The example provided demonstrates that the function does not return all monomials that should satisfy the `min_degree` constraint. The `itermonomials` function in `sympy/polys/monomials.py` appears to be the core piece of code responsible for generating monomials. It includes logic for handling both total degree and individual degrees for variables. However, the problematic behavior described suggests that the function may not be correctly implementing the logic for checking if total degree constraints are met when `min_degrees` is specified. Additionally, the `monomial_key` function in `sympy/polys/orderings.py` is used for sorting the monomials, but the issue does not seem to be related to the sorting functionality directly. Based on the issue description and the provided code, the focus should be on understanding and potentially adjusting the logic inside the `itermonomials` function regarding the handling of `min_degrees`. This includes ensuring that all combinations of variable degrees that sum up to at least `min_degrees` are correctly considered in the iteration process.",

The function's current logic involves checking if the maximum value in `powers.values()` meets the `min_degree` threshold, which seems to be a potential source of error.
