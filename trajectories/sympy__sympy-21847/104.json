The given search results contain the implementation of `itermonomials` within the SymPy library. By examining the function, it's evident that the logic inside the function is intended to handle both total degree and individual degrees. However, the handling of combinations with replacement does not appear to consider the `min_degrees` constraint appropriately, leading to the reported incorrect results. The provided code indicates that the function checks if `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree`, which is incorrect because it should ensure that the total degree (sum of the powers) meets the minimum degree requirement. This misunderstanding of how to apply the `min_degrees` constraint is the root cause of the issue, particularly in the total_degree case, which does not correctly filter out or generate monomials below the minimum total degree as specified.",
