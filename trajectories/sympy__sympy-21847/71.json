The example provided shows that the function does not return all monomials of total degree 3, which it should according to the documentation. The search results include the implementation of the `itermonomials` function in the file `sympy/polys/monomials.py`. The function's logic is analyzed to determine how it generates monomials based on the `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` arguments. Specifically, the function has different logic based on whether the `max_degrees` is a list or a single integer. When `total_degree` is True, it generates monomials using combinations_with_replacement and product, but it only includes monomials where the maximum power of any variable is greater than or equal to `min_degree`, which might be causing the issue of not including all monomials of total degree `min_degree`.
