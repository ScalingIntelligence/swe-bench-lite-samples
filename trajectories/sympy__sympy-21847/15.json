Given the involvement of symbolic variables and degrees, the relevant files are likely within the `sympy/polys` directory, with a focus on `monomials.py`, which contains the `itermonomials` function. Additionally, the `orderings.py` file, which defines monomial orderings, may also be relevant.

The example provided shows that the function fails to generate certain monomials of total degree 3, which should be included according to the documentation. The search results include the implementation of the `itermonomials` function in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. After analyzing the code, it appears that the bug lies in the logic that generates monomials when `total_degree` is True. Specifically, the condition `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` is too restrictive because it only allows monomials where the highest individual degree is at least `min_degree`, rather than checking if the total degree meets the `min_degree` requirement. This explains why monomials like `x1*x2**2` are missing, as their total degree is 3, but the highest degree in any single variable is 1 (for `x1`) and 2 (for `x2**2`). The relevant code span ID 'itermonomials' is identified as the part of the codebase likely responsible for the issue.",
