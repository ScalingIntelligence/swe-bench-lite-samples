The user reports that when using `min_degrees`, the function does not return all expected monomials of the specified degree. This discrepancy is observed when comparing the actual output against the documented behavior that states all monomials should be generated between `min_degree` and `max_degree`. The provided code snippet demonstrates this issue in action, illustrating the missing monomials of total degree 3. Upon reviewing the search results and the provided context, the problem seems to be within the implementation of the `itermonomials` function. Specifically, it appears that the function applies the `min_degree` check incorrectly, narrowing the range of valid monomials too restrictively. This evaluation is based on the observation that the function uses `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` to filter monomials, rather than ensuring that the total degree of the monomial aligns with the specified `min_degree`.",

The user is encountering incorrect results when using the `min_degrees` argument, particularly when `min_degrees` is equal to `max_degrees`. The issue states that monomials like `x1*x2**2` are not being included, which should have a total degree of 3. This indicates a problem with how the function checks for the total degree when `min_degree` and `max_degree` are equal. Analyzing the code, it appears that the logic inside the `total_degree` block is responsible for generating monomials considering the total degree. The function uses `combinations_with_replacement` or `product` to generate possible monomials and then checks if the maximum power among the variables is greater than or equal to `min_degree`. This check is insufficient to ensure that all monomials with a total degree equal to `min_degree` are included, especially when the total degree is considered.",
