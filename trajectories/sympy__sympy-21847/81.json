The function is expected to generate all monomials with a total degree between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`, but it appears to be missing some monomials that meet this criterion. The provided code snippet demonstrates that the function fails to return monomials such as `x1*x2**2` that have a total degree of 3, even when `min_degrees` is set to 3. The search results include the implementation of the `itermonomials` function in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`.\n\nUpon examining the `itermonomials` function, it seems that the issue might be related to how the function calculates and filters monomials based on the `min_degree`. Specifically, the function uses `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` to determine whether to include a monomial. This approach might be incorrect because it does not correctly account for monomials where the total degree matches `min_degree` but is distributed across multiple variables. This could explain why monomials like `x1*x2**2` are not being included.\n\nThe other code spans in the search results (`monomial_key` and `build_product_order`) are relevant for ordering the monomials but are not directly related to the issue of missing monomials when using the `min_degrees` argument. The problem lies primarily in the logic within the `itermonomials` function that handles the filtering of monomials based on the minimum degree constraint.",

For example, a monomial like `x1*x2**2` with a total degree of 3 would be missed if `min_degree` is 3, as the maximum degree of any single variable in this monomial is only 2. This explains why additional monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` are missing.
