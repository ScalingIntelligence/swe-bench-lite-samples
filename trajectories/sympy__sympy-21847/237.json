According to the user, monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2` should be included when the total degree is 3, but they are missing. The search results include the implementation of the `itermonomials` function in the file `sympy/polys/monomials.py`. This function handles the generation of monomials based on the variables, `max_degrees`, and optionally `min_degrees`. The part of the code that is relevant to the issue checks if `min_degree` is less than or equal to `max_degree` and then generates monomials accordingly. However, the user's issue suggests that there is a bug in this part of the code, possibly in how it checks or applies the `min_degrees` constraint. This is the primary area of interest for addressing the reported issue.",
