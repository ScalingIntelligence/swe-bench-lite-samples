The function fails to generate all monomials with a total degree equal to `min_degrees` when `min_degrees` is used. I examined the code in the provided search result, which includes the complete implementation of the `itermonomials` function. The function logic is split into two paths based on whether total degree or individual variable degrees are specified. The issue seems to be focused on the total degree path, where the function does not correctly filter monomials based on the `min_degree` condition. The code uses `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` to filter, which might not be fully capturing all monomials that satisfy the total degree condition. This understanding leads me to believe that the provided code span is directly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
