The provided code snippet and the search results show the implementation of the `itermonomials` function in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`.

This condition checks if the maximum power among all variables is at least `min_degree`, but it misses checking the total degree of the monomial, which should be between `min_degree` and `max_degree`. This discrepancy might be causing the missing monomials where individual variable degrees are less than `min_degree` but the total degree is within the specified range.
