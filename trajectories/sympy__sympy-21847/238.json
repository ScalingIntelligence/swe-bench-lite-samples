The provided snippet from `sympy.polys.monomials` contains the definition of `itermonomials`.

To resolve the issue, one would need to inspect and potentially modify the logic within this function. The `monomial_key` function in `sympy.polys.orderings` is used for sorting monomials, but it does not seem to be directly related to the generation of monomials, making it less relevant to the issue at hand.

Additionally, ensuring the correct use and testing of the `MonomialKey` object for ordering monomials might also be relevant but is not directly mentioned in the issue description as a problem.

This discrepancy could be the root cause of monomials with mixed degrees (e.g., `x1*x2**2`) being excluded. Additionally, the function should yield each monomial only once, which is attempted through the use of a `set`. To address the issue, it might be necessary to adjust the logic inside the `if total_degree:` block to correctly account for the total degree of each generated monomial in relation to `min_degree`.

The function employs `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` to generate monomials based on the degree constraints. However, the logic handling the `total_degree` flag seems flawed, as it fails to correctly consider the total degree of monomials when using the `min_degrees` argument. This likely results in the exclusion of monomials with mixed degrees, such as `x1*x2**2`, which should be included. The function's intent to use a `set` to ensure unique monomials suggests a rudimentary attempt at handling such a scenario, but clearly it's not achieving the desired outcome. Therefore, while the code provided is pertinent to the issue, revising the degrees checking logic in conjunction with a thorough review of how `MonomialKey` aligns with these functionalities appears necessary to fully resolve the inconsistency.",
