This behavior contradicts the documentation, which states that the function should return all monomials with total degrees between `min_degree` and `max_degree`.

The code for `itermonomials` involves handling both total degree and individual degree cases, and there are specific checks and loops to ensure that only valid monomials are generated. The relevant part of the code for `total_degree` case seems to be missing a check that properly includes all monomials with degrees equal to `min_degree`, as evidenced by the reported issue's example.

The key part of the function responsible for this is where it checks if the maximum power value in the generated monomial's power dictionary is greater than or equal to `min_degree` before yielding it. Evidently, this check wrongly excludes monomials where the total degree matches exactly `min_degree` because the comparison should use the total degree of the monomial, not the maximum power of any single variable.
