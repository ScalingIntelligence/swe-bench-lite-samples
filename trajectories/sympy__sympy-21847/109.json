This function is crucial for generating monomials within specific degree ranges, and its correctness is important for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the results in the library. To address this issue, I analyzed the code span identified by the id `itermonomials` in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. The code block seems to be the implementation of the `itermonomials` function. The analysis of this block reveals that there is indeed logic for handling the `min_degrees` argument in both total degree mode and variable-wise degree modes. The critical part of the code is responsible for generating monomials based on these constraints. However, it is worth noting that the implementation does not consider all possible combinations of variables that could result in total degrees between `min_degree` and `max_degree`. This could be the source of the error as it seems to generate monomials only at the extremes. The additional provided spans in `sympy/polys/orderings.py` do not directly address the generation of monomials but are contextually relevant to how monomials might be sorted or manipulated after generation. For now, focusing on the implementation detail within the `itermonomials` function, as provided in the current span, is the most relevant for diagnosing the issue at hand.",
