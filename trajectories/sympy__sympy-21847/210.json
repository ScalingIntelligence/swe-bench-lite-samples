The user's example demonstrates that the function does not produce all expected monomials with a total degree of 3 when `min_degrees` is set to 3. This suggests a potential bug in the implementation of `itermonomials` when dealing with the `total_degree` parameter and `min_degrees`. The search results include the actual implementation of `itermonomials` function in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file, which should be inspected to identify if there are any logical errors or omissions causing the issue. Additionally, `sympy/polys/orderings.py` contains the implementation of `monomial_key`, which is used in the sorting of monomials in the user's example. This might also be relevant to understanding why certain monomials are omitted. Given the context and the search results, I will focus on the code span within `sympy/polys/monomials.py` that implements `itermonomials` to determine if it correctly handles the `min_degrees` argument and if any adjustments are needed to align with the documented behavior.",

It appears that the function is missing monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2`, etc., which are of total degree 3 but include combinations of different variables.\n\nGiven this analysis, the focus should be on the specific part of the `itermonomials` function that enumerates monomomials and filters them based on degree requirements.
