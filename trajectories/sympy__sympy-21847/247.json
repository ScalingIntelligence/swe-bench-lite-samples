Upon reviewing the code span labeled 'itermonomials', it is evident that the function's implementation does not account for combinations of variables that collectively meet the `min_degrees` requirement. Instead, it only checks whether the maximum power across all variables meets the `min_degree`. This is likely the cause of the reported issue, as the function incorrectly filters out valid monomials that meet the `min_degree` criteria but are distributed across multiple variables.",

Specifically, monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2` with a total degree of 3 are not being generated as expected when `min_degrees` is set to 3. The given code shows how the function iterates over possible combinations, but it lacks explicit checks or logics to ensure that all monomials with the combined degree are considered when `min_degrees` is used compared to `max_degrees` set the same. This suggests an incomplete implementation but the actual fault might be in the logic that fetches or generates monomials rather than a missing part.",
