The provided code snippet demonstrates that the expected monomials (such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc.`) with a total degree of 3 are missing from the output. Upon analyzing the `itermonomials` function in the search results, it becomes clear that the function generates monomials based on the `variables`, `max_degrees`, and `min_degrees` arguments. The function checks if `max_degrees` is a sequence or a single value and adjusts its behavior accordingly. However, the logic used to generate monomials within the specified degree ranges seems to be flawed. Specifically, the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` functions to generate monomials, but the condition `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` incorrectly filters out some valid monomials that should be included. This indicates that the problematic section of the code is where the condition is applied to filter the generated monomials. This part of the code needs to be fixed to correctly handle the `min_degrees` argument and include all valid monomials as per the user's expectations.",
