The issue specifically mentions that when `min_degrees` is set to a value such as 3, the function should return all monomials of total degree 3 or greater, but it fails to do so and only returns monomials of exactly degree 3. This is inconsistent with the documentation which states that it should return all monomials within the specified degree range.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, the `itermonomials` function is found in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file. The function logic involves generating monomials based on the provided `variables`, `max_degrees`, and optionally `min_degrees`. The function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` from `itertools` to generate the monomials.\n\nThe critical part of the function is where it checks if the total degree of the generated monomial meets the `min_degree` requirement. However, the condition `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` used in the function might be incorrect for this purpose, causing it to miss some monomials within the specified degree range. This section of the code is suspected to be the source of the issue described in the reported problem.\n\nThe remaining part of the search results includes utility functions related to monomials but does not appear directly related to the `min_degrees` issue mentioned in the report. Therefore, the focus should remain on the `itermonomials` function in `monomials.py`.",
