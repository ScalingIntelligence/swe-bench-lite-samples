The example provided demonstrates that monomials like `x1*x2**2` and `x2*x3**2`, which should have a total degree of 3 as per the documentation, are missing. The issue seems to be particularly significant when `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are set to the same value or when `max_degrees` is increased above `min_degrees`. \n\nAnalyzing the provided code in 'sympy/polys/monomials.py', particularly the `itermonomials` function, it is evident that the function does handle the total degree scenario separately. However, the implementation seems to miss checking for the total degree condition when considering combinations of monomials. This oversight might be the reason why not all monomials with the required total degree are being generated. \n\nGiven the relevance of the `itermonomials` function and the identified section in the code, it is clear that this part of the code needs closer inspection and possible correction to ensure all valid monomials within the specified degree range are correctly generated. The key focus should be on refining the logic used in generating and filtering monomials based on their total degrees.",
