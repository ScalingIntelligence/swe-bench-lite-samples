Specifically, the section dealing with total degree (`total_degree = True`) uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` to generate monomials, and then filters based on the `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree`. This logic might be flawed in correctly excluding monomials of degree equal to `min_degree`. This suggests that the file context provided is relevant to the issue, but might not be complete to fully resolve the issue without deeper inspection of the involved logic and how it interacts with other parts of the code that generate and filter monomials.
