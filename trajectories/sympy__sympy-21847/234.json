Specifically, the user expects the function to return all monomials with a total degree of 3, including those like `x1*x2**2` or `x2*x3**2`, but the function is not returning these. The provided search results include the implementation of `itermonomials` in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`. Analyzing this code reveals that the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` to generate monomials, but it only checks if the max power in a combination is greater than or equal to `min_degree`, which does not cover all cases where the total degree meets the `min_degree` requirement. This is likely the cause of the issue. The code in `sympy/polys/orderings.py` is related to ordering monomials and is not directly related to the issue at hand.",
