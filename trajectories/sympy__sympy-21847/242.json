The expected behavior is that all monomials with a total degree between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` should be generated, but the current implementation is not achieving this. Upon analyzing the provided code snippet with the id 'itermonomials', it becomes clear that the function does not correctly handle the `min_degrees` parameter for total degree cases. The implementation uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` to generate monomials, but these do not account for the constraint that the total degree must be at least `min_degree`. This oversight results in missing monomials that are expected to be included. Given the detailed explanation in the issue and the direct alignment of the code snippet with the function in question, it is evident that the provided code section is highly relevant to the reported issue.",

This function manages the generation of monomials based on provided variables, max_degrees, and optionally min_degrees. The key issue seems to lie in the handling of total degree constraints when `total_degree` is True, which implies the use of a single degree constraint across all variables. The generation uses combinations_with_replacement or product from itertools without ensuring that all intermediate degrees between min_degree and max_degree are represented, especially when both are set to the same value (e.g., 3). This likely causes the omission of monomials like x1*x2**2 that have a total degree equal to both max_degree and min_degree. To further diagnose and potentially fix this issue, it would be beneficial to look for test cases in `sympy/polys` or any related modules that verify the expected behavior of `itermonomials` with the `min_degrees` parameter.",

The function should return monomials such that the total degree is between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`. The provided example demonstrates that the function is not returning the expected monomials, such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc.` when both `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are set to 3. Upon reviewing the `itermonomials` function in the <file_context> section and the corresponding code in <search_results>, it is clear that the function is designed to handle total degree and individual variable degrees separately based on the input types. The logic for handling total degree (`total_degree = True`) does not correctly check for monomials that meet the `min_degree` criterion. This seems to be the root cause of the issue.

This function manages the generation of monomials based on provided variables, max_degrees, and optionally min_degrees. The key issue seems to lie in the handling of total degree constraints when `total_degree` is True, which implies the use of a single degree constraint across all variables. The generation uses combinations_with_replacement or product from itertools without ensuring that all intermediate degrees between min_degree and max_degree are represented, especially when both are set to the same value (e.g., 3). This likely causes the omission of monomials like x1*x2**2 that have a total degree equal to both max_degree and min_degree.
