After analyzing the code span within `sympy/polys/monomials.py`, it appears the issue lies in how the function handles the `min_degree` validation and the generation of monomials. Specifically, when `total_degree` is True, the function uses `combinations_with_replacement` and `product` for commutative and non-commutative variables, respectively. However, the check `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` only ensures that the highest individual degree meets the minimum degree requirement, rather than ensuring the total degree of all variables meets this requirement. This oversight results in missing the inclusion of monomials with total degree equal to `min_degree` but not necessarily having an individual variable's degree meeting the minimum degree. This is confirmed by the example provided where monomials like `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` are expected but not returned. Therefore, the identified code span is relevant to address the reported issue.",
