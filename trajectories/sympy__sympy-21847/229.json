However, the section handling total degree seems to incorrectly filter out monomials based on the `min_degree`. The check `if max(powers.values()) >= min_degree:` might be too restrictive and does not account for monomials with degree combinations that sum up to the total degree but don't individually exceed `min_degree`.\n\nThis part of the code likely requires adjustment to correctly incorporate the `min_degrees` argument without incorrectly omitting the expected monomials.",
