The function is expected to generate all monomials with a total degree between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`, inclusive. However, the current implementation fails to include all monomials that meet this criterion, as evidenced by the example provided. Upon analyzing the code span labeled 'itermonomials', it's clear that the function uses different logic depending on whether `min_degrees` is provided as a sequence or a single value. The issue seems to arise from the logic handling when `min_degrees` is a single value (scalar), as it incorrectly filters monomials based on the `max` of the powers rather than the total degree. This leads to the omission of valid monomials. Therefore, the identified code span contains the relevant section where the error likely occurs.",
