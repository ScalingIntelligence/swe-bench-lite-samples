The error occurs specifically when multiplying a number and a Point object, unlike when multiplying a Point object and a number. This suggests a possible asymmetry in how __mul__ and __rmul__ methods are implemented or handled for Point objects and numbers in SymPy. To resolve this, it is necessary to investigate the Point class in sympy/geometry/point.py for the __mul__ and __rmul__ methods as well as related methods like __add__ which might handle the result of multiplication. Additionally, it would be beneficial to also review the Number class in sympy/core/numbers.py for how multiplication with Points might be handled differently than expected.",

The exception occurs specifically when the multiplication order is reversed, i.e., `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` instead of `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`. The issue seems to be related to the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods in the `Point` class. Reviewing the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file, we find relevant code spans in the `Point` class, specifically the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods. The `__mul__` method handles multiplication of the point by a factor, while the `__add__` method handles addition of points. The error seems to arise from the `__add__` method's inability to handle the multiplication result when the order is reversed. Additionally, the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file contains relevant code spans for the `Number`, `Float`, and `Rational` classes, which are likely involved in the multiplication operation.",

The current file context and the new search results both focus on the implementation of the Point class in sympy/geometry/point.py and the Number, Float, and Rational classes in sympy/core/numbers.py. The issue seems to be related to how the Point class handles multiplication and addition with numbers, particularly when the number is on the left side of the multiplication. The identified spans in Point.__add__ and Point.__mul__ show how the class currently handles these operations, but it appears there might be an issue with the order of operations or the type of object being added/multiplied. The new search results provide additional context on how Float and Rational handle multiplication, which could be relevant to understanding why the operation fails when the number is first. However, the key to resolving the issue likely lies in understanding how Point should handle such operations to ensure consistency regardless of the order of operands.",
