Specifically, the exception arises when attempting to multiply a number with a Point object as opposed to the other way around.

In 'point.py', there are relevant methods '__add__' and '__mul__' for the Point class, which handle addition and multiplication of Point objects. The '__mul__' method is responsible for multiplying a Point object with a factor. The exception in the reported issue is raised in the '__add__' method due to the TypeError that occurs when attempting to normalize the dimensions of the Point objects.\n\nIn 'entity.py', the GeometryEntity class includes '__radd__' and '__rmul__' methods, which manage reverse addition and reverse multiplication. These methods could also be relevant because they ensure that the operations can be performed in both orders.\n\nThe identified code spans should include the '__add__', '__mul__', '__radd__', and '__rmul__' methods as they are directly related to the issue of handling addition and multiplication of Point objects. By examining and potentially modifying these methods, the desired behavior where multiplication and addition can be performed in both orders without raising exceptions can be achieved.",
