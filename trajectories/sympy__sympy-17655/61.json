However, it does implement the `__mul__` method, which handles multiplication when the `Point` object is on the right-hand side. The `GeometryEntity` class, a base class for `Point`, does implement `__rmul__` but delegates the operation back to the left-hand side object's `__mul__` method. This means that the behavior of reverse multiplication (`__rmul__`) is expected to be handled by the left-hand side object in a typical Pythonic manner, relying on that object's `__mul__` method. Given this context, it appears that the issue might lie in how the left-hand side object (in this case, the result of `sympy.sympify(2.0)`) interacts with the `Point` object through its `__mul__` method or how `symPy` handles the `Mul` operation involving these types. Further examination of the `Mul` class in `sympy/core/mul.py` is recommended to understand how multiplication operations are handled in SymPy, particularly with respect to geometric entities like `Point`.",

However, it does implement the `__mul__` method, which handles multiplication when the `Point` object is on the right-hand side. The `GeometryEntity` class, a base class for `Point`, does implement `__rmul__` but delegates the operation back to the left-hand side object's `__mul__` method. This means that the behavior of reverse multiplication (`__rmul__`) is expected to be handled by the left-hand side object in a typical Pythonic manner, relying on that object's `__mul__` method. Given this context, it appears that the issue might lie in how the left-hand side object (in this case, the result of `sympy.sympify(2.0)`) interacts with the `Point` object through its `__mul__` method or how `symPy` handles the `Mul` operation involving these types. Further examination of the `Mul` class in `sympy/core/mul.py` is recommended to understand how multiplication operations are handled in SymPy, particularly with respect to geometric entities like `Point`.",

The search results include the `Mul` class from `sympy/core/mul.py`, which is likely relevant because it handles multiplication operations. The `Mul.flatten` method and other related methods in the `Mul` class are particularly relevant as they handle the flattening of multiplication sequences, which could be where the issue arises when mixing `Point` objects with other types. Additionally, the `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` method from `sympy/geometry/entity.py` is relevant as it provides the right multiplication support for geometry entities, potentially interacting with the `Mul` class. The identified code spans in `sympy/geometry/point.py` (like `Point.__add__` and `Point.__mul__`) are critical for understanding how `Point` objects handle arithmetic operations and how they might interact with `Mul` during multiplication.

The issue arises when attempting to multiply a `Point` object from the left by a general expression like `sympy.sympify(2.0)`, which doesn't have a specific `__mul__` method defined for interactions with `Point`. The `__rmul__` method in the `GeometryEntity` class delegates the right multiplication back to the left-hand side object's `__mul__` method, which in this case is the `Mul` class from `sympy.core.mul`.
