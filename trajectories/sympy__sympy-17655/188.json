Specifically, the error occurs when trying to multiply a Point object by a sympified number and then add it to another Point object. This contrasts with the successful operation when the multiplication is done before the addition. Given this, the focus should be on understanding how the Point class and its arithmetic operations are implemented, particularly the __mul__ method for multiplication and the __add__ method for addition. The code span provided includes the __mul__ method definition, which is crucial for understanding how multiplication by a factor is handled for a Point object. This method uses sympify to convert the factor into a SymPy object and then multiplies each coordinate of the Point by this factor. This span is directly relevant to the issue because it deals with the multiplication operation that leads to the TypeError when combined with the addition operation.\n\nThe relevance of this code span is validated by the fact that it directly involves the multiplication of a Point object, which is at the core of the reported issue. Additionally, the method is part of the Point class, which is clearly the class involved in the problem. Therefore, this span is not only relevant but also necessary for addressing the issue, as it provides the context needed to understand how multiplication is currently implemented for Point objects and potentially why the error occurs. Given the limited information and focusing solely on the provided search results, this span is sufficient to start addressing the issue but additional context or code related to the __add__ method might be needed to fully resolve the problem.",

Specifically, the expression `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError` while the expression `point1 + point2 * sympify(2.0)` works fine.\n\nAnalyzing the search results and the file context, I observe that both the search results and the file context contain relevant spans that might address the issue. The `Point` class is central to the issue as it involves operations on `Point` objects. Notably, the methods `__add__` and `__mul__` in the `Point` class are directly related to the problem.\n\nThe `__add__` method in the `Point` class attempts to normalize dimensions and handle addition, but it raises a `GeometryError` if the addition involves incompatible types. This is likely the source of the problem when trying to add a `Point` object and a `Mul` object returned by `sympify(2.0) * point2`.\n\nThe `__mul__` method, however, is correctly defined to handle multiplication of a `Point` object and a factor. This method is crucial as it underpins the expected behavior of multiplying a point and a number. Despite this correct implementation, the issue arises from the subsequent addition operation.\n\nFrom the search results, I have identified additional spans that might be relevant: \n- `Point.__div__`, `Point.__neg__`, `Point.are_coplanar`, `Point.evalf`, `Point.intersection`, `Point.is_concyclic`, `Point.midpoint`, `Point.origin`, `Point.orthogonal_direction`\n- `Point2D` and its methods `__new__`, `rotate`, `translate`\n- `Point3D` and its method `__new__`\n- `GeometryEntity` and its method `__rmul__`\n\nThese spans are broader context around the `Point` class in `sympy.geometry.point.py` and the `GeometryEntity` class in `sympy.geometry.entity.py`. They provide a comprehensive view of how points are handled in the geometry module and how operations like multiplication and addition are intended to be performed.\n\nBased on this analysis, I am identifying the relevant code spans related to the issue reported, focusing on the `Point` class methods that directly deal with addition and multiplication as these are the operations that do not behave as expected.",

The code examples show that `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises an exception. This suggests a problem with how the multiplication is handled in the `__mul__` method of the `Point` class or with the `__rmul__` method in the `GeometryEntity` class. From the search results, it's clear that the `__mul__` method for `Point` exists and correctly handles multiplication with sympified factors, but there might be an issue with the reverse multiplication handled by `__rmul__`. The relevant code spans to investigate further are those containing the `__mul__` method in `Point` and the `__rmul__` method in `GeometryEntity`.",
