The problem arises when attempting to multiply a `Point` object by a `sympy.sympify(2.0)` and adding it to another `Point` object. The error message indicates that there is a type mismatch when trying to add a 'Mul' object and a 'Point' object. To resolve this, we need to investigate how the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods are defined in the `Point` class and related classes. Additionally, we should inspect how `sympify` transforms `2.0` and how it interacts with `Point` objects.",

Specifically, the exception occurs when multiplying `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` instead of `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`. The issue points to the `__add__` method in the `Point` class as the source of the problem. The current file context includes methods `__mul__`, `__neg__`, and `__div__` in the `Point` class, which indicate that multiplication, negation, and division for `Point` objects are defined. However, the exception message indicates that the `__add__` method does not handle the addition of a `Point` object and an expression like `2.0 * Point2D(1, 1)` correctly. The new search results show the definition of the `__add__` method, which tries to normalize dimensions and add corresponding coordinates but fails if `other` is not a valid point. Given the issue description and the existing methods, the relevant code span is the `__add__` method in the `Point` class.",

The `Point` class's `__add__` method attempts to add two `Point` objects by normalizing their dimensions and summing their coordinates. If the addition is not possible with the given type, it raises a `GeometryError`. The `Number` class and its subclass `Float` in `sympy/core/numbers.py` also define how multiplication is handled with various types of numbers. The `__mul__` method for `Float` explicitly handles multiplication with other `Number` instances using the `mpmath` library.
