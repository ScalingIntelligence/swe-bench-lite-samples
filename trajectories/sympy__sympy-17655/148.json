The main problem is that the multiplication operation between a Point and a Number is not symmetric. The code spans identified include the __mul__ methods for the Point class, which correctly multiplies each coordinate of the Point by a factor, and the __mul__ methods for various Number subclasses (Float, Rational, Integer). These methods handle the multiplication between numbers but do not cover the case where a Point is being multiplied by a Number from the left. The issue likely arises because the Point class does not define an __rmul__ method to handle this case, while the Number subclasses do not handle multiplication with a Point directly. Therefore, the relevant code that needs to be fixed or extended is the Point class's __mul__ method and potentially the Number subclasses' __rmul__ methods.",
