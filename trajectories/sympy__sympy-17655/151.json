The error occurs specifically when the number is multiplied before the `Point` object, indicating a possible issue with the right multiplication (`__rmul__`) or the handling of Point objects in such operations. The relevant classes and methods to investigate include those related to Point (`geometry.point.Point`), number operations (`core.numbers.Number`), and the general expression handling (`core.mul.Mul` and `core.expr.Expr`). It's crucial to check the implementation of `__mul__` and `__rmul__` for the respective classes to understand the order of operations and error handling. Therefore, the search should specifically focus on these methods across the mentioned classes and files to pinpoint the exact cause and potential fix for the issue.",
