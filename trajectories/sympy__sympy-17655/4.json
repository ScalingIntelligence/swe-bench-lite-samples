The exception occurs specifically when trying to multiply a sympy.sympify(2.0) with a Point object, which raises a TypeError and a GeometryError. The expected behavior is that both methods should yield the same result. The key to resolving this issue lies in understanding how sympy handles the multiplication of Point objects with numbers and ensuring consistency in the operations. The relevant code spans from the search results include the Point class definition, the Point.__add__ method, and the __mul__ methods of Number, Float, Rational, and Integer classes. These methods are crucial for understanding how sympy handles arithmetic operations involving Points and numbers. The Point.__add__ method is particularly relevant as it directly handles the addition of Point objects, which is being attempted after the multiplication in the failing code. The __mul__ methods for Number, Float, Rational, and Integer classes define how these types interact with other objects, including potentially Point objects. By examining these spans, we can identify the necessary modifications to handle the multiplication of a Point object with a number correctly and consistently.",

The analysis of the provided code reveals that the Point class itself does not directly implement the __mul__ or __rmul__ methods, which suggests that these methods may be inherited from superclasses. Specifically, in sympy/geometry/point.py, the Point class does not have an implementation for __mul__ and __rmul__. The subclasses Point2D and Point3D also do not override these methods from their base class. Furthermore, the closest method that could potentially handle multiplication, __div__, is primarily focused on division rather than multiplication. Consequently, the desired behavior (multiplication of a Point object with a number using sympy.sympify) is not explicitly defined in the Point class or its subclasses. This may explain the observed TypeError and GeometryError when attempting such operations. In parallel, the sympy/core/numbers.py file shows implementations of the __mul__ method in the Number, Float, and Rational classes. These implementations handle multiplication involving these numerical types but do not directly address the scenario of multiplying numerical types with geometry.Point objects. To resolve the issue, it may be necessary to explicitly implement or extend the __mul__ and __rmul__ methods in the Point class or relevant superclasses to appropriately handle the interaction between geometry.Point objects and numerical values processed by sympy.sympify.",

The issue seems to be related to the order of operations when multiplying the `Point` object with a number that has been sympified. The exception is being raised in the `__add__` method of the `Point` class. The search results provided contain the relevant sections of the `point.py` file, specifically focusing on the `Point` class and its methods, including `__mul__`, `__add__`, and `__new__`. These methods are crucial for understanding how the `Point` object interacts with other objects, especially numbers. Additionally, the `Point` class methods for handling arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication are found in the search results, which are directly related to the reported issue. The methods `__add__` and `__mul__` handle the addition and multiplication operations, respectively, for the `Point` class. The methods `__new__`, `_normalize_dimension`, and others are also relevant as they deal with the creation and dimensional normalization of `Point` objects, which are indirect contributors to the arithmetic operations. With these code spans, we can analyze and potentially address the issue of the unexpected exception when multiplying a `Point` object and a number.",

The analysis of the provided code reveals that the Point class itself does not directly implement the __mul__ or __rmul__ methods, which suggests that these methods may be inherited from superclasses. Specifically, in sympy/geometry/point.py, the Point class does not have an implementation for __mul__ and __rmul__. The subclasses Point2D and Point3D also do not override these methods from their base class. Furthermore, the closest method that could potentially handle multiplication, __div__, is primarily focused on division rather than multiplication. Consequently, the desired behavior (multiplication of a Point object with a number using sympy.sympify) is not explicitly defined in the Point class or its subclasses. This may explain the observed TypeError and GeometryError when attempting such operations. In parallel, the sympy/core/numbers.py file shows implementations of the __mul__ method in the Number, Float, and Rational classes. These implementations handle multiplication involving these numerical types but do not directly address the scenario of multiplying numerical types with geometry.Point objects. To resolve the issue, it may be necessary to explicitly implement or extend the __mul__ and __rmul__ methods in the Point class or relevant superclasses to appropriately handle the interaction between geometry.Point objects and numerical values processed by sympy.sympify.",
