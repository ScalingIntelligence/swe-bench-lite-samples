The user identified a TypeError and a GeometryError when attempting to multiply `sympy.sympify(2.0)` with `point2` and then add the result to `point1`. The expected behavior is that both multiplication orders should give the same result. For this reason, I examined the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file to identify relevant code spans that handle addition (`__add__`) and multiplication (`__mul__`) of `Point` instances. I found two relevant methods: `Point.__add__` and `Point.__mul__`. The relevant part of the `Point.__add__` method manages the addition of two points, while the `Point.__mul__` method is responsible for the multiplication of a point by a factor. Since the issue is related to the interaction between these methods and the specific order of multiplication, these spans are highly relevant.",

The `GeometryEntity` class, from which `Point` inherits, does define `__rmul__`, but this implementation relies on the left operand's `__mul__` method. This suggests that the problem might be that the `Point` class's `__mul__` method does not handle the case where the `Point` object is on the right-hand side of the multiplication. To address this, the `Point` class might need a more comprehensive handling of the multiplication operation, possibly by explicitly defining `__rmul__` to ensure that multiplication operations involving `Point` objects are consistently handled regardless of their position in the operation.",
