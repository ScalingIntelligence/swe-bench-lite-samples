The exception occurs when attempting to multiply a number by a point, unlike when multiplying a point by a number. This discrepancy suggests an issue with the handling of multiplication operation order in the Point class. The current context indicates no relevant code has been identified yet.\n\nUpon analyzing the new search results, particularly the code spans from `sympy/geometry/point.py`, it becomes clear that the `Point` class and its `__mul__` method are pivotal. The method correctly handles multiplication of a point by a factor but does not address the reverse order. This aligns with the issue described and suggests that the current implementation might not account for multiplication where a number precedes the point object.\n\nFurthermore, examining `sympy/core/numbers.py` exposes the `Number.__mul__` method, which does not specifically handle multiplication involving Point objects. There is no explicit handling or error prevention for operations involving objects outside its defined set of types (like Point), which could contribute to the TypeError encountered.\n\nBased on these observations, the identified code spans directly relate to the reported issue, focusing on the multiplication operations involving Point and Number classes, which are critical in addressing the problem. Given the relevance and focus on the appropriate sections of the codebase, the task seems complete in identifying the necessary code spans.",

The file context provided contains the relevant `Point` class and its methods (`__add__`, `__mul__`), as well as related exception handling for GeometryError in `point.py`. Additionally, `numbers.py` contains core Number handling methods (`__mul__`, `__div__`) which might be involved indirectly.

Make sure the `Point._normalize_dimension` and other methods/attributes used are correctly defined and accessible within the context of the Point class.\n\nThe instruction asks to ensure that all attributes and methods accessed within the `__add__` method exist in the Point class or its superclass and are correctly referred to. The `__add__` method (lines 185-227) uses `Point._normalize_dimension` (line 222) which is defined at line 297. This method should be checked for correctness and accessibility from within `__add__`. The start line should be set from the method definition of `_normalize_dimension` to ensure that all necessary checks and modifications are encompassed.",
