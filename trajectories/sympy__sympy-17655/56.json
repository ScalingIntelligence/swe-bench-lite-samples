The error occurs specifically when the multiplication is in the form `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` and not when the multiplication is done the other way around `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`. This suggests that the `__rmul__` method for `Point` objects might not be implemented or behaves differently compared to the `__mul__` method. To find the root cause, we need to examine the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods in the `geometry.Point` class and related classes in SymPy, focusing on how they handle multiplication with numbers.",

The first operation `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works, but the second `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a TypeError and a GeometryError. This discrepancy in behavior suggests a potential issue with the __mul__ method in the Point class or with how sympify interacts with Point objects. To address this, I reviewed the `__mul__` method in the Point class and the `__mul__` methods in related classes such as Number and Float in the core/numbers.py file.

The `Float` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, however, does define the `__mul__` method, which can handle multiplication with `Number` objects, but it does not have a corresponding `__rmul__` method to handle the reverse case. This asymmetry is causing the issue in the operation `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`. To resolve this, the `Point` class should implement the `__rmul__` method to properly handle such operations.
