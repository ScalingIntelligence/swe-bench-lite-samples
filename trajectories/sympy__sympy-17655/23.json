This issue is related to the implementation of the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods in the `Point` class and potentially its interaction with `sympify`. From the search results, it's evident that the `Point` class (in 'sympy/geometry/point.py') has a custom `__mul__` method but lacks a custom `__rmul__` method, which might be causing the issue when the multiplication order is reversed. Additionally, the `GeometryEntity` class (in 'sympy/geometry/entity.py') has an `__rmul__` method, but it relies on the `__mul__` method of the other object, which in this case is a sympified float. The presence of `__rmul__` in `GeometryEntity` suggests potential for reverse multiplication support that isn't fully implemented or tested for the `Point` class specifically. The relevant spans of code are those that define the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods, as they are directly responsible for handling multiplication operations and could contain the source of the error or the necessary fixes to address the issue. Thus, the direct implementations and interactions of these methods with other types, such as sympified floats, are critical to understanding and resolving the reported issue. Identifying these methods in the provided search results indicates that they are relevant to the reported issue, meaning the search task can be considered complete.",

The user provided examples demonstrate that `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a TypeError. This indicates an issue with the order of operations or the handling of the `__rmul__` method by the Point class. From the file context, we already have identified code spans for `Point.__mul__` and `GeometryEntity.__rmul__`. In the new search results, we find the `Point.__add__` method, which is relevant because it shows how addition is handled between a Point object and another object. The TypeError exception handling in `Point.__add__` is particularly significant, as it directly relates to the error encountered by the user. This method needs to be able to handle cases where `other` is not directly a Point object, indicating a potential gap in how right multiplication (`__rmul__`) feeds into addition (`__add__`). The identified spans thus far cover essential parts of object multiplication and addition within the Point class, addressing the key aspects of the reported issue.",
