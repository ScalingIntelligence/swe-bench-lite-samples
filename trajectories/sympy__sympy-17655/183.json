The relevant classes and methods to investigate are `Point`, `GeometryEntity`, `Mul`, and `Number`. The main focus should be on the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods, as well as the `__add__` method where the exception is raised. The specific error message 'GeometryError: Don't know how to add 2.0*Point2D(1, 1) and a Point object' suggests that the error is happening due to the order of multiplication when adding the points. Therefore, the search should be concentrated on these methods in the specified classes.",

The error occurs specifically when multiplying a number by a Point object, which suggests a problem with how the __rmul__ method is handled for Point objects. From the search results, the relevant files and spans of code can be identified by looking at the classes and methods involved in arithmetic operations for Point objects and their interaction with numbers. The key spans to look at are the implementation of __mul__ and __rmul__ for Point objects, as well as the handling of multiplication in the Number class. This is because the issue likely arises from a mismatch or lack of support for commutative property in these operations. The identified spans of code thus include the __mul__ method in sympy/geometry/point.py, which handles multiplication of a Point object by a factor, and the __rmul__ method in sympy/geometry/entity.py, which defines behavior for reverse multiplication. Additionally, the __mul__ method of the Number class in sympy/core/numbers.py is relevant to understand how numbers interact with other types during multiplication.",
