Specifically, multiplying `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError`. This suggests a potential issue with how `Point` objects handle being multiplied on the left-hand side as compared to the right-hand side.\n\nReviewing the search results, several key spans could be relevant:\n1. `Point.__add__` handles addition of points but may not account for mixed addition with a `Mul` object.\n2. `Point.__mul__` defines the multiplication of a point by a factor from the right-hand side.\n3. `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` might handle the situation where the point is being multiplied from the left-hand side, but given the traceback, it seems not to be handled correctly.\n\nGiven the issue, it appears that the code that needs to be looked at most closely is the `__mul__` method in `sympy/geometry/point.py` to see how it handles multiplication from the right-hand side, and the `__rmul__` method in `sympy/geometry/entity.py` to ensure it correctly delegates to `__mul__` for points.\n\nThese areas seem to be the most likely sources of the problem, as they directly deal with the arithmetic operations that are failing in the reported issue.",
