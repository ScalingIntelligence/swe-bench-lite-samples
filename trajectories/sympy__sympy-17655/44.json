The error occurs specifically when multiplying `sympy.sympify(2.0)` with a `Point` object, leading to a `TypeError` due to the unexpected object type. The stack trace indicates that the error originates from the `__add__` method in the `Point` class within `sympy/geometry/point.py`. To resolve this issue, we need to investigate the multiplication and addition logic within `Point` and other relevant classes like `GeometryEntity`, `Number`, and `Expr`, focusing on the `__mul__`, `__rmul__`, and `__add__` methods.",

Specifically, the code `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a TypeError. The error occurs in the `__add__` method of the Point class because it does not know how to handle the multiplication with a Point object on the left side of the multiplication operator. The relevant code spans to identify are those related to the `__add__`, `__mul__`, and `__rmul__` methods in both the Point class and the Expr class, as they are likely involved in the arithmetic operations that are failing. Additionally, understanding the symmetric operations (like __mul__ and __rmul__) in the Expr class is crucial, as they handle operations from the other side of the operand, which might be causing the issue in this case. The identified spans should provide insight into how the multiplication operation is being handled in the context of Point objects and potentially where the issue lies.",

The relevant sections of the code are in the point.py file, particularly the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods of the Point class.\n\nI reviewed the provided code spans in the point.py file, focusing on the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods. The `__mul__` method multiplies each coordinate of the Point by a factor. The `__add__` method tries to add two Point objects by normalizing their dimensions, but if the second argument is not a Point, it raises a GeometryError.\n\nGiven the issue, the relevant code spans are those where these operations are defined.
