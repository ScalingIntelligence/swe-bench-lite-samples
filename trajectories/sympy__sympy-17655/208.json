Specifically, `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError`. The exception indicates that the system doesn't know how to handle the multiplication in this order, leading to the improper handling of the `Mul` object in the `__add__` method of the `Point` class.\n\nReviewing the current context and the provided search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans involve the multiplication and addition methods of the `Point` class. The `__mul__` method in the `Point` class correctly handles the multiplication of a `Point` by a factor, but the issue arises when this multiplication order is reversed and the result is attempted to be added to another `Point`.\n\nFrom the search results, the `Point.__add__` method is identified as problematic because it doesn't handle cases where the `other` object being added is not directly a `Point` but rather a `Mul` object resulting from a reversed multiplication order. This is the root cause of the reported exception.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the code in the `Point.__add__` method should be enhanced to properly handle `Mul` objects (or any other expected expressions) that result from operations like `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`. This enhancement would ensure that any type of object (not just `Point`) can be properly added to a `Point` instance, thus eliminating the reported exception.\n\nThe identified spans of code that are relevant to this issue are those pertaining to the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods in the `Point` class, as they are directly involved in the operations failing in the reported issue.",
