The expected behavior is that both 'point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)' and 'point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2' should yield the same result without exceptions. The analysis of the search results shows that the relevant code spans are found in 'sympy/geometry/point.py'. Relevant spans include '__add__', '__mul__', '_normalize_dimension', and 'is_scalar_multiple' methods within the Point class. These spans cover the operations and checks that could be causing the exception.
