            "scratch_pad": "The issue reported involves unexpected behavior when multiplying a `Point` object from SymPy's `geometry` module with a number, specifically when the number precedes the `Point` object in the multiplication. This asymmetry in behavior is critical to understand and resolve. The current context indicates no relevant code has been identified yet. The new search results include code spans from `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/geometry/entity.py`. In `sympy/geometry/point.py`, the `__mul__` method for the `Point` class is defined, which handles the multiplication of a `Point` object by a factor. This method correctly multiplies each coordinate by the factor and returns a new `Point` object. However, in `sympy/geometry/entity.py`, the `__rmul__` method for the `GeometryEntity` class (which `Point` inherits from) is defined to delegate the multiplication to the `__mul__` method of the factor, which is correct as per Python's method resolution order for handling reverse multiplication. This suggests that the issue might not be directly with these methods but perhaps with how the `Point` object is being added to another object in the context of the reported exception. The exception traceback indicates that the error occurs during the addition operation, where a `GeometryError` is raised because the system does not know how to add a `Mul` object (resulting from the multiplication of the number and the `Point` object) and a `Point` object. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant as they provide the context for how multiplication and addition of `Point` objects are handled in SymPy. However, further investigation might be needed to fully resolve the issue of asymmetry in the multiplication and addition operations.",
