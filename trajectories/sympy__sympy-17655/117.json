The user observes that the operation 'point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)' works fine, but 'point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2' raises a TypeError. This suggests a potential flaw in the handling of the multiplication and addition operations for Point objects in the sympy library. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans include the '__add__' and '__mul__' methods within the Point class in the 'sympy/geometry/point.py' file. These methods are directly involved in performing the addition and multiplication operations on Point objects. The '__add__' method attempts to normalize dimensions but fails when encountering an unexpected type, raising a GeometryError if the addition isn't understood. The '__mul__' method multiplies the coordinates of the Point by the given factor, which seems to work fine when point2 is multiplied by the factor first. The identified spans offer a good starting point to investigate and potentially resolve the issue, as they encapsulate the code that defines the behavior of multiplication and addition for Point objects.",
