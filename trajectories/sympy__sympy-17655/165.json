The key areas of interest are the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods within the `Point` class, as they handle multiplication and addition operations respectively. The exception traceback also points to `Point._normalize_dimension` as a source of the issue, suggesting that the method fails to handle the `Mul` object properly. Looking at the relevant code spans in `sympy/geometry/point.py`, the `__mul__` method for `Point` only considers the right-hand side multiplication, which might cause issues when the order is reversed. Similarly, the `__add__` method in `Point` also needs to be reviewed for proper handling of mixed types. Thus, the identified spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

The exception is raised when attempting the operation `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` but not when doing `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`. This suggests a potential problem with the reverse multiplication operation implemented in the `__rmul__` method of the `Point` class or possibly the `Expr` class handling the reverse multiplication for SymPy expressions. The provided file context and search results include the relevant parts of the `Point` class, showing the `__mul__` method but not explicitly the `__rmul__`. The search results do include `__rmul__` in the `GeometryEntity` and `Expr` classes, which suggests these are likely places to look for the issue. The `__rmul__` method in `GeometryEntity` attempts to delegate back to the `__mul__` method of the other object. The `__rmul__` method in `Expr` creates a `Mul` object with the reverse order of the operands. The key to solving this issue likely involves ensuring that the `__rmul__` method correctly handles the multiplication with `Point` objects, possibly by including explicit handling of `Point` objects or ensuring that the `Point` class's `__mul__` method can handle being called with reversed operands. The `Expr` class's handling of `__rmul__` seems standard, so the custom logic in `Point`'s `__mul__` may need adjustment.",
