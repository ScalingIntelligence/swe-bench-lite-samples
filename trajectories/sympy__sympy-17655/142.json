The exception occurs specifically when the multiplication order is reversed, i.e., 'sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2' raises an error, whereas 'point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)' works fine. This suggests an improper handling of reverse multiplication (__rmul__) for the Point class. The GeometryError indicates that the system doesn't know how to handle the combination of a Point object with another type in a reverse arithmetic operation. To resolve this, the __rmul__ method in the Point class or the related classes should be investigated and potentially corrected to handle such cases.",

The provided context includes code spans from `sympy/geometry/point.py`, `sympy/geometry/entity.py`, `sympy/core/numbers.py`, and `sympy/core/expr.py`. The new search results supplement this context with additional relevant methods within `sympy/geometry/point.py`, such as `__new__`, `__abs__`, `__add__`, `__div__`, `__eq__`, `__mul__`, `__neg__`, `_normalize_dimension`, `dot`, `equals`, `intersection`, `is_collinear`, `is_concyclic`, `is_nonzero`, `is_zero`, `length`, `midpoint`, `origin`, `orthogonal_direction`, `project`. These methods provide a comprehensive understanding of how points are initialized, manipulated, and interact with other objects. The key focus for addressing the issue at hand lies in understanding the propagation of the TypeError in `__add__` method and how the mathematical operations respect the point-number interaction. Given the substantial context provided and the detailed methods now understood, it confirms that the identified spans are relevant for addressing the reported issue.",

The Point class contains methods for addition (__add__), multiplication (__mul__), and division (__div__), among others. However, I did not find an explicit implementation of __rmul__ in the Point class, which would handle the reverse multiplication case. The default handling of reverse multiplication is provided by the GeometryEntity class in sympy/geometry/entity.py through its __rmul__ method, but it is unclear if this implementation specifically addresses the issue of Point multiplication with scalars in the reverse order. Since the reported issue is about reverse multiplication with a scalar throwing an exception, it seems that the current implementation might not fully cover this scenario. For a comprehensive resolution of the issue, an explicit __rmul__ method in the Point class that deals specifically with the reverse multiplication of a Point by a scalar might be necessary to ensure consistent behavior.",
