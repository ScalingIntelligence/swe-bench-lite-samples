The error occurs specifically when trying to multiply a number by a Point object, whereas the operation works fine in reverse order. This suggests an asymmetry in how multiplication is handled between Point objects and numbers. To diagnose and possibly fix this issue, it's crucial to investigate the implementations of the `__mul__`, `__rmul__`, and `__add__` methods within the Point class and related classes, particularly focusing on how these methods handle different types of operands.",

The search results provide relevant code spans in the 'sympy/geometry/point.py' file that handle the addition and multiplication of Point objects. Key spans include '__add__' and '__mul__' methods in the Point class, which are directly related to the operations in the reported issue. The '__add__' method handles the addition of points and throws a GeometryError if it doesn't know how to handle the addition involving a Point object, which matches the exception in the issue description. The '__mul__' method in the Point class handles multiplication of a point by a factor, converting it to a SymPy expression and attempting to multiply each coordinate by this factor. The search results also include relevant code from 'sympy/core/numbers.py', which defines the multiplication behavior for Number, Float, and Rational classes. These are important as they define how numbers are multiplied in SymPy, which could play a role in the unexpected behavior observed in the issue. Furthermore, 'sympy/matrices/common.py' includes matrix arithmetic definitions that might have implications for how Points interact with numbers if they are treated as matrices, though this is less directly related to the issue at hand. The 'sympy/core/mul.py' file defines the behavior of the Mul class, including flattening and collapsing multiplications, which is also relevant to understanding how multiplications work in general in SymPy.
