The expected behavior is for both multiplication orders to yield the same result without any exceptions. Based on the error trace and the method names mentioned, the relevant classes and methods to investigate are `Point`, `__mul__`, `__rmul__`, and potentially the `Number` and `Float` classes from `sympy.core.numbers`.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves unexpected behavior when multiplying a `geometry.Point` and a number. The issue specifically details that `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError`. This suggests the multiplication operation might not be commutative in the context of `Point` and numbers.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, we find the following relevant code:\n\n1. In `sympy/core/numbers.py`, there are definitions for `Number` and `Float`, including their `__mul__` methods. The `__mul__` method for `Float` specifically handles multiplication with other numbers, which could be relevant since `sympy.sympify(2.0)` converts the number to a `Float`.\n\n2. In `sympy/geometry/point.py`, the `Point` class has a `__mul__` method that multiplies each coordinate of the point by a given factor. This method could be the source of the issue since it only defines multiplication from the left-hand side, unlike the right-hand side multiplication required by the error.\n\n3. In `sympy/geometry/entity.py`, there is a `GeometryEntity` class which includes an `__rmul__` method. This method is designed to handle the right-hand side multiplication for `GeometryEntity` instances, which `Point` inherits from. This method defers to the `__mul__` method of the other object, which gets us back to the `Float` class or possibly the `Number` class, neither of which directly handle `Point` objects.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified code spans are likely relevant to solving the issue. They cover the multiplication operations for both `Float` and `Point` objects, which are central to the reported problem.\n\nThe search task is not complete without understanding how the `__rmul__` method in `GeometryEntity` interacts with the `__mul__` method in `Float` to handle cases where a `Float` is on the left and a `Point` is on the right in a multiplication operation. This interaction is not fully defined and could be causing the `TypeError`.",
