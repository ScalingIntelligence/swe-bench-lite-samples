This suggests an issue with how the Point class handles addition and multiplication, particularly when the multiplication result is not immediately a Point object. The search results indicate that the Point class has methods for addition (__add__) and multiplication (__mul__). The __add__ method attempts to normalize the dimensions of the points being added and raises a GeometryError if it doesn't know how to add the objects. The __mul__ method multiplies each coordinate of the point by a given factor. The issue likely arises from the __add__ method not being able to handle a multiplication result (which is not immediately a Point object) properly. To resolve this, the __add__ method should be able to handle the result of __mul__ or the __mul__ method should ensure the result is still treated as a Point object.",
