The user expects both `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` and `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` to give the same result. The error occurs because the `Point` class doesn't know how to handle the multiplication when the Point object is on the right side of the multiplication. I analyzed the code spans in 'sympy/geometry/point.py' and 'sympy/core/numbers.py' to identify relevant parts. The relevant method in 'sympy/geometry/point.py' is `__mul__`, which handles the multiplication of a Point with a factor. However, there is no corresponding `__rmul__` method to handle the multiplication when the Point object is on the right. This is likely the cause of the error. I also checked the `__mul__` method in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' for `Number`, `Float`, and `Rational` classes, but they don't specifically deal with the case when the right operand is a Point object. Therefore, I believe the relevant code spans are in 'sympy/geometry/point.py', specifically the `__mul__` method and potentially the absence of an `__rmul__` method.",
