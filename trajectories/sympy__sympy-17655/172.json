The exception indicates that the system does not know how to handle the addition of a Mul object (resulting from the multiplication of the number and the Point) and a Point object. To address this, it is crucial to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle the addition and multiplication of Point objects. The search results include the Point class definition and its methods for addition (__add__) and multiplication (__mul__). The __add__ method attempts to normalize the dimensions of the points to be added and raises a GeometryError if it encounters a TypeError, which matches the exception described. The __mul__ method multiplies each coordinate of the point by a factor.
