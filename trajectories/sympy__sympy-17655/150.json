To understand and resolve this issue, it is crucial to delve into the `__rmul__` method in the Point class, as well as how sympy.core.numbers handles multiplication with objects of different types to ensure symmetry.

This is likely why the operation `number * Point` is failing as it expects the `Point` class to handle the reverse multiplication. Additionally, while the `__mul__` method in the `Point` class is defined, it does not account for the reverse order. On the other hand, in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, the `Float` and `Integer` classes do have `__mul__` methods that handle multiplication with numbers. However, there's no specific handling for reverse multiplication with instances of the `Point` class. This asymmetry could be addressed by either implementing an `__rmul__` method in the `Point` class or by ensuring that the multiplication methods in `sympy/core/numbers.py` handle interaction with `Point` objects uniformly.",

Specifically, the expression `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError` and a `GeometryError`, while the equivalent expression `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` executes without issues. The key elements to focus on are the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods in the `Point` class. The current context already includes relevant code spans for these methods in `sympy/geometry/point.py`. The new search results also provide additional methods from the `Point` class, such as `__contains__`, `__div__`, `__eq__`, `__getitem__`, `__hash__`, `__iter__`, `__len__`, `__neg__`, `__sub__`, `_normalize_dimension`, `affine_rank`, `dot`, `equals`, `is_collinear`, and `is_concyclic`. Additionally, there are relevant methods in the `Number` and `Float` classes in `sympy/core/numbers.py`. However, the primary focus for identifying the problem and potential solution lies within the `Point` class methods, particularly the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods, and how they handle operations with numbers. The goal is to ensure that both `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` and `point1 + point2 * sympify(2.0)` work consistently without exceptions.",

Additionally, while the `__mul__` method in the `Point` class is defined, it does not account for the reverse order. On the other hand, in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, the `Float` and `Integer` classes do have `__mul__` methods that handle multiplication with numbers. However, there's no specific handling for reverse multiplication with instances of the `Point` class. This asymmetry could be addressed by either implementing an `__rmul__` method in the `Point` class or by ensuring that the multiplication methods in `sympy/core/numbers.py` handle interaction with `Point` objects uniformly.",
