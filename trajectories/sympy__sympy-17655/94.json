Specifically, `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `GeometryError`. This suggests that the issue lies in how the multiplication between a number and a `Point` object is handled.\n\nFrom the provided search results, we can identify the relevant code spans:\n1. The `Point` class definition in `sympy/geometry/point.py`.\n2. The `__add__` method in the `Point` class, which handles the addition of two `Point` objects and throws a `GeometryError` if the addition cannot be handled.\n3. The `__mul__` method in the `Point` class, which handles the multiplication of a `Point` object with a factor.\n\nThese code spans are directly related to the operations involved in the reported issue. The `__mul__` method is particularly important as it is the method that handles the multiplication of a `Point` object with a number. The issue seems to stem from the order in which these operations are performed, and the `__mul__` method's handling of the multiplication will be key to resolving the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, it is clear that the provided search results contain the relevant code spans to address the reported issue.",

This suggests that the issue might not be directly related to the multiplication logic but rather how the __add__ method handles the multiplication result. The Point class's __mul__ method is implemented to handle multiplication with a factor, and it simplifies the multiplication of each coordinate by the factor. The exception message 'Don't know how to add 2.0*Point2D(1, 1) and a Point object' indicates that the __add__ method does not recognize the multiplied Point object correctly.
