The expected behavior is for both orders of multiplication to yield the same result. The analysis of the search results led to the identification of several relevant code spans. Specifically, the __mul__ method in the Point class seems to handle multiplication by a factor, converting it to a sympified factor and then applying it to each coordinate. Additionally, various classes in sympy/core/numbers.py (such as Number, Float, Rational, Integer, Infinity, NegativeInfinity, and NaN) have their own __mul__ methods, which would be invoked in the context of the multiplication operation. However, the specific issue reported seems to be about the compatibility and interaction between these multiplication methods and the Point class's __add__ method. The error indicates that the Point class's __add__ method cannot handle the result of the multiplication involving a Point object directly. Relevant code spans have been identified to address this issue.",
