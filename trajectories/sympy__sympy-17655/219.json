The issue can be replicated with the provided code snippet, where multiplying a Point object by a number using `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but reversing the order to `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError`. This suggests that the current implementation of the `__mul__` method in the `Point` class is not commutative, leading to the observed behavior.\n\nUpon examination of the provided search results, the relevant portions are the implementations of `__add__` and `__mul__` methods within the `Point` class in the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file. The `__mul__` method correctly handles multiplication by a factor and returns a new `Point` object with scaled coordinates. However, the issue arises when the multiplication order is reversed, which is not directly handled by the current implementation. To resolve the issue, the `__rmul__` method should be implemented in the `Point` class to support commutative multiplication.",
