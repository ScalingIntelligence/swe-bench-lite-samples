The error occurs specifically when the multiplication order is reversed, suggesting that the __rmul__ method might not be properly implemented or handled for the Point class. To address this, it is crucial to investigate the implementation of the __mul__ and __rmul__ methods in both the Point class and the associated number classes (like Float and Rational). Additionally, examining the GeometryEntity class for potential issues with how it handles reverse multiplication could be beneficial.",

The search results provide insights into the relevant code spans within the sympy/geometry/point.py and sympy/geometry/entity.py files. The __mul__ method for Point objects is identified as handling the multiplication of a Point by a factor, which is relevant to the issue. Additionally, the GeometryEntity class, which Point inherits from, includes the __rmul__ method, suggesting that this is the likely location for the error when trying to reverse multiply a Point object with a number. Furthermore, the _eval_subs method in GeometryEntity potentially involves checks or conversions that may relate to the issue, particularly if it handles interactions between different types like numbers and Point objects. The Float and Rational classes in sympy/core/numbers.py define their own __rmul__ and __mul__ methods, which could also be relevant if the number being used in the multiplication is a Float or Rational, though these classes do not directly handle GeometryEntity or Point objects.",

The exception occurs when the number is on the left side of the multiplication with the Point object. The expected behavior is for both multiplication orders to yield the same result.\n\n2. Reviewed the current file context: The current context shows the implementations of `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods in the `Point` and `GeometryEntity` classes.\n\n3. Processed new search results: Examined the new search results that include implementations for `__mul__`, `__add__`, and other arithmetic operations in the `Number`, `Float`, and `Rational` classes. Notably, the `Float` and `Rational` classes do not override the `__rmul__` method, which might be relevant since the issue involves the behavior of mixed type operations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the current search results do not directly address the issue of handling `__rmul__` for the `Float` or `Number` types when multiplying a `Point` object. Additional code or context might be needed to understand how to handle these cases. The provided code, however, gives insight into how floating-point and rational number multiplications are handled, which might indirectly inform a solution when combined with the point class methods.\n\n4. Conclusion: Given the provided context and search results, the task is not yet complete as the specific issue of handling number * Point multiplication where `Point.__rmul__` is expected to be defined or utilized differently, is not directly addressed in the search results. Further investigation or modification in the Point class or in the handling of `__rmul__` for numbers might be required.",
