Specifically, the error occurs when trying to multiply a Point object by a number using sympy.sympify, and it fails due to the order of operations. The error messages suggest that the Point class methods __add__ and __mul__ are being called in an unexpected way. To address this, it's necessary to investigate the Point class's __mul__ and __rmul__ methods, as well as the usage of sympy.sympify in these operations.\n\nTo narrow down the search, focus on the following: \n1. The Point class and its methods in sympy.geometry.\n2. The behavior of sympy.sympify in the context of multiplication and addition operations.\n3. The reverse multiplication (__rmul__) in the context of geometry entities and numbers.",

However, when the situation reverses, the __rmul__ method from the GeometryEntity class is invoked, which in turn calls the __mul__ method of the number. This sequence seems to fail because the operation is not symmetric in handling Points versus numbers.\n\nTo resolve this, it's crucial to explore if and how sympy.sympify modifies inputs specifically for the reverse multiplication (__rmul__) context, focusing on scenarios where a Point object is on the right side of the multiplication operation with a number.

        "message": "The analysis of the provided file context reveals several critical points relevant to the issue we are addressing. First, it's evident from the `Point` class in sympy/geometry/point.py that the class definition itself involves `sympify` method calls in several dunder methods such as `__add__`, `__div__`, `__mul__`, and `__neg__`. This indicates that `sympify` is directly involved in how Point objects interact mathematically, which aligns with our initial focus on `sympify`'s role in transformations.\n\nSecond, the `GeometryEntity` class in sympy/geometry/entity.py contributes understanding by defining the `__rmul__` method that redirects to the `__mul__` of its operand. This behavior is significant, especially when considering how it might interact in operations involving `Point` objects and numbers, where 'reversed' operations could activate unintended pathways.\n\nThird, the `Number` and its subclasses (`Float` and `Rational`) within sympy/core/numbers.py provide a deeper understanding of how numeric types might interact with geometry objects after `sympify`. Notably, they all implement `__mul__`, which allows for multiplication between numbers, including after they might have been sympified. This implementation suggests a direct path of investigation including method-level traces of `sympify` and its impact on operand behaviors.\n\nTaking these points into consideration, it becomes clear that within the currently scoped files, we have found significant interactions involving `sympify` and operations relating to both `Point` and numeric types, directly addressing our research interest. This discovery suggests that further detailed inspection of these interactions could yield findings crucial to understanding and solving the presented issue.",
