The error specifically occurs when multiplying in a certain order (`sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`) which raises a `GeometryError`. To resolve this, it's important to understand how the `__mul__`, `__rmul__`, and `__add__` methods are implemented in the `Point` class and related classes. Focusing on `sympy/geometry/point.py` and other related files where these methods are defined should help in identifying the root cause.",

The issue suggests that the operation should be commutative, but an exception is raised. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the multiplication and addition operations for `geometry.Point`. The search results provide relevant code spans in `sympy/geometry/point.py` for `Point.__add__` and `Point.__mul__`. The `Point.__add__` method attempts to normalize dimensions and catch type errors, raising a `GeometryError` if the addition cannot be performed. The `Point.__mul__` methodhandles multiplication by a factor, applying it to each coordinate of the point. These methods are central to understanding and resolving the issue, as they directly deal with the operations in question.",
