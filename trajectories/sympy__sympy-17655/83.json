Specifically, the issue arises when attempting to multiply the number by the point, which results in a `TypeError`. The search results provided include the `Point` class definition from `sympy/geometry/point.py` and the `GeometryEntity` class definition from `sympy/geometry/entity.py`. The relevant methods identified from the search results are `Point.__add__`, `Point.__mul__`, and `GeometryEntity.__rmul__`. The `Point.__add__` method is encountered during the addition operation and handles exceptions when the types are not compatible. The `Point.__mul__` method is responsible for multiplying the point by a factor, but it does not handle the situation when the multiplication order is reversed (number * point). The `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` method is intended to handle operations like this, but it seems to be missing or improperly implemented in the search results for the `Point` class. Given these observations, the relevant code spans are those related to the `Point` class and its methods for addition and multiplication, as well as the `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` method to ensure proper handling of reverse multiplication operations.",

Given the reference to specific methods in the Point class and the inclusion of a related method in the GeometryEntity class, it seems that all relevant code for investigating and potentially fixing the issue is present in the file context. Further code within the Point class, such as `__new__`, `are_coplanar`, and others, also touch upon aspects related to dimension handling and manipulation, which could indirectly be involved in the specific exception scenario described.
