            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves an unexpected exception when trying to multiply instances of sympy's Point class with numbers in different orders. The user expects both `point1 + 2.0 * point2` and `point1 + point2 * 2.0` operations to yield the same results without exceptions.\n\nThis issue seems to be rooted in how the Point class methods handle or don't handle addition and multiplication, particularly with differently ordered operations. Reviewing the `__add__()` method in the Point class shows it raises a `GeometryError` when it doesn't know how to add the objects. This occurs because `sympy.sympify(2.0)` is treated differently when on the right side of the multiplication (as `Point2D(1, 1) * 2.0`) versus the left (`2.0 * Point2D(1, 1)` which fails).\n\nThe `__rmul__()` method in `GeometryEntity`, the base class for `Point`, redirects back to the `__mul__()` method of the left operand, which in this case is `Float` (from 'core/numbers.py'). Thus, the error might be arising due to the difference in the internal handling of numeric types and geometry entities.\n\nTherefore, examining the `__add__` and `__rmul__` methods in `point.py` and `entity.py` is crucial. Also, understanding how the `Float` and other numeric types handle multiplication may provide insights into why one form works while the other doesn't, potentially leading to corrections or adjustments needed in either the numeric handling or the geometry classes.\n\nGiven these insights, the relevant code spans are those that delve into the mathematics and object behaviors involved in these operations, necessitating exploration and possible adjustment to ensure consistent behavior whether the numeric value precedes or follows the geometric entity in multiplication operations.",
