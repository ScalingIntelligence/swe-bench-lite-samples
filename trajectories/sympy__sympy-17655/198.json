Specifically, the line `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a TypeError. This discrepancy suggests that the order of operations in multiplication with Point objects might not be handled as expected. The stack trace points to the `__add__` method in `sympy/geometry/point.py` as the source of the error, indicating that the method fails to handle multiplication of a Point object with a number in a specific order. To resolve this, it's necessary to investigate the `__mul__`, `__rmul__`, and `__add__` methods in the `Point` class and possibly related classes to ensure consistent handling of these operations.",
