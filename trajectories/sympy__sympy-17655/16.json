This can be due to the order of operations in the multiplication affecting how the __mul__ and __rmul__ methods are called. Specifically, the difference between `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` and `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` suggests a need to examine the implementation of these methods in the Point class and its interaction with sympy's number classes. Additionally, the error suggests that the Point class may not be handling a specific type of input (a Mul object) correctly in its __add__ method. Therefore, focusing on the Point class in the geometry module and the handling of multiplication and addition in sympy's number classes will be key to resolving the issue.",

The following spans are relevant:\n- `Number.__mul__`: Defines how the Number class handles multiplication, which is a base class for Float and Rational.\n- `Float.__mul__`: Specific handling for multiplication involving Float objects.\n- `Rational.__mul__`: Specific handling for multiplication involving Rational objects.\n\nThese code spans cover the core operations involved in the reported issue, providing a comprehensive view of how Point objects, Numbers, Floats, and Rationals interact and handle multiplication and addition.
