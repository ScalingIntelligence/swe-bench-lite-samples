The exception occurs specifically when the multiplication order is reversed, leading to different behaviors. This indicates a potential issue with how the Point class handles reversed multiplication via the __rmul__ method. The provided search results contain the Point class and its methods, including __mul__ and __rmul__. The __mul__ method in the Point class is responsible for multiplying a Point by a factor, which involves transforming the coordinates. Since the issue occurs with reversed multiplication, examining the handling of __rmul__ in the context of GeometryEntity might be pertinent. However, the search results do not directly include the __rmul__ method within the Point class, instead finding it in the GeometryEntity class, suggesting that the Point class inherits this behavior. This discrepancy in handling reversed multiplication could be the root cause of the reported issue. The relevant code spans to investigate are those handling multiplication and reversed multiplication for the Point class.",
