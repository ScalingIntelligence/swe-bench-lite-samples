Specifically, the error occurs when the multiplication is performed in a specific order (number * Point) rather than the other way around (Point * number). This issue is likely related to the handling of the Point objects in the __add__ method and possibly in the __mul__ method. The relevant code spans identified from the search results include the __mul__ method for the Point class and the __mul__ method for the Number class. These methods are crucial for understanding how multiplication operations are handled for Point and Number objects in sympy. Additionally, examining the __add__ method within the Point class is important to understand how addition operations involving Point objects are handled, as this is a likely source of the reported exception. These methods provide a comprehensive view of the operations involved in the reported issue and directly address the exception being raised.",
