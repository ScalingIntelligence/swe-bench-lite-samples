            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue of an unexpected exception when multiplying `geometry.Point` and a number in reverse order, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the multiplication and addition of `Point` objects. The issue specifically mentions problems with the following operations:\n\n- `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine.\n- `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises an exception.\n\nThe exception occurs in the `__add__` method of the `Point` class when attempting to add a `Mul` object to a `Point` object. This implies that the `__rmul__` method, which handles right multiplication, is likely missing or insufficient. We need to examine the `__rmul__` method in both the `Point` class and its parent class `GeometryEntity`.\n\nFrom the provided search results, we can see the following relevant code spans:\n\n1. In `sympy/geometry/point.py`:\n   - `Point.__add__`: This method is where the exception is being raised.\n   - `Point.__mul__`: This method handles multiplication of a `Point` object by a factor.\n\n2. In `sympy/geometry/entity.py`:\n   - `GeometryEntity.__rmul__`: This method should handle the right multiplication of a `Point` object by a factor, but it is not implemented.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The `Point.__add__` method is correctly trying to normalize dimensions and add two `Point` objects. However, it fails when `other` is not a `Point` object, leading to a `GeometryError`.\n- The `Point.__mul__` method correctly handles multiplication of a `Point` object by a factor, but there is no corresponding `__rmul__` method in the `Point` class itself.\n\nSince the `GeometryEntity` class is the parent class of `Point`, it is a likely place to look for the implementation of `__rmul__`. However, the provided search results show that `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` does not exist, leading to the assumption that `__rmul__` needs to be implemented.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The relevant code spans are in the `Point.__add__` and `Point.__mul__` methods in `sympy/geometry/point.py`.\n- There is a missing `__rmul__` method in either `GeometryEntity` or `Point` classes that should handle the reverse multiplication.\n\nTo resolve the issue, one possible solution is to implement a `__rmul__` method in the `Point` class that delegates to the existing `__mul__` method.",

This could potentially cause issues if the left operand does not properly support such an operation with a `Point` object.\n\nTo address the issue, two primary actions should be taken: first, ensure that the `__rmul__` method in the `GeometryEntity` class is appropriately handling the operation with `Point`, adjusting as necessary to match expected behavior or correctness. Second, given that specific operation failures (such as during addition after a reverse multiplication) are detailed, similar checks should be in place for these operations within the `Point` class to maintain expected behavior.\n\nAdditionally, examining tests or creating new tests specifically focused on the interaction of reverse multiplication with other operations and entities could provide more insight into the behaviors and potential bugs or edge cases to address.",

This suggests that the __rmul__ method in the Point class or its base class GeometryEntity might be missing or not implemented correctly. From the search results, we can see that the Point class implements the __mul__ method, but there is no explicit implementation of the __rmul__ method in the Point class or its base class GeometryEntity. The GeometryEntity class has an __rmul__ method, but it is not necessarily implemented for the Point class specifically. This discrepancy could be the reason for the exception. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue would be the __mul__ method in the Point class and the __rmul__ method in the GeometryEntity class, as well as any additional methods involved in handling the reverse multiplication operation for Point objects. However, addressing the issue may also require implementing or modifying the __rmul__ method in the Point class to ensure correct handling of the reverse multiplication operation.",
