The issue arises specifically when the multiplication order is reversed, leading to a `TypeError` and then a `GeometryError`. Upon reviewing the search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are primarily in `sympy/geometry/point.py`. The method `Point.__mul__` defines how a Point instance should be multiplied by a factor, but there is no corresponding definition for reverse multiplication (`__rmul__`). This oversight seems to be the root cause of the issue since Python's default behavior when an object does not support reverse multiplication is to attempt the reverse operation, which can fail if not explicitly defined. Therefore, the missing `__rmul__` method in the `Point` class is the critical part needed to resolve this issue. While `sympy/core/numbers.py` contains various number type definitions and their multiplication methods, these are not directly causing the error but are contextually relevant for understanding how numbers interact with `Point` objects. No additional relevant code spans are found outside of `sympy/geometry/point.py` for this specific issue.",
