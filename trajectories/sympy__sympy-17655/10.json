The exception occurs due to the order of operations in the multiplication, which is not handled correctly by the `Point` class.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code spans are found in `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py`. In `sympy/geometry/point.py`, the `Point.__mul__` method handles multiplication of a `Point` by a factor. However, this method does not handle cases where the `Point` is on the right-hand side of the multiplication, which seems to be the issue here. Similarly, in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, the `Number.__mul__` method handles multiplication for `Number` instances, but it does not account for the interaction with `Point` instances. This could be the reason why attempting to multiply a `Number` by a `Point` results in an exception. The `Point` class does not define an `__rmul__` method to handle right-hand side multiplications, which might need to be implemented to resolve the reported issue.",

The provided context includes multiple files from the sympy library, mainly focusing on classes related to geometry, core arithmetic, matrices, and sequences. The main areas of interest are the Point class in sympy/geometry/point.py and the MatrixArithmetic, NDimArray, and SeqBase classes in their respective files. The goal is to identify where the order of operations affects the multiplication of Point objects and numbers. In the Point class, we can see methods for addition (__add__), division (__div__), multiplication (__mul__), and negation (__neg__). The multiplication method (__mul__) seems to handle the multiplication of a Point object with a factor, but it does not account for the order of operations leading to a TypeError. Additionally, the addition method (__add__) handles the addition of two Point objects, but it does not handle well the combination of a Point object with a multiplicative expression involving another Point object, which is needed to address the issue described.

Specifically, looking into the core expression evaluation, such as `sympy/core/expr.py`, which might define the order of operations handling for expressions, or `sympy/core/mul.py`, which is likely involved in how multiplication operations are processed and how they interact with other elements like Point objects.

Specifically, the issue arises when the number is multiplied before the Point object in the expression. The expected behavior is that both expressions `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` and `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` should give the same result. The current implementation in `sympy/geometry/point.py` includes methods for `__add__`, `__div__`, `__mul__`, and `__neg__` for the Point class. However, the exception occurs because the `__mul__` method does not handle the case where a number is multiplied by a Point object correctly. The search results include relevant code spans in `sympy/core/expr.py`, `sympy/core/mul.py`, and `sympy/core/numbers.py`. In particular, `Expr.__mul__`, `Mul.flatten`, `Number.__mul__`, and `Float.__mul__` methods are relevant as they deal with multiplication operations involving expressions and numbers.
