The expected behavior is that both orders of multiplication should yield the same result. The search results provided include relevant code spans from `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py`. In `sympy/geometry/point.py`, the `__mul__` method of the `Point` class is defined, and in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, several classes like `Number`, `Float`, and `Rational` contain their own `__mul__` methods. These methods define the multiplication behavior for different types of numbers. Given that the issue occurs when a `Point` object is multiplied with a `sympified` number, it suggests an issue with the interaction between these classes. The current implementation of the `__mul__` method in the `Point` class is directly relevant to the issue, as it deals with the multiplication of a `Point` instance with a factor. The code spans from `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py` are likely relevant to addressing this issue.",

The provided file context already includes relevant code spans from `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py`, which define the `Point` class and various number types, including their multiplication methods. The new search results provide additional context, such as the `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` method and the `Integer.__rmul__` method, which are relevant for understanding the right-multiplication behavior. These additional methods are crucial for understanding how the system might handle the reversed order multiplication. Specifically, the `__rmul__` methods in `Integer` and `Expr` classes indicate how the system tries to handle the multiplication when the number is on the left-hand side, which is directly related to the issue at hand.
