The relevant code spans to investigate are those related to the Point class, specifically the __add__ and __mul__ methods, which handle addition and multiplication operations involving Point objects. The error message indicates that the TypeError is raised when the Point class tries to normalize dimensions during addition, suggesting that the problem might be in how the __add__ method handles its arguments.

The expected behavior is for both 'point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)' and 'point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2' to yield the same result. The traceback indicates that the error occurs within the '__add__' method of the Point class, where it fails to handle the multiplication of a Point object with a number correctly. To address this issue, it is necessary to review the '__mul__' method in the Point class to ensure it correctly handles scalar multiplication and then update the '__add__' method to appropriately handle the addition of a Point object with a scalar multiple of another Point object. From the search results, the relevant code spans include the '__mul__' method which is responsible for handling multiplication operations involving Point objects, and the '__add__' method which should be updated to handle the addition of a Point object with a scalar multiple of another Point object.",
