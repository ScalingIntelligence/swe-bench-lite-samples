The issue describes that `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympify.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises an exception. The exception details suggest that the problem lies in the handling of the multiplication operation when the order is reversed. Given the search results, the `Point.__mul__` method defines how a `Point` object should be multiplied by a factor. However, this method may not handle the reverse order of multiplication, which is causing the exception.
