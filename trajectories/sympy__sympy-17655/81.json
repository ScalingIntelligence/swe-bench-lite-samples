Specifically, the exception occurs when trying to multiply a sympy.sympify(2.0) with a Point object, which raises a GeometryError. The key elements identified from the issue are the Point class from sympy.geometry and the multiplication operation (__mul__). The current context is empty, so we need to identify the relevant code spans from the provided search results that pertain to the Point class and the multiplication operation. The search results show three distinct Point classes across different modules: sympy/geometry/point.py, sympy/vector/point.py, and sympy/physics/vector/point.py. Given the error message and the nature of the issue (involving geometry operations), the most relevant module seems to be 'sympy/geometry/point.py'. Within this module, the spans that are particularly relevant are those that deal with the Point class and its multiplication operation, specifically the '__mul__' method and the '_normalize_dimension' method, which is used in the '__add__' method where the TypeError is raised. The '__mul__' method in 'sympy/geometry/point.py' is directly related to the multiplication operation described in the issue. Therefore, these spans should be identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
