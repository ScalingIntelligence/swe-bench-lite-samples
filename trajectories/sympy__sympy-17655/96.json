The error traces back to sympy.geometry.point.Point's __add__ method, suggesting that the method might not handle the composition of operations involving Point, Mul, and Number instances correctly. To address this, we need to investigate the __mul__ and __add__ methods in classes related to Point, Number, and their interaction within the SymPy library. Given the context provided with code snippets and the preliminary files, we can start by focusing on the sympy/geometry/point.py and sympy/core/numbers.py files, as well as other classes where multiplication and addition are defined, such as sympy/core/mul.py and sympy/matrices/common.py. Additionally, it may be beneficial to check how sympy.sympify(2.0) interacts with the Point class, looking for any discrepancies in handling these operations.",

Additionally, the __mul__ method in the Point class is defined but does not address the specific order of operations that led to the TypeError in the issue (i.e., Float * Point). The search results from sympy/core/sympify.py include the sympify function and related methods, which are relevant for converting Python objects to SymPy objects.

To confirm this and to explore potential solutions, it's crucial to see how sympy.sympify and the Point class interact, especially looking into how sympy.sympify transforms the number 2.0.
