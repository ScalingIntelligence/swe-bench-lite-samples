The specific lines in question are:\n\n```python\npoint1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)\n```\nand\n```python\npoint1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2\n```\n\nThe first line works, but the second raises a TypeError and a GeometryError. This suggests an asymmetry in how multiplication and addition are handled. The error indicates that the Point class's `__add__` method does not know how to handle the multiplication result, specifically an expression like `2.0 * Point2D(1, 1)`. This asymmetry might stem from the `__mul__` method in the Point class or the interaction with `sympy.sympify(2.0)` or its underlying Number or Float class's `__mul__` method.\n\nGiven the traceback, the relevant files are likely in the sympy/geometry directory, specifically point.py, and possibly in core regarding the multiplication handling. The search should focus on these areas, specifically looking at the `__add__`, `__mul__`, and `__rmul__` methods in the Point class and any associated classes like Number or Float.",
