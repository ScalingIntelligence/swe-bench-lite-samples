The user provided examples where multiplication works one way but raises an exception when performed in reverse order. The key points to focus on are the `__add__` and `__mul__` methods in the `sympy.geometry.point.Point` class, as these methods are likely to be involved in handling the operations. The `__add__` method attempts to normalize dimensions and handles `TypeError`, while the `__mul__` method handles multiplication by a factor. The error suggests that there's an issue in how the `__add__` method interprets the multiplication result when the order is reversed. It's crucial to identify the sections of code that deal with adding points and multiplying them by a factor to understand why the exception occurs and how to address it.",
