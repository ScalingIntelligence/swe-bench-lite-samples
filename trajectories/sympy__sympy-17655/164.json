Specifically, the exception occurs during the addition of a point and the result of multiplying a point by `sympify(2.0)`. The key elements identified in the issue are the `Point` class and its methods like `__mul__`. In the provided search results, the `Point` class definition and its `__mul__` method are found in the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file. The `__mul__` method defines how a point can be multiplied by a factor, which is relevant to the issue as it involves multiplication of a point. Therefore, the code span containing the `__mul__` method in the `Point` class is considered relevant. Additionally, as the issue involves an exception during addition, further examination of the `__add__` method in the `Point` class might be necessary to fully address the problem. Given the provided search results, the identified code span is sufficient to understand the multiplication operation on a `Point`. However, to fully address the reported issue, it might be necessary to also examine the `__add__` method and how it handles types during addition.",
