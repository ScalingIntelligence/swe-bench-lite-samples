The key elements in the reported issue are the Point class, the __add__ and __mul__ methods of this class, and the sympify function. From the search results, I see that the Point class is located in 'sympy/geometry/point.py', and it has implementations for both __add__ and __mul__ methods. Additionally, in 'sympy/core/numbers.py', there are relevant code spans that involve the Number class and its subclasses (like Float and Rational), especially their __mul__ methods, which could also play a role in the issue since sympify converts the input into a SymPy object. Furthermore, 'sympy/geometry/entity.py' contains the GeometryEntity class which has an __rmul__ method, which deals with right multiplication, potentially relevant to the reported issue since the error arises when the operation is done in reverse order. Identifying these spans is crucial as they directly deal with the operations and type handling related to the Point class and Numbers, which are central to the reported issue. Therefore, all these code spans should be considered relevant to understanding and possibly addressing the issue.",

This is likely due to the incorrect indentation of the `__rmul__` method, which should be indented to be part of the `Point` class. Additionally, there is an undefined variable '__div__'. However, since Python 3 no longer uses '__div__' and instead uses '__truediv__', this should not cause issues in actual code execution but might be flagged by some linting tools. The lint error for bad operand type for unary - suggests that the `_neg_` method is missing from the `Point` class.
