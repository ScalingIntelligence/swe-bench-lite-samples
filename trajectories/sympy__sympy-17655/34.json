The specific operations `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` does not, suggesting a problem with the reverse multiplication operation. Given the error trace and the context of the operations, it's clear that the `__rmul__` method for the Point class might be missing or not implemented correctly. To confirm this, we need to search for the `Point` class and its methods, especially focusing on `__mul__` and `__rmul__`.",

The expected behavior is for both multiplication orders to yield the same result. From the search results, the relevant code span to look at is the `__mul__` method within the `Point` class in `sympy/geometry/point.py`. This method is responsible for handling multiplication operations on Point objects. The method attempts to multiply each coordinate of the Point by a given factor, but it does not handle the case where the Point object is the second operand in the multiplication (when the order is reversed). This is likely the cause of the exception seen in the reported issue. Further investigation or modification of this method to handle both orders of multiplication would be necessary to resolve the issue.",

The user observes different outcomes when executing 'point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)' vs 'point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2'. The first expression works, while the second raises a TypeError and a GeometryError. The current file context and search results indicate that the issue may be related to the Point class and its arithmetic operations, particularly the __mul__ method. The search results include various special methods of the Point class, confirming that the Point class handles multiplication and addition differently, which could be the root cause of the issue. The search also reveals the Expr class, which may be involved in the multiplication operation due to its various arithmetic methods. Further investigation into how these classes interact during multiplication operations is needed to resolve the issue. It's also important to note that the methods listed in the Point class have not been listed here, so it's crucial to have a complete view of the class before making a final decision.",
