The user observed that `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError`. This discrepancy suggests a potential problem with the handling of the multiplication operation in conjunction with the addition operation for `geometry.Point` objects. Given the search results, it's evident that relevant methods within the `geometry.Point` class, namely `__add__` and `__mul__`, are handling operations with points and factors. The exception traces back to the `__add__` method, where it fails to handle the case when the `other` operand is a `Mul` object. The `__mul__` method, on the other hand, successfully multiplies the coordinates of the point by a factor. The issue likely arises from the sequence of operations and how `__add__` method interprets the type of `other` when it is a result of multiplication.",

The provided context contains the `Point` class and its `__add__` and `__mul__` methods in `sympy/geometry/point.py`. The search results include additional methods from the `Point` class such as `__div__`, `__neg__`, and class methods like `are_coplanar`, `evalf`, `intersection`, `is_concyclic`, `midpoint`, properties like `origin`, `orthogonal_direction`, and subclasses like `Point2D` and `Point3D`. However, the critical methods remain `__add__` and `__mul__`. In the `GeometryEntity` class in `sympy/geometry/entity.py`, there is also an `__rmul__` method which might be relevant for understanding the right-multiplication context.\n\nAfter analyzing the code, it is clear that the `__add__` method in `Point` raises a `GeometryError` when it encounters an object it doesn't know how to add to a `Point`, which matches the reported exception. The solution might involve handling the multiplication order or ensuring that the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods are symmetric in their handling. The `__rmul__` method does not override `__mul__` directly but rather delegates back, which is standard in Python for commutative operations.\n\nFor completeness, it would be beneficial to include the entire `__add__` method, the `__mul__` method, and potentially the `__rmul__` method in the identified spans to fully address the reported issue.",
