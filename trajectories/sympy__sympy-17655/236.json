The key elements identified from the issue are the `Point` class and its methods, particularly those related to arithmetic operations like `__add__`, `__mul__`, and `_normalize_dimension`. The exception traceback points to the `__add__` method in `sympy.geometry.point.py`, specifically the section where it tries to handle the addition of a `Point` object and another object that is not a `Point`. This suggests that the error might be due to the sequence of operations or the way the objects are being handled during arithmetic operations. The search results include the `Point` class with methods such as `__mul__` and `_normalize_dimension`, which are directly related to the issue. Additionally, the `Mul` class in `sympy.core.mul.py` is relevant as it deals with multiplication operations which are central to the issue at hand. It is crucial to inspect how the `__mul__` method of the `Point` class is implemented and how it interacts with other types of objects, especially numbers. The `_normalize_dimension` method is also critical as it is called within the `__add__` method to handle dimension normalization, which might be throwing a `TypeError` if the objects being added are not handled correctly. The presence of these methods in the search results indicates that the relevant sections of the codebase have been identified, and further analysis of these methods should provide insight into the root cause of the issue.",
