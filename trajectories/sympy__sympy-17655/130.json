To address this, I need to find the relevant code spans handling multiplication with Point objects and ensure they correctly handle the order of operations and types of operands. The issue might be related to how '__rmul__' or '__mul__' methods are defined for Point objects or possibly how sympify converts numbers. From the current context and search results, I focused on the '__mul__' and '__rmul__' methods for Point and GeometryEntity. Additionally, I need to check if there are any specific handling or type checks missing in the 'Point' class methods that deal with multiplication.
