Specifically, the issue arises when the multiplication is performed in a certain order. The user expects both multiplication orders to yield the same result, but one order raises a `TypeError`. The relevant code spans should include the `__mul__` method in the `Point` class within `sympy/geometry/point.py` and any related multiplication methods in other parts of the codebase that might handle the multiplication between a `Point` and a number. Given the issue description, the initial focus should be on the `__mul__` method of the `Point` class and any potential related methods or classes involved in the multiplication operation.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans identified are located within `sympy/geometry/point.py`. Specifically, the `Point.__mul__` span contains the `__mul__` method for the `Point` class, which handles the multiplication operation. This method is the most relevant to the reported issue as it directly pertains to the multiplication of a `Point` object with another object, which in this case is a number. Additionally, the `Number.__mul__` and `Float.__mul__` methods in `sympy/core/numbers.py` are also potentially relevant as they handle multiplication involving numbers, which may interact with the `Point` class during the operation. Other spans related to multiplication operations in different parts of the codebase are less directly relevant to the reported issue but could provide additional context or insight into SymPy's handling of multiplication in various contexts.

The exception is raised when attempting to add a Point object to a result of multiplying a Point by a sympified number, specifically when the multiplication result is on the right side of the addition. To address this, we need to look into the __add__ method of the Point class and potentially modify its behavior to handle the multiplication results correctly. The provided file context points to the __mul__ method already implemented for the Point class. However, it does not show the __add__ method in the context, which raises exceptions for unsupported types. The search results provide the __add__ method for different classes, which might not directly apply to the Point class but could offer insights. Notably, the __add__ method in the interval class handles addition with different types, suggesting a potential approach. The MatrixArithmetic class also implements an __add__ method designed to handle matrix operations, indicating how addition could be managed for classes with specific contexts. The NDimArray class provides an example of handling addition for arrays, which could also be relevant given the vector-like nature of points. While these examples do not directly apply to the Point class, they offer valuable patterns and methodologies for handling addition. Additionally, the Integer class in the numbers module showcases type handling for addition and other operations, which is relevant given that the issue involves numerical operations on points.",
