The issue specifically occurs when attempting to multiply a sympified number with a Point object, whereas the reverse operation does not raise an exception. This discrepancy suggests a potential bug or inconsistency in how the __mul__ or __add__ methods are implemented for Point objects and other number types in sympy.\n\nFrom the provided search results, I have identified the following relevant code:\n1. The `Point.__add__` method from sympy/geometry/point.py which handles the addition of two Point objects and raises a TypeError if the addition is not possible.\n2. The `Point.__mul__` method from sympy/geometry/point.py which handles the multiplication of a Point object by a factor. Both of these methods are directly related to the operations reported in the issue.\n3. Additional relevant code spans include the __mul__ methods for `Number`, `Float`, `Rational`, and `Integer` classes from sympy/core/numbers.py, as these methods define how basic numerical types interact with each other, which might be relevant to understanding how the multiplication between a Point object and a number fails.\n\nBased on the analysis, I have identified the necessary code spans from the search results to address the reported issue.
