The issue occurs specifically when trying to multiply the point by a sympified number in a certain order. The traceback indicates that the problem is in the `__add__` and `__new__` methods of the `Point` class within `sympy/geometry/point.py`. The key takeaway from the traceback is the `GeometryError` raised when the system doesn't know how to add 'Mul' and a Point object. To address this issue, it's crucial to identify the handling of multiplication and addition in the `Point` class. The code spans identified contain the `__new__`, `__add__`, and `__mul__` methods of the `Point` class, which are directly relevant to creating, adding, and multiplying points. These methods will need to be inspected and potentially adjusted to ensure that the multiplication of a Point object by a sympified number works correctly regardless of the order of multiplication.",
