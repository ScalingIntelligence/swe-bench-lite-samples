This discrepancy occurs specifically in the __add__ method of the Point class which fails to handle the case where the multiplication order is reversed. To resolve this, we need to investigate how the __rmul__ method is defined for Point objects and if it interacts correctly with the __add__ method. Additionally, the expected behavior of the code snippet should be that both expressions produce the same result. This involves understanding the interaction between Point objects and sympy.Number types during arithmetic operations.",

Specifically, the multiplication works when `Point` is on the left but fails when `Point` is on the right. This suggests an asymmetry in how `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods are implemented for `Point`. \n\nUpon reviewing the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file, we find the `Point.__mul__` method, which handles multiplication of a Point by a factor. This method uses `sympify(factor)` and multiplies each coordinate by this factor. Given the error occurs with the reverse multiplication (number * Point), we should check if `Point` has a `__rmul__` method. Standard Python behavior would fallback to `__mul__` if `__rmul__` is missing, but checking both helps ensure consistent behavior regardless of argument order.\n\nThe relevant spans identified are `Point.__mul__` and possibly the entire `Point` class to understand if any other methods may interfere or assist in solving this issue.",

The error occurs in the __add__ method of the Point class, where it fails to handle the case where 'other' is not a Point object, leading to a GeometryError. The relevant code spans identified in the file_context include the __add__, __mul__, and __new__ methods of the Point and Point2D classes. These methods are crucial for understanding how point objects are added and multiplied. In the new search results, the __mul__ method of the Point class is highlighted, which confirms the relevance of this method to the issue at hand. This method is responsible for the multiplication of a point by a factor, which directly relates to the multiplication operation mentioned in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are the __add__ and __mul__ methods of the Point class.",
