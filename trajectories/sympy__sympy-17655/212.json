The user provided an example where `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a TypeError. This indicates a potential issue with how the `__mul__` or `__add__` methods in the Point class handle the multiplication or addition operations when the factor precedes the Point object.\n\nAnalyzing the new search results, we can see that the relevant code spans include `Point.__add__` and `Point.__mul__`. These methods are likely where the error is being triggered. The `__add__` method attempts to normalize the dimensions of the points being added and raises a GeometryError if it doesn't know how to add the two objects. The `__mul__` method multiplies the coordinates of the point by a factor. The exception message and traceback suggest that the error occurs because the method `Point._normalize_dimension` is expecting a sequence of coordinates but receives a `Mul` object instead, which leads to a TypeError. This is further confirmed by the GeometryError message indicating that it doesn't know how to add the specific object types in question.\n\nTherefore, the relevant code spans for addressing the issue are `Point.__add__`, `Point.__mul__`, and the helper method `Point._normalize_dimension` if available in the full codebase, as they are directly involved in the operations that fail.",
