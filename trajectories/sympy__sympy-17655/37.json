Specifically, the line `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError` and a `GeometryError`. This discrepancy indicates a potentially asymmetric implementation of arithmetic operations involving `Point` objects and numbers. The relevant methods to investigate are `__mul__` and `__add__` in the `Point` class, as well as the `__rmul__` method in the `GeometryEntity` class, which `Point` inherits from. Additionally, the `sympify` function's handling of these operations might need to be examined. The primary focus should be on sympy/geometry/point.py and sympy/core/mul.py, as they contain the multiplication logic and the methods involved in the error.",

The error originates from the `__add__` method in the `Point` class, which cannot handle the form of `2.0 * Point2D(1, 1)` properly.

Specifically, the exception occurs when multiplying a sympified number with a Point instance, whereas the reverse order works fine. The issue seems to be related to the handling of Point multiplication and addition operations, particularly in the geometry/point.py file. The search results show code spans that are relevant to the issue, particularly those in the geometry/entity.py and core/mul.py files. The identified code spans include methods related to addition and multiplication (like __radd__, __rdiv__, __rmul__, and __rsub__ in GeometryEntity) and the Mul class in the core/mul.py file, which is expected to handle multiplication operations in SymPy. These spans are directly or indirectly related to the functionality that handles the multiplication of geometrical entities and numbers, which is central to the reported issue. However, the issue specifically involves the ordering of the multiplication operation between a number (sympified) and a Point instance, which is not directly addressed in the provided spans. Thus, while the identified spans are relevant to the broader context of the issue, they might not fully address the specific problem of the ordering of multiplication operations.",

The relevant parts of the codebase to address this issue are primarily in the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file, where the `Point` class and its methods such as `__add__` and `__mul__` are defined. These methods are crucial as they handle the addition and multiplication operations involving `Point` objects. The `TypeError` and `GeometryError` encountered suggest that the `__add__` method is not handling the multiplication of `Point` objects correctly, particularly when the multiplication operation precedes the addition. The provided search results include additional methods from the `GeometryEntity` class in `sympy/geometry/entity.py`, but they do not directly relate to the specific issue involving the multiplication of a `Point` by a number. Therefore, the focus should remain on the `Point` class methods in `sympy/geometry/point.py`.",
