Specifically, the user found that the expression `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a TypeError. This suggests an asymmetry in how sympy handles the multiplication of Point objects and numbers. The search results provided are from the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, which contains definitions and operations for Number classes such as Float, Rational, and Integer. The spans `Number.__mul__`, `Float.__mul__`, and `Rational.__mul__` contain the multiplication logic for these classes. These could be relevant since the issue involves multiplication with a sympy.sympify result, which likely involves these Number classes. Additionally, the `igcd` function and the multiplication logic of the Integer class are also included. These are potentially relevant because they handle mathematical operations that might be involved in the multiplication process. Overall, these spans are relevant to understanding how number types interact and how multiplications are handled in sympy. The issue might be related to how sympy handles the multiplication of Points and non-integer numbers (like floats).",

The issue arises when attempting to multiply `sympy.sympify(2.0)` by `point2`, followed by adding `point1`. The exception indicates that the system doesn't know how to handle the multiplication result and a Point object. Given the context and the search results, it appears that the relevant sections of code to investigate are the `__mul__` methods in both the `Point` class (from `sympy/geometry/point.py`) and the `Number` class (from `sympy/core/numbers.py`). The `Point.__mul__` method specifically handles the multiplication of a Point by a factor, but the error suggests that the system doesn't know how to handle the result of the multiplication by `sympy.sympify(2.0)` followed by addition with another `Point`. This discrepancy needs to be addressed, possibly by adjusting how the multiplication result is managed or how different types of objects interact in the system. Additionally, the `Number.__mul__` method, particularly in the `Float` subclass, should be reviewed to ensure it properly handles interactions with other types, such as `Point`.",
