The exception arises when attempting to multiply a `Point` object by a `sympify` transformed number, rather than multiplying the number by the `Point` object. The current file context shows that the `Point` class has a `__mul__` method defined, which suggests that the multiplication operation should be supported. However, the traceback indicates that the `__add__` method in the `Point` class does not handle the specific case where the argument to add is a `Mul` object, which is what `sympify` returns when multiplying by a number. The search results include the `sympify` function from `sympy/core/sympify.py`, which is likely the source of the transformation applied to the number before attempting to multiply it by the `Point` object. This function is responsible for converting inputs into a form that SymPy can work with, and it includes handling for NumPy types, complex numbers, and other data types. The relevance of these spans to the reported issue lies in understanding how `sympify` transforms the input before it is used in the multiplication operation with the `Point` object. Despite the detailed spans, none of these directly address the specific TypeError raised in the traceback regarding the addition of a `Mul` object to a `Point` object. Therefore, while the `sympify` function and its handling of different types are relevant to understanding the root cause of the issue, additional code spans related to the `Point` class's handling of `Mul` objects in its `__add__` method are needed to fully address the reported issue.",

This could be the root cause of the reported exception when attempting `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`. The provided file context does not include an `__rmul__` method within the `Point` class, which is crucial for understanding how reverse multiplication would be handled. It is also significant to note the influence of `sympify` on operations, particularly since it can alter the types and values involved in multiplication. Further exploration is advisable, particularly into the `__rmul__` method within the `Point` class, to conclusively determine if the context provided covers all relevant code areas.",
