Specifically, the issue arises when attempting to multiply `sympy.sympify(2.0)` by a `Point` object, which results in a `GeometryError`. The key elements to look for in the search results are methods related to arithmetic operations involving `Point` objects, particularly `__mul__` and `__add__`. The relevant code spans should include how `Point` objects handle multiplication and addition with other types, especially when those types are not directly handled by the current implementation. The provided search results include several relevant methods such as `__mul__`, `__add__`, and the `__new__` method where the TypeError is initially raised. These methods are crucial for understanding how points are created and how arithmetic operations are defined for `Point` objects.\n\nThe `__mul__` method is relevant because it defines how a `Point` object should behave when multiplied by a factor, but it does not handle the case where the factor is a `Mul` object explicitly. The `__add__` method is also relevant because it defines how points are added together, and the error handling in this method is what ultimately raises the `GeometryError`. The `__new__` method is relevant for understanding the creation and initialization of `Point` objects and the error handling for invalid coordinate sequences.\n\nThe provided code spans cover the necessary methods and error handling related to the issue, indicating that the search results are relevant and sufficient to address the reported issue.",
