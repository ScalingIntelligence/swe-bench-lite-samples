The user encounters a TypeError when attempting to multiply a Point object by a sympified number and then add it to another Point object. This issue highlights a discrepancy in how the Point class handles these operations depending on the order of operations. The relevant code spans seem to be the __add__ and __mul__ methods within the Point class. The __mul__ method defines how a Point object should be multiplied by a factor, and the __add__ method defines how two Point objects should be added together. The exception occurs in the __add__ method when it tries to normalize the dimensions of the Point objects and encounters a TypeError, likely because it is not correctly handling the multiplication operation as an input for addition. Therefore, the identified spans should include both the __add__ and __mul__ methods to address the issue fully.",
