The issue indicates that the multiplication works fine when the number is on the right side of the point, but fails when the number is on the left side. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with how the __mul__ method is implemented for Point objects or how the __rmul__ method is missing or incorrectly implemented. The search results include relevant code spans from sympy/geometry/point.py that deal with Point operations, specifically the __add__, __mul__, and the handling of dimensional normalization. These code spans are critical for understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.\n\nThe analysis of the search results reveals that the __mul__ method for Point objects is implemented, which suggests it should handle the multiplication correctly when the Point object is on the right side. However, the absence of the __rmul__ method for Point objects means that Python's fallback behavior is triggered when the Point object is on the left side, which likely results in the TypeError. This insight suggests that implementing the __rmul__ method in the Point class could resolve the issue by ensuring symmetric behavior for multiplication operations regardless of the order of the operands.\n\nGiven the identified code spans, focusing on the __mul__ and potentially adding an __rmul__ method in sympy/geometry/point.py should address the issue, ensuring that multiplication operations involving Point objects and numbers are handled consistently and without errors.",
