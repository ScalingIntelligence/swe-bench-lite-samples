The main focus is on understanding why the order of multiplication matters in this context. Specifically, `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises an exception. The relevant code spans to identify would be those related to the implementation of `__mul__` for the `Point` class, and to check if the implementation handles different types or orders of multiplication correctly. Additionally, considering the `TypeError` during the addition operation, it would also be important to review the `__add__` method in the `Point` class.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the following key spans are identified as relevant:\n1. The `Point` class and its `__mul__` method in `sympy/geometry/point.py`. This method deals with the multiplication of a `Point` object by a factor.\n2. The `__mul__` methods in the `Number` subclasses (Float, Rational, Integer, Infinity, NegativeInfinity) in `sympy/core/numbers.py`. These definitions handle multiplication involving different types of numbers and might affect how the `Point` multiplication behaves due to type interactions.\nThese code spans are relevant because they directly address the multiplication operation involved in the issue, and understanding how these methods handle different types of inputs could be crucial to resolving the reported problem.",
