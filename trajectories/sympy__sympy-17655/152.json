This suggests that the issue might be related to the order of operations or the way the `__mul__` method is implemented in the `Point` class. \n\nFrom the provided file context, we can see that the `__mul__` method is already defined in the `Point` class and it multiplies each coordinate of the point by the given factor. However, no special handling is provided for the case where the `Point` object is on the right side of the multiplication operation. \n\nThe new search results confirm the presence of the `__mul__` method, but there is no mention of handling the multiplication where the `Point` object is the right operand, which corresponds to the `__rmul__` method. This suggests that the `__rmul__` method might be missing or not properly implemented, leading to the unexpected behavior when the `Point` object is on the right side of the multiplication. \n\nGiven this understanding, the relevant code spans to address the issue would be the `__mul__` method itself and possibly the missing or improperly implemented `__rmul__` method.",
