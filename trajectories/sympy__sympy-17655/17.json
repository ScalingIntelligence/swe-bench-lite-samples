The user observes that the expression `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError`. This suggests an issue with the order of operations or the handling of the `Mul` object in the `__add__` method of the `Point` class. The search results provide the implementation of the `Point` class, including the `__new__`, `__add__`, and `__mul__` methods. Specifically, the `__add__` method attempts to normalize the dimensions of the points being added but fails if the `other` object is not recognized as a `Point`. This is likely the source of the error, as `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` results in an object that the `__add__` method does not know how to handle.",

The issue occurs when trying to multiply a number with a Point object in a different order than it works when multiplying a Point object with a number. The error message indicates that the Point class does not know how to handle the multiplication when the order is reversed. The context provided includes the relevant code spans from the 'Point' class in the 'sympy/geometry/point.py' file, particularly the '__add__' and '__mul__' methods of the 'Point' class. The search results include the 'Expr' class in the 'sympy/core/expr.py' file, which is relevant because it defines the behavior of expressions in SymPy and might contain methods for handling multiplication or arithmetic operations. The search results confirm that 'Expr' does include '__mul__' and '__rmul__' methods, which are relevant to the multiplication issue reported. It is plausible that the 'Point' class may need to implement '__rmul__' or handle multiplication in the reverse order. However, the provided context does not show an implementation for '__rmul__' in the 'Point' class, suggesting that this might be the missing piece to address the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans identified are the '__add__' and '__mul__' methods from 'sympy/geometry/point.py', and possibly the '__mul__' and '__rmul__' methods from 'sympy/core/expr.py' need to be considered as well to possibly implement a solution.",

The `Expr` class includes a `__mul__` method with a decorator `call_highest_priority('__rmul__')`, which indicates that `__rmul__` might be implemented higher up in the class hierarchy, potentially in a class that `Expr` might inherit from or that `GeometryEntity` indirectly utilizes through multiple inheritance or mixins.
