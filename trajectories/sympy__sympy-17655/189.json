The exception occurs specifically when attempting to multiply the point after sympifying the number, which differs from when the multiplication occurs before the addition. This suggests an issue with the order of operations or how the Point class handles these operations. The relevant code spans in the search results include the methods Point.__add__ and Point.__mul__. The Point.__add__ method handles the addition of points, including a TypeError exception handling block that raises a GeometryError if the addition operation is not understood. The Point.__mul__ method handles multiplication of a point by a factor. To resolve the issue, one must ensure that the Point class correctly handles the multiplication and addition operations in all contexts, particularly when the multiplication occurs after sympifying a number. These methods are thus identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "1. The reported issue involves an unexpected exception when multiplying a geometry.Point object with a number using different orders. Specifically, it works when the number is multiplied by the point first, but fails when the point is multiplied by the number first.\n\n2. The current file context provides a snippet of the `Point` class from `sympy/geometry/point.py`, which includes the `__add__`, `__mul__` and `__div__` methods. This context helps in understanding the existing implementation of these operations.\n\n3. Analyzing the new search results:\n - The `Point` class is segmented into several spans showing various methods and attributes. Notably, both `__add__` and `__mul__` methods are present, showing their implementations in detail.\n - Additional relevant methods include `__div__`, `__neg__`, `midpoint`, and `evalf`, which could provide extra context on how operations involving points are handled.\n - Class methods `are_coplanar`, `is_concyclic`, and properties like `orthogonal_direction`, `origin` also appear in the results, but they seem less relevant to the reported issue.\n\n4. Analyzing for relevance to the reported issue:\n - The `__add__` method throws a `GeometryError`, confirming the issue observed when trying to add a point that has been multiplied by a factor. The error message suggests that the system does not know how to handle the operation when it involves a point multiplied by a scalar.\n - The `__mul__` method correctly scales each coordinate of the point by the given factor, so the issue likely lies in the handling of `__rmul__` or, more specifically, in how `__add__` and `__mul__` are interacting in certain sequences of operations.\n - The existence of `__div__` suggest symmetry in the point arithmetic operations that might influence expected behavior regarding precedence and interaction of these operations.\n\n5. The search results do not directly suggest missing elements regarding the implementation of `__mul__` for `Point`, but do highlight potential issues in the order of operations within point arithmetic context.\n\n6. After reviewing the entire section in `sympy/geometry/point.py`, including all code spans, it is clear that the key operations (`__add__`, `__mul__`, and their interaction) are central to solving the reported issue. No additional references to other parts of the codebase seem necessary for solving the main issue reported.\n\nBased on this analysis, the search completes the identification of relevant sections within `sympy/geometry/point.py`.",
