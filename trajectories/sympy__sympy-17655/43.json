The issue suggests that the multiplication operation might not be symmetric as expected. By examining the provided code spans, it's clear that the Point class has defined both __add__ and __mul__ methods, which handle addition and multiplication respectively. The __mul__ method is responsible for multiplying a Point by a factor, and it seems to correctly handle the multiplication by iterating over the coordinates and scaling them by the factor. However, the exception occurs in the __add__ method when it tries to add a Mul object (result of the multiplication) to a Point object. This indicates that the __add__ method does not handle the case where 'other' is a Mul object, which is why the exception is raised. The task is to identify the relevant code spans that need to be reviewed or modified to handle this case properly.",

The __add__ method attempts to normalize dimensions when adding points and raises an error if it can't. The __mul__ method handles multiplication of the Point object with a factor. However, the actual issue arises when attempting to multiply a Point object on the right-hand side of a multiplication operation. The file context does not include the __rmul__ method, which could be essential for handling multiplication when the Point object is on the right.
