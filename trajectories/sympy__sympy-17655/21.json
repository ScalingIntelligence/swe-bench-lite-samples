            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves unexpected behavior when multiplying a `geometry.Point` object with a number. Specifically, the order of multiplication seems to affect the outcome, leading to a `TypeError` or `GeometryError`. To address this issue, I need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the multiplication and addition of `Point` objects. I first analyzed the `Point` class within `sympy/geometry/point.py` to understand how it handles addition (`__add__`) and multiplication (`__mul__`). The `Point.__mul__` method is responsible for multiplying a point by a factor, and it converts the factor to a `sympify` object before performing the multiplication. The `Point.__add__` method attempts to handle addition by normalizing dimensions and raising a `GeometryError` if it does not know how to add the objects. Next, I examined `sympy/core/numbers.py` to ensure that the numeric operations are correctly handling `sympify` objects when performing multiplications. I found `Float.__mul__` and `Rational.__mul__` which indicate that these numeric types are equipped with multiplication methods that involve sympifying the other operand. Finally, in `sympy/core/mul.py`, I explored the `Mul` class to understand how it handles the multiplication of expressions. The `Mul.flatten` method processes sequences of `Mul` operations and is intended to handle commutative and non-commutative multiplications. Based on the analysis, the identified code spans should provide a comprehensive view of how multiplication and addition are handled within the `Point` class and other related numeric operations.",
