The exception indicates that the `Point` object's `__add__` method does not handle the multiplication result (`2.0*Point2D(1, 1)`) properly. This suggests that the code for handling multiplication order and type compatibility might be incomplete or incorrect. From the search results, the relevant code spans are primarily in `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py`. The `Point.__mul__` method is used for multiplication, but there might be an issue with how `__rmul__` is handled or how `GeometryEntity` handles right multiplication. Additionally, the `Number.__mul__` and `Float.__mul__` methods might also be relevant to explore how number multiplication is handled in a left and right context.
