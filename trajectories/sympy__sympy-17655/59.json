The user observes that while 'point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)' executes without error, 'point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2' raises a TypeError. This issue suggests that there may be an asymmetry in how Point objects handle multiplication and addition operations. By examining the provided search results, it's clear that the Point class has '__add__' and '__mul__' methods implemented, which are responsible for addition and multiplication, respectively. The '__add__' method checks if the other object is a Point, and if not, it raises a GeometryError. The '__mul__' method multiplies each coordinate of the Point by a factor. Since the error occurs when attempting 'sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2', it indicates a possible lack of support for reverse multiplication (i.e., the __rmul__ method might not be appropriately defined or implemented for Point objects). Given these insights, the relevant code spans to focus on include the '__add__' and '__mul__' methods, which need to be reviewed or possibly extended to ensure that the expected behavior is achieved.",

Specifically, the exception occurs when attempting to multiply a point by a sympified number in reverse order, whereas the operation works fine when the point is multiplied by the number first. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods in the `Point` class and potentially the `GeometryEntity` class. The search results include relevant code spans in the `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/geometry/entity.py` files, particularly the `Point.__mul__` and `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` methods. The `Point.__mul__` method is responsible for multiplying a point by a factor, and the `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` method is expected to handle the reverse multiplication. These methods seem crucial for addressing the issue, but the `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` method does not currently include a specific implementation to handle the reverse multiplication involving a `Point` object. Additionally, the `Point._normalize_dimension` method could be relevant if it is involved in type checking during the addition operation.",
