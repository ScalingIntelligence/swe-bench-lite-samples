The exception occurs specifically when trying to multiply a sympy.sympify(2.0) with a Point2D object, which raises a TypeError because the system doesn't know how to handle the multiplication in this order. To resolve this, we need to understand how the __mul__ and __rmul__ methods are defined for Point and Expr classes respectively. From the search results, we see implementations of __mul__ for both Point and Expr classes. The Point class's __mul__ method multiplies each coordinate by the factor, which is expected behavior. The Expr class's __mul__ and __rmul__ methods create a Mul object, which is standard for expression multiplication in SymPy. However, the Point class does not implement an __rmul__ method, which is likely the cause of the exception when the multiplication order is reversed. Identifying the relevant code spans in the Point and Expr classes will help in understanding and potentially fixing this issue.",
