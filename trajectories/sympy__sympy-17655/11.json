The expected behavior is that this operation should work the same as `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`. The issue seems to be related to how the multiplication and addition operations are handled in the Point class and in the sympy core classes. To address the issue, I need to find the relevant code spans that handle the multiplication and addition operations both in the Point class and in the sympy core classes that could affect this behavior. From the search results, I found several relevant code spans in 'sympy/geometry/point.py' and several other relevant spans in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' and 'sympy/core/expr.py'. These spans include the '__mul__' methods in Point and various Number classes, and the '__mul__' and '__rmul__' methods in the Expr class. These methods define how multiplication operations are handled for Points, Numbers, and Expressions, and are directly relevant to the issue. By examining these spans, I can determine if there is a specific case where the multiplication operation with Points is not handled correctly, leading to the reported exception.",
