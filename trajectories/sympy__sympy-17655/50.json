The problem arises from the order of operations in the multiplication. Specifically, when attempting to multiply a number by a Point object, an exception is raised. The relevant files and functions for investigation include the Point class in sympy/geometry/point.py, particularly the __mul__ and __rmul__ methods, and the GeometryEntity class in sympy/geometry/entity.py, focusing on the __rmul__ method. Additionally, examining the sympy/core/numbers.py file for the behavior of number classes like Float and Rational during multiplication might be helpful.",

The exception occurs specifically when trying to multiply a number and a Point object in that order. The key elements to look for in the codebase are the methods related to multiplication (__mul__), addition (__add__), and any methods that handle arithmetic operations involving Point objects. From the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'sympy/geometry/point.py' file, particularly the methods 'Point.__mul__' and 'Point.__add__'. These methods are crucial for understanding how multiplication and addition are handled for Point objects. Additional context from the 'Point2D' class might also be relevant, specifically the 'Point2D.scale' method which also involves scaling by a factor (similar to multiplication). This analysis suggests that the issue may stem from how the Point class handles arithmetic operations and the order in which the operands are received. Therefore, code spans related to these methods are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
