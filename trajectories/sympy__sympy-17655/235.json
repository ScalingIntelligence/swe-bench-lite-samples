The user provided code snippets show that `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError`. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `__add__` method of `sympy.geometry.Point` when trying to add `2.0 * Point2D(1, 1)` to a `Point` object. The expected behavior is that both expressions should yield the same result. The search results include the `__mul__` methods for `Number`, `Float`, and `Rational` in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' and the `flatten` method of `Mul` in 'sympy/core/mul.py'. These methods are relevant because they define the multiplication behavior for numbers and expressions, which is crucial for understanding why the multiplication operation with `Point` objects is failing in the second case. The `flatten` method in `Mul` is also relevant as it handles the flattening of multiplication operations, which could impact how the multiplication is processed and potentially where the error occurs.",

However, this method does not explicitly handle situations where a number is multiplied by a Point, suggesting this might be the root cause of the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the identified spans from sympy/core/numbers.py and sympy/core/mul.py show the implementation of multiplication for Number, Float, and Rational classes, which suggests the system's handling of standard numeric types but does not directly address the interaction with custom types like Point.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans to address the reported issue should include the __mul__ method of the Point class to review and potentially adjust its behavior to include handling for cases where a number precedes the Point in multiplication.",

From the file context, we have identified the relevant code spans. Specifically, we have 'Point.__mul__' which defines the multiplication behavior for the Point class, 'Number.__mul__', 'Float.__mul__', and 'Rational.__mul__' which define the multiplication behavior for different types of numbers in SymPy. Additionally, 'Mul.flatten' appears relevant as it deals with how multiplication operations are flattened and combined. We confirm that the search results include code spans that define the multiplication behavior for both Point and Number instances, specifically within 'sympy/geometry/point.py'.
