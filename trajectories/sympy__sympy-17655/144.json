The problem arises due to the order of operations: 'point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)' works, but 'point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2' raises a TypeError. The error suggests that the 'Point' class in sympy.geometry does not handle the reverse multiplication operation ('__rmul__') correctly. To address this, we need to focus on the 'Point' class's methods in 'sympy/geometry/point.py' and the '__rmul__' method in 'sympy/core/numbers.py', as these are likely where the issue lies.",

From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are primarily located in the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file, specifically the methods `Point.__mul__`, `Point.__add__`, and `Point.__sub__`. These methods are crucial for understanding how the Point class interacts with other objects during arithmetic operations. Additionally, the `Point._normalize_dimension` method is relevant for understanding how the class handles different dimensionalities. The `sympy/core/numbers.py` file also contains relevant code spans for `Float.__mul__` and `Rational.__mul__`, which are important for understanding how numbers interact with Point objects during multiplication.

However, the '__rmul__' method, which would handle the reverse multiplication scenario (e.g., 'sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2'), is not found in the provided context.
