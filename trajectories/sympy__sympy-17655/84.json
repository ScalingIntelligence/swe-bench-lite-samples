The error is caused when attempting to multiply a `sympy.sympify(2.0)` (which is likely a Float or Rational number) with a `Point2D` object and then add it to another `Point2D` object. The error message suggests that the `Point.__add__` method does not know how to handle the multiplication result when it is on the right-hand side of the addition. This discrepancy in behavior could be due to how the `__rmul__` (reflected multiplication) method is defined or not defined in the `Point` class or its superclasses.

For instance, the 'Point.__rmul__' method is missing in the search results, which could be the reason for the unexpected behavior when the multiplication order is reversed. Additionally, the 'Point.__add__' method is raised in the exception traceback, indicating that the method doesn't know how to handle the addition involving a multiplication result in a specific order. To address the issue, it's crucial to identify and verify the implementation of 'Point.__rmul__' if it exists, or implement it if it's missing.
