The error occurs when trying to multiply a `geometry.Point` object by a `sympy.sympify(2.0)` expression in reverse order. The error indicates that the `Point` class does not know how to handle this operation. To resolve this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the `Point` class and its interaction with the multiplication operation in SymPy. We should focus on the `__rmul__` method in the `Point` class and any related methods in other classes that could handle reverse multiplication operations.",

The exception occurs specifically when trying to multiply a `sympy.sympify(2.0)` by a `geometry.Point` object, which is not handled correctly. The current implementation of the `geometry.Point` class has methods for addition (`__add__`), multiplication (`__mul__`), and subtraction (`__sub__`), among others. The error stems from the `__add__` method not being able to handle the case where a `Mul` object (result of `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`) is added to a `Point` object. The relevant code spans to address this issue would be within the `__mul__`, `__add__`, and `_normalize_dimension` methods of the `Point` class. Specifically, the `__mul__` method should ensure that the multiplication operation is commutative and handled correctly when multiplied by a `sympy.sympify` object, and the `__add__` method should be able to handle summation with `Mul` objects. Additionally, the `_normalize_dimension` method should be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles dimension normalization in a context where points are multiplied by sympified objects.",
