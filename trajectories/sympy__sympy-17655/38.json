The error occurs specifically when trying to multiply the number and the point in that order, which suggests that the method defined for right multiplication (__rmul__) might not be correctly implemented or missing. Given the provided context and the error traceback, it is clear that the error is occurring in the __add__ method of the Point class in sympy/geometry/point.py. Further, the GeometryError suggests that the system does not know how to handle the addition of a Point object with a multiplication expression involving a Point object. Therefore, the focus should be on the __rmul__ method in the Point class and the interaction between the Point class and other classes that involve multiplication, such as Number and Float classes in sympy/core/numbers.py. Also, understanding how Mul class flattens sequences in sympy/core/mul.py and the overall Expr class handling in sympy/core/expr.py could be relevant to resolving the issue.",

The key elements to look for in the codebase are the definitions and implementations of the multiplication operation (__mul__) for both Point and Number classes, especially to understand how the operation might be handled differently based on the operand order. The given search results include relevant code spans from sympy/core/numbers.py, sympy/core/mul.py, and sympy/core/expr.py, which contain the definitions and implementations of the Number, Float, and Expr classes along with their respective multiplication methods. The spans 'Number.__mul__', 'Float.__mul__', and 'Expr.__mul__' are directly related because they define how these types of objects should behave when multiplied with another object. Additionally, the 'Mul' class in sympy/core/mul.py contains important logic for how multiplication operations are flattened and evaluated, which could potentially impact how Point objects interact with numbers during multiplication. These identified spans thus address the core functionality concerning the reported issue.",

Further, the GeometryError suggests that the system does not know how to handle the addition of a Point object with a multiplication expression involving a Point object. Therefore, the focus should be on the __rmul__ method in the Point class and the interaction between the Point class and other classes that involve multiplication, such as Number and Float classes in sympy/core/numbers.py.
