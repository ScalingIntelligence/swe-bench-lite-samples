            "scratch_pad": "The issue revolves around the multiplication operation involving geometry.Point objects in the SymPy library. The specific problem is that multiplying a Point object by a number before addition (`point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`) raises an exception, whereas multiplying after addition (`point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`) works fine. This discrepancy suggests an issue with how the __mul__ method of the Point class and the addition operation between Point objects are handled. Therefore, two primary areas need to be investigated: the Point class\u2019s __mul__ method and the __add__ method to understand how the Point object behaves during multiplication and addition. Additionally, examining the __rmul__ method and the interaction between scalar multiplication and Point objects is crucial to identify why the order of multiplication matters.",

The code provided demonstrates that `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError` and a `GeometryError`. The key to resolving this issue lies in understanding how the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods are defined and used in the `Point` class and `GeometryEntity` class. From the search results, we can see the definitions of `Point.__add__`, `Point.__mul__`, and `GeometryEntity.__rmul__`. The `__add__` method in `Point` is where the exception is being raised, but the crucial method to look at for fixing the multiplication behavior is `__rmul__` in `GeometryEntity`, as it handles the reverse multiplication. The relevant code spans are those involving `Point.__add__`, `Point.__mul__`, and `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` as they are directly related to the reported issue.",

These are directly related to the operations of addition and multiplication involving Point objects, which are central to the reported issue. The issue involves the order in which multiplication and addition are performed (specifically, whether a scalar multiplication is applied before or after an addition operation involving Point objects). This behavior, particularly the TypeError during the addition of a Point object and the result of scalar multiplication, suggests that the order of operations impacts the internal handling of Point objects. The __mul__ method in the Point class and the __add__ method should be examined more closely to determine why the sequence of operations matters.
