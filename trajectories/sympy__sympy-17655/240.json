The stack trace indicates that the error is occurring in the `__add__` method of the `Point` class in `sympy/geometry/point.py`, suggesting that the issue might be related to how the addition operation is handled between a Point and a number. Analyzing the new search results, it's clear that the `Point` class does have a `__mul__` method that supports multiplication with a factor but does not consider how the multiplication would be handled in reverse (i.e., when the `Point` object is on the right side of the multiplication). The error message indicates that the system does not know how to add a `Mul` object to a `Point` object. Thus, the relevant code spans are those related to the `Point` class's `__mul__` and `__add__` methods, as well as any additional handling for `__rmul__` in the `GeometryEntity` class to ensure that reverse multiplication is also handled correctly for a `Point` object.\n\nIdentified relevant code spans include:\n1. `Point.__mul__`: This method correctly handles multiplication with a factor and returns a new `Point` object with transformed coordinates.\n2. `GeometryEntity.__rmul__`: This method should potentially handle reverse multiplication, ensuring that multiplying a number by a `Point` returns the expected result.\n3. The error handling in `Point.__add__` also needs to be checked to ensure that it correctly deals with adding a `Mul` object to a `Point` object without raising an exception.\n\nBy focusing on these code spans, it should be possible to address the reported issue by either improving the reverse multiplication handling or enhancing the error checking for addition operations involving `Point` objects.",

From the provided file context, it's clear that the `Point` class in `sympy/geometry/point.py` has these methods implemented, but the issue might be related to the handling of multiplication with `sympy.sympify(2.0)` and the subsequent addition. The search results confirm the presence of the `__rmul__` method in `GeometryEntity`, suggesting that the issue might be related to how multiplication is handled when the Point object is on the right side of the multiplication operation. Additionally, the `__mul__` methods in `Float` and `Rational` classes in `sympy/core/numbers.py` are relevant as they detail how these numeric types interact with Multiplication. The `flatten` method in `Mul` class in `sympy/core/mul.py` is also significant as it deals with the flattening of multiplication operations, potentially influencing how the multiplication between a `Point` and a number is evaluated. Given the detailed analysis, it appears that the relevant code spans are well-documented in the provided context and search results, addressing the core functionalities involved in the reported issue.",

The Point class directly implements the __mul__ method to handle multiplication with a factor, which simplifies coordinates accordingly. Notably, the GeometryEntity class, a superclass of Point, handles reverse multiplication (__rmul__) by attempting to multiply from the other side, suggesting that if reverse multiplication is not explicitly defined for Point, it might fall back to this behavior. Additionally, the Float and Rational classes in sympy.core.numbers.py implement the __mul__ method, indicating how these classes handle multiplication, which is essential for understanding how they interact with Point objects.

The specific problem is that multiplying `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError` stating that it doesn't know how to add `2.0*Point2D(1, 1)` and a `Point` object. This indicates a problem with the commutative nature of the multiplication between a number and a `Point` object. Existing relevant code spans include `Point.__mul__`, `Point.__add__`, and `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` in `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/geometry/entity.py`, as well as `Float.__mul__` and `Rational.__mul__` in `sympy/core/numbers.py`. The search results have also provided evidence on how numbers handle multiplication with `Mul.flatten` in `sympy/core/mul.py`. Based on the analysis, the identified spans correctly handle the multiplication of `Point` objects with numbers, but the commutative nature seems to be the issue. The `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` method explicitly states that it returns the result of `a.__mul__(self)`, which suggests that the left multiplication is delegated to the right operand's `__mul__` method, which is likely causing the issue when the number is on the left. Following the ideas from the search results, it seems like aligning the existing code with these findings should help resolve the issue.",

These classes implement various arithmetic operations, including multiplication (__mul__) and reverse multiplication (__rmul__), which are crucial for understanding the multiplication behavior between Point objects and other numerical entities. The Point class directly implements the __mul__ method to handle multiplication with a factor, which simplifies coordinates accordingly. Notably, the GeometryEntity class, a superclass of Point, handles reverse multiplication (__rmul__) by attempting to multiply from the other side, suggesting that if reverse multiplication is not explicitly defined for Point, it might fall back to this behavior. Additionally, the Float and Rational classes in sympy.core.numbers.py implement the __mul__ method, indicating how these classes handle multiplication, which is essential for understanding how they interact with Point objects. Despite the detailed context, the __rmul__ method is not directly implemented in the Point class, and the critical interaction between Point, Float, and Rational classes during reverse multiplication remains uncertain, necessitating further detailed review.",
