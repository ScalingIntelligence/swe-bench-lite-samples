The issue occurs because the geometry.Point object does not know how to handle an operation where it is not on the left side (GeometryError). The provided search results include relevant code spans from sympy/geometry/point.py and sympy/core/numbers.py. In sympy/geometry/point.py, the __add__ method is identified as relevant because it handles the addition operation between Point objects and raises a GeometryError if it doesn't know how to add the given object to a Point. The __mul__ method in the same file is also relevant because it handles multiplication of a Point by a factor, which is an essential part of the reported issue. Additionally, the sympy/core/numbers.py file contains definitions and behaviors for Number, Float, Rational, Integer, Infinity, NegativeInfinity, and NaN classes, which are relevant as they define the multiplication behavior for these types. The GeometryEntity class in sympy/geometry/entity.py also has relevance because it defines the rmul behavior for entities, indicating how they should behave when multiplied from the right side by a number. Together, these code spans provide a comprehensive overview of the multiplication and addition operations involving Point objects and numbers in the sympy library.",
