The user observed that multiplying a point by a number and then adding it to another point works, but the reverse order raises an exception. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `__add__` method of the `Point` class in the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file. Specifically, the error arises when the `Point` class tries to add a `Mul` object (which is the result of multiplying a number by a point) to a `Point` object. This suggests a need to handle the specific case where the `other` argument in the `__add__` method could be a `Mul` object that contains a `Point` object. By examining the provided code spans, it's clear that the current implementation of `__add__` does not account for this scenario, and it raises a `GeometryError` when the `TypeError` is caught. Similarly, the `__mul__` method directly multiplies each coordinate of the point by the factor, but it doesn't influence the addition operation's handling of this result. To address the issue, the `__add__` method should include specific handling for `Mul` objects containing `Point` objects, potentially by extracting the `Point` from the `Mul` and applying the appropriate arithmetic operations. However, at this stage, the existing code spans are directly related to the issue as they define the problematic operations.",
