The issue specifically points to differences in behavior when performing multiplication before or after addition with Point objects. The search results include code spans from sympy/geometry/point.py, sympy/core/numbers.py, and sympy/geometry/entity.py. The relevant spans are those that define the __add__ and __mul__ methods for the Point class and also check the corresponding methods in the Number class to ensure compatibility and expected behavior when numbers and points interact through multiplication and addition. The identified spans in point.py include those for Point.__add__ and Point.__mul__, which directly relate to the operations raising the exception. Additionally, the Number class in numbers.py is relevant as it is the base class for all number types in sympy, and understanding how it interacts with the Point class through __mul__ and __add__ can provide insights into the exception. Also, the geometries/entity.py is included for additional context on how addition and multiplication are handled at a higher level in the geometry entities hierarchy.

The user observes that the operation `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympify.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError` and a `GeometryError`. The expected behavior is that both expressions should yield the same result.\n\nFrom the provided file context, we have the definitions of `Point`, `Point.__add__`, and `Point.__mul__` in `sympy/geometry/point.py`. Additionally, we have the `__add__` and `__mul__` methods for `Number` and its subclasses (`Float` and `Rational`) from `sympy/core/numbers.py`. The `__rmul__` method from `GeometryEntity` in `sympy/geometry/entity.py` seems relevant as it defines the behavior for right multiplication.\n\nIn the new search results, there's the `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` method which seems relevant as it involves the right multiplication behavior for `GeometryEntity`, which `Point` inherits from. This method attempts to delegate the operation to the left-hand side object's `__mul__` method, which is consistent with Python's operator overloading behavior.\n\nTo address the issue, we should ensure that `Point.__mul__` supports multiplication with numbers on both sides, likely requiring adjustments to `Point.__rmul__` if not already defined, to handle the situation gracefully, especially when the number is on the left-hand side. The existing code may not properly handle this case, which could lead to the observed error.",
