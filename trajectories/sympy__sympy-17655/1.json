The user observes that `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError`. This indicates a problem with operand order handling in the multiplication implementation of the `Point` class. In the analyzed code, we find the `Point.__mul__` method, which is responsible for multiplying a `Point` object with a factor. The current implementation simplifies the coordinates without checking the type of the factor, which might lead to the observed error when the order of multiplication is reversed. Additionally, the `Number.__mul__` and `Float.__mul__` methods in `sympy/core/numbers.py` handle multiplication specifically for `Number` and `Float` types, but there doesn't appear to be an explicit handling for multiplying a `Point` object directly in these methods. The issue seems to stem from the interaction between these different classes, particularly how `Point.__add__` expects `other` to be a `Point` object directly, and does not handle expressions like `2.0 * Point2D(1, 1)` gracefully. Since the issue is about the order of operations and object type handling specifically in the context of multiplication and addition of `Point` objects, the identified spans in `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py` are relevant to addressing the issue.",
