Specifically, the problem occurs when the multiplication operation is performed in a specific order: `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`. The expected behavior is for this operation to work similarly to `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`. To resolve this, it's necessary to investigate how the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods are implemented in the Point class and related classes, particularly focusing on how the sympification of numbers interacts with geometry entities.",

The relevant code spans include the `__mul__` method in the `Point` class, which defines how a `Point` object is multiplied by a factor, and the `__add__` method and other related methods in the `GeometryEntity` and `Point` classes that handle addition operations between `Point` objects and other types. The `GeometryEntity` class also includes `__radd__` and `__rmul__` methods, which handle operations where the `GeometryEntity` is on the right side of the operation. Additionally, the `Number` class and its subclasses like `Float` and `Rational` also include `__mul__` methods, which define multiplication operations for these types. These methods provide the context for understanding how multiplication between different types is handled in Sympy, and could be involved in the unexpected exception when the multiplication operation involves a `Point` object. Identifying these methods helps in understanding where the issue might arise when the order of multiplication with a `Point` object is reversed, as reported in the issue. This analysis and identification of relevant code spans should help in diagnosing and addressing the unexpected exception.",

The exception occurs specifically when the number precedes the Point object in the multiplication, indicating a possible issue with the __rmul__ method or its absence in the Point class. The current context includes relevant code spans from the Point class in sympy/geometry/point.py, which defines the __add__, __div__, __mul__, __neg__, are_coplanar, intersection, midpoint, and translations methods. Additionally, the GeometryEntity class in sympy/geometry/entity.py includes the __radd__ and __rmul__ methods, though it's not clear if these are directly used by the Point class. The search results include additional implementations of __mul__ in the Number, Float, and Rational classes in sympy/core/numbers.py, which might be indirectly related to the issue if the number being multiplied is an instance of one of these classes. No direct implementation of __rmul__ for Point is found, which might be the missing piece to resolve the issue.",

However, the specific issue of multiplication order leading to exceptions when sympified numbers are on the left side (as in 'sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2') might require deeper inspection of interaction handling between different types of entities in SymPy. The current analysis shows there isn't an immediate method implemented to handle this reverse multiplication scenario directly within the provided files, but the structure to implement such functionality is present (i.e., the failure indicated in the error message originates from a lack of specific handling rather than a fundamental design issue). Further research should focus on whether SymPy has alternative mechanisms or logic outside these files to manage such operations.",
