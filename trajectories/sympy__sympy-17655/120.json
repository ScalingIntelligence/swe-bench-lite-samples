The exception is raised by the '__add__' method in the Point class due to the inability to handle the result of multiplication from one order but not the other. To resolve this, we need to investigate how the multiplication and addition methods are defined and how they interact. Specifically, the Point class's '__add__' and '__mul__' methods need to be examined, along with the handling of these operations in related classes like GeometryEntity and Number. Given the complexity, it might also be necessary to check how multiplications are flattened and evaluated in the context of Expr, Mul, and related classes.",

The error occurs specifically when the multiplication order is reversed, i.e., `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises an exception, whereas `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` does not. This discrepancy suggests a potential issue with how multiplication is handled in the `Point` class or with the `Expr` class, which `Point` inherits from. Upon examining the search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are found in `sympy/geometry/point.py` (specifically in the `Point.__mul__` and `Point.__add__` methods), `sympy/core/expr.py` (to understand how multiplication is processed in the `Expr` class), `sympy/core/mul.py` (to understand how the `Mul` class processes multiplication), and `sympy/core/numbers.py` (to understand how numbers are processed during arithmetic operations). These sections of code are crucial for diagnosing the issue since they deal directly with arithmetic operations on `Point` objects and how numbers and expressions interact with them.",
