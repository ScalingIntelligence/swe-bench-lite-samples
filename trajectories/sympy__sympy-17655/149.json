The error occurs specifically when the multiplication is performed before the addition operation, indicating a potential bug or limitation in handling the operator precedence or type coercion. The stack trace and exception messages suggest that the `__mul__` and `__add__` methods in the `Point` class and possibly other related classes need to be reviewed and adjusted to handle such operations correctly. The goal is to ensure that both `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` and `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` yield the same result without raising exceptions.",

This suggests an underlying issue with the `__mul__` or `__add__` method implementations in the `Point` class or related classes. From the provided search results, the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file contains the relevant `Point` class and its `__add__` and `__mul__` methods. Additionally, the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file contains implementations for `Number`, `Float`, and `Rational` classes, which might interact with the `Point` class during multiplication operations. The `sympy/matrices/common.py` file contains a `MatrixArithmetic` class with a `__mul__` method, but this appears unrelated to the issue at hand as it pertains to matrix arithmetic rather than point geometry. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those dealing with the `Point` class's arithmetic operations and the `Number` class hierarchy in the `sympy/geometry/point.py` and `sympy/core/numbers.py` files, respectively.",
