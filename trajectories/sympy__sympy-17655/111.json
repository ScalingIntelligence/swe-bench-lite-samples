Specifically, the error occurs in the `__add__` method of the `Point` class when attempting to add a `Point` object with a `Mul` object (resulting from the multiplication). The error message indicates that the `__add__` method is not equipped to handle the specific type of object being added. To resolve this, it's crucial to understand how the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods are implemented across different classes and ensure the proper handling of the resulting objects during addition. Therefore, the search should focus on the `__add__`, `__mul__`, and `__rmul__` methods in the context of geometry and core SymPy classes.",
