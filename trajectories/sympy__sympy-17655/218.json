The exception occurs when trying to perform `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`, but works fine with `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)`. This suggests a problem with the handling of the multiplication operation in the `Point` class or in the reverse multiplication operation when the left operand is not a `Point` object.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans are:\n1. The `__mul__` method in the `Point` class, which handles the multiplication of a `Point` object by a factor.\n2. The `__rmul__` method in the `GeometryEntity` class, which handles the reverse multiplication when the left operand is not a `Point` object. This is the likely cause of the issue since it directly relates to the situation described in the reported issue.\n3. The `__mul__` methods in the `Number`, `Float`, `Rational`, and `Integer` classes are less relevant but provide context on how multiplication is typically handled in these numeric classes within SymPy.\n\nThe focus, however, should be on the `Point` class's multiplication handling and the reverse multiplication in `GeometryEntity`, as they directly relate to the specific issue of multiplying a `Point` object and a number in different orders.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves an unexpected exception when multiplying a `geometry.Point` object with a number in a non-commutative manner. Specifically, the expression `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `GeometryError` while `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` does not. This suggests an inconsistency in how multiplication and addition are handled between `Point` objects and numbers, particularly with respect to the commutative property of multiplication. From the context provided, the `Point` class defines the `__mul__` method to handle multiplication by a factor, which indicates that `Point * number` is supported. However, the error message `Don't know how to add 2.0*Point2D(1, 1) and a Point object` implies that the system does not know how to handle `number * Point`. This could be due to the absence of an appropriate `__rmul__` method in the `Point` class or a related class, necessitating its implementation or adjustment. Reviewing the new search results, particularly the `Expr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py`, which defines `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods that default to creating a `Mul` object, confirms this hypothesis. Additionally, the `GeometryEntity` class in `sympy/geometry/entity.py` also includes an `__rmul__` method that simply forwards the operation if the `__mul__` method of the other object does not handle it. This further supports the need to ensure that `Point.__rmul__` is correctly defined to handle the case where a number is multiplied on the left. Implementation of this method in `Point` could solve the issue, ensuring that both `Point * number` and `number * Point` behave consistently. Thus, I will identify the relevant parts of the code in `sympy/core/expr.py` and `sympy/geometry/entity.py` to address this issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "To understand and resolve the issue reported regarding the multiplication of a geometry.Point with a number resulting in an unexpected exception, it is crucial to analyze the methods responsible for the multiplication operation (__mul__) in the Point class in 'sympy/geometry/point.py'. Additionally, understanding how the '__rmul__' method in the GeometryEntity class interacts with specific types of numbers (Float, Rational, Integer) in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' is essential as it might provide clues about why the operation fails in one order (i.e., when the Point is on the right side of the multiplication) but not in the other. The analysis of the '__mul__' and '__rmul__' methods in various classes such as Expr, Number, Float, Rational, and Integer in 'sympy/core/expr.py' and 'sympy/core/numbers.py' is also necessary to grasp the interaction rules between different types and may reveal potential issues with operator overloading when dealing with composite operations. The provided search results include significant sections of the code that define and handle these operations which are directly related to the reported issue. In particular, the '__rmul__' method in GeometryEntity ensuring commutative property for right multiplication might hint at potential clashes with specific types like Float that might not handle right multiplication the same way as left multiplication. The '__mul__' method in Mul class in 'sympy/core/mul.py' shows how multiplications combine and factor out pertinent terms, which is central to how numerical operations are processed and coordinated in the system. Therefore, these code snippets are essential for identifying and potentially correcting the issue with the multiplying geometry.Point and number.",

The `GeometryEntity.__rmul__` method is designed to handle the reverse multiplication case by delegating the operation to the `__mul__` method of the left-hand side operand. The `Point` class does have an `__mul__` method that handles multiplication with a scalar correctly, but it does not handle the case when a `Mul` object is on the left-hand side of the operation and a `Point` object is on the right-hand side. This discrepancy is the root cause of the issue observed when attempting to perform the operation `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`. It suggests that the `__rmul__` method in `GeometryEntity` might not be correctly managing the interaction between `Mul` objects and `Point` objects, particularly in the context of mixed operations involving both addition and multiplication. The investigation should continue by examining how other geometric entities handle similar situations, as they might provide insights or patterns to follow for correctly implementing the required functionality.",
