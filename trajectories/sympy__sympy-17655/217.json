The `__add__` method in the `Point` class where it handles addition but does not handle the case of multiplying a number with a Point object before addition.\n\n2. The `__rmul__` method in `GeometryEntity`, which indicates that right multiplication (such as `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2`) should revert to the left multiplication handled by the number's `__mul__` method, which in this case doesn't correctly handle the Point object.\n\nThese code spans are relevant because they directly deal with the operations being performed (addition and multiplication) and how they interact with the Point object.\n\nShould further inspection be needed, also consider looking into how the left multiplication is actually handled within the `Number` class in the SymPy library to ensure that it correctly interacts with `Point` objects.",
