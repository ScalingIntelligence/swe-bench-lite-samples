The user observed that the operation `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but the operation `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `TypeError`. The current file context provided shows the code related to the `__add__` method in the `Point` class, where a `GeometryError` is raised when adding an unexpected type. In the search results, a new method `__mul__` is found in the `Point` class, which defines how a `Point` object can be multiplied by a factor. This method might be relevant to the reported issue because it involves the multiplication of a `Point` object and a number, which is a key part of the expression that causes the issue. Hence, it is crucial to identify and analyze this `__mul__` method to understand if it contributes to the problem.",
