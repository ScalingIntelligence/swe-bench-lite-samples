This issue revolves around the __add__ method in the Point class, which is expected to handle the addition of a Point and a number, but fails when the number is multiplied by the Point on the right-hand side. This suggests a problem with the way the Point class handles the addition of different types and with the _normalize_dimension method. The search results include several key methods involving Point operations (__add__, __mul__, and _normalize_dimension). The __add__ method is particularly relevant, as it directly deals with the addition of points and includes a type check that raises a GeometryError if the types are not compatible. The __mul__ method is also relevant as it deals with multiplication of points by a factor. Considering the issue at hand, the key methods that need inspection are __add__ and __mul__ to ensure that they can handle the multiplication of a Point by a number regardless of the order of the operands.",

The current context shows that the __add__ method in the Point class tries to handle the addition of two Point objects but fails when the 'other' object is not a Point. The search results provide additional relevant code spans, including the __mul__ method which defines how a Point object should be multiplied by a factor. The __rmul__ method in the GeometryEntity class is also relevant as it deals with the reverse multiplication scenario, which could also be related to the issue. Both Point and Point2D classes are relevant given the issue involves geometry points. The search results also include other methods like __div__, __neg__, are_coplanar, evalf, intersection, is_concyclic, midpoint, origin, orthogonal_direction, rotate, and translate, which, although not directly linked to the multiplication issue, provide a comprehensive view of the Point class operations. \nThe relevant code spans to address the reported issue include:\n- Point.__mul__: This method defines how a Point object should be multiplied by a factor, which directly relates to the error.\n- GeometryEntity.__rmul__: This handles the reverse multiplication, which could also be a relevant context to the issue.\n- Point.__add__: The original context already highlights this method and its role in the error, particularly the part where it tries to add two Point objects but raises an exception if the 'other' object is not a Point.\nThese code spans are sufficient to start debugging and resolving the issue related to unexpected exceptions when multiplying geometry.Point and number.
