The relevant code spans are identified from the `sympy/geometry/point.py` file, where the methods `__mul__`, `__add__`, and `_normalize_dimension` are found to be directly related to the reported issue. The `__mul__` method defines the multiplication of a Point object with a factor, the `__add__` method handles the addition of two Point objects, and `_normalize_dimension` ensures that points are of the same dimension. These methods are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue with multiplication order. In the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, the `__mul__` methods for Number, Float, and Rational classes are relevant as they define the multiplication behavior for these types. In `sympy/core/expr.py`, the `__mul__` methods for the Expr class are also relevant as they define the multiplication behavior for expressions, which could be involved when using sympify on numbers. These code spans are identified as relevant because they directly involve the operations and transformations related to the issue at hand.",
