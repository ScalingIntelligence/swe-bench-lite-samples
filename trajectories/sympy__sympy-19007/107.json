The output `(A)[i, 0]` is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes the element comes from matrix `A`. The correct behavior should be to return the element without simplification, as it could come from either `A` or `B`. The issue lies in the `__getitem__` method of the `MatrixExpr` class and potentially in the `_entry` method of the `BlockMatrix` class. From the search results, the `__getitem__` method of `MatrixExpr` and the `_entry` method of `BlockMatrix` are crucial for addressing this issue, as they handle the element retrieval. The provided search results include these methods but also show similar implementations in the new search results, which can be used to refine the approach to fix the issue.",
