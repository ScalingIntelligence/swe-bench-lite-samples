The provided code snippet demonstrates that when accessing an element from a BlockMatrix, the result is simplified incorrectly, and it should not be simplified as the element could come from either matrix A or B. To address this issue, it is essential to identify the relevant code spans that handle indexing into MatrixExpr and BlockMatrix classes. The search results include several relevant spans:\n\n1. In 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py', the span with id 'MatrixExpr.__getitem__' is particularly relevant as it defines the behavior of the __getitem__ method for MatrixExpr, which is likely the method being used to access elements in the BlockMatrix. This method handles the indexing logic for Matrix expressions, including slices and single index accesses, and it directly affects how elements are fetched.\n\n2. In 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', the span with id 'PrettyPrinter._print_BlockMatrix' is relevant because it deals with the pretty printing of BlockMatrix objects. Although the immediate concern is not about printing but about the correctness of the matrix indexing, understanding how the BlockMatrix is handled for printing purposes can provide context on the structure of BlockMatrix objects.\n\nGiven these observations, both the 'MatrixExpr.__getitem__' and 'PrettyPrinter._print_BlockMatrix' spans are relevant to addressing the issue reported.
