Here are the steps taken to find the relevant code spans:\n\n1. **Identify the key elements from the issue description:**\n   - `BlockMatrix` class\n   - `__getitem__` method, as it handles indexing.\n\n2. **Analyze the search results for matches to these key elements:**\n   - The `BlockMatrix` class is found in `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py`.\n   - The `__getitem__` method for `BlockMatrix` or any related class is not directly found in the provided search results, which indicates that the `BlockMatrix` class might inherit this method from a base class.\n\n3. **Look for base classes that might implement the `__getitem__` method:**\n   - Several classes in the provided search results have a `__getitem__` method, such as `_MinimalMatrix`, `DenseMatrix`, `MatrixExpr`, and `SparseMatrix`. These could be potential base classes for `BlockMatrix`.\n\n4. **Evaluate which `__getitem__` methods could be relevant:**\n   - `_MinimalMatrix.__getitem__` normalizes slices and coordinates before accessing elements.\n   - `DenseMatrix.__getitem__` handles both single indexing and tuple indexing, potentially accessing elements of dense matrices.\n   - `MatrixExpr.__getitem__` handles indexing for matrix expressions, which might include BlockMatrix.\n   - `SparseMatrix.__getitem__` handles indexing for sparse matrices.\n\nGiven that the issue concerns `BlockMatrix`, `MatrixExpr.__getitem__` might be the most relevant as it specializes in handling matrix expressions, which `BlockMatrix` qualifies as.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will select the `__getitem__` method from `MatrixExpr` as the most likely relevant span for the reported issue.",

This method is central to resolving the issue since it directly addresses element fetching.\n- `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`: The `PrettyPrinter._print_BlockMatrix` method deals with the pretty printing of BlockMatrix objects.
