From the provided search results, it's clear that the `BlockMatrix` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py` is a likely culprit. This class includes the method `_entry`, which is responsible for fetching entries from the BlockMatrix based on indices. In the pretty printing module (`sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`), the `_print_MatrixElement` method also appears relevant, as it handles the pretty printing of matrix elements, which could impact the display of the elements in the output. However, the critical method to inspect and potentially modify is `_entry` in the `BlockMatrix` class, as it directly handles how entries are accessed.
