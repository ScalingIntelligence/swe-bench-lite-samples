The expected behavior is that the element at index `C[i, 0]` should not be simplified as it could come from either matrix `A` or `B` within the BlockMatrix `C`. Two main files have been identified as relevant: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. In the `pretty.py` file, the `PrettyPrinter._print_BlockMatrix` method is responsible for the pretty printing of BlockMatrix objects, and it seems to correctly handle block matrices by printing their blocks. In the `matexpr.py` file, the `MatrixExpr.__getitem__` method is responsible for handling element access in matrix expressions, which seems to directly return the element from the matrix without considering the BlockMatrix structure. However, the key part of the issue is likely in the `_entry` method of the BlockMatrix class within the `blockmatrix.py` file, where the actual element retrieval logic resides. This method should correctly identify which block the requested element belongs to and retrieve it from the appropriate matrix (`A` or `B`). The provided search results include the `BlockMatrix` class with the `_entry` method, which should be the focus for addressing the issue of wrongly simplified matrix elements in a BlockMatrix.",
