The user's code shows that when an element C[i, 0] is accessed from a BlockMatrix C, the system incorrectly simplifies it to (A)[i, 0], ignoring the possibility that the element might come from block B. This suggests a need to properly handle indexing within BlockMatrix to ensure all blocks are considered. Given the context of known relevant files and code spans from the printing modules, the next step is to examine the new search results focusing on the BlockMatrix class and related functionalities in sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py. From the search results, it's clear that the BlockMatrix class includes methods and properties related to block shapes, sizes, and operations. Notably, the _entry method in BlockMatrix directly pertains to retrieving an element from the matrix, which seems highly relevant to solving the indexing issue described. The method must correctly map global indices (i, j) to block-specific indices and then fetch the element from the appropriate block. Therefore, the task is to ensure that the _entry method properly implements this logic without over-simplifying based on block positions.",
