The context from sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py suggests it deals with matrix expressions, while the search results in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py include the printing of block matrices. Specifically, the _print_BlockMatrix method in the PrettyPrinter class is pertinent, as it determines how the structure of a BlockMatrix is printed. This is crucial because the issue involves incorrect matrix element identification during printing or accessing operations. The method handles the printing of BlockMatrix by dealing with its blocks, which could be related to the incorrect element access. Therefore, this section of the code is relevant to the problem, as it might be involved in how elements are accessed or represented in the BlockMatrix class.",

The expected behavior is not to simplify the element, as it may come from either `A` or `B`. The relevant code spans identified in the search results include the `__getitem__` method in `MatrixExpr` and the `_entry` method in `BlockMatrix`. These methods are responsible for handling the indexing and element retrieval of the matrix expressions, which are crucial for addressing the issue. Additionally, the `_print_BlockMatrix` method in the PrettyPrinter class is identified, which is related to the pretty printing of the BlockMatrix, although it might not be directly related to the indexing issue, it is relevant for understanding the output representation.",
