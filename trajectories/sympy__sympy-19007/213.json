The relevant code spans need to focus on the BlockMatrix class and its methods, especially those related to how matrix elements are retrieved and how block matrices are handled. Upon examining the search results, the `BlockMatrix._entry` method stands out as it directly deals with retrieving an entry from a BlockMatrix based on indices i and j. This method seems to be the likely culprit for the wrong element being fetched. Additionally, the `block_collapse` function, which is used to collapse matrix expressions involving BlockMatrix, might also be relevant if it is involved in simplifications that could lead to the error observed in the report. Therefore, the identified spans to investigate further are the `BlockMatrix._entry` method and potentially any other parts of the BlockMatrix class or related functions that deal with element retrieval or expression simplification.",
