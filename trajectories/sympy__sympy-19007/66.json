Specifically, when accessing an element C[i, 0] from BlockMatrix C, the result simplifies incorrectly to (A)[i, 0], even though the element could be from either A or B. To address this, we need to focus on the methods related to element access in the BlockMatrix class. The search results include several relevant sections of code: 1. The BlockMatrix class definition in sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py, which includes the _entry method that controls how elements are accessed. 2. The MatrixExpr class definition in sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py, which includes the __getitem__ method, responsible for handling access operations like C[i, 0]. This method ultimately calls the _entry method of the BlockMatrix class. 3. The PrettyPrinter class in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py, although related to printing and not directly to the issue, shows how BlockMatrix objects are printed. The critical section for resolving the issue is in the BlockMatrix._entry method, which needs to be adjusted to ensure it correctly handles the dynamic nature of elements within a BlockMatrix, without prematurely simplifying to elements from the first block only.",

The `_entry` method in `BlockMatrix` class incorrectly simplifies the element when it may come from different parts of the BlockMatrix.
