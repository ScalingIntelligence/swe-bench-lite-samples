The user's code example involves creating a BlockMatrix and accessing an element at a specific position, but the result is not correctly handling whether the element comes from the provided matrices A or B. The search results found the relevant BlockMatrix class and specifically its _entry method, which is responsible for determining the value of an entry given its indices i and j. This method correctly implements the logic to decide whether an element comes from A or B, which indicates it is the main area of interest. Additionally, there are results related to the PrettyPrinter class, which is used for printing SymPy expressions in a human-readable format. The _print_MatrixElement method handles the pretty printing of individual matrix elements, potentially including those from a BlockMatrix, so it's also relevant to the issue as it might affect how elements are presented or simplified. The _print_BlockMatrix method could also be relevant for how BlockMatrix objects are pretty printed in general, although it currently seems more focused on the structure rather than individual element handling. Thus, the identified spans should include those for _entry in BlockMatrix (key logic for element fetching) and possibly _print_MatrixElement for checking if the pretty printing affects the observed behavior.",

The changes now ensure that the element is fetched correctly regardless of its source (A or B). The provided git diff shows the code modifications that fix the issue, and the updated file context indicates the changes are applied in the correct file.
