Specifically, when accessing an element `C[i, 0]` where `C` is a BlockMatrix, the element should not be simplified to belong exclusively to `A` or `B`. It should account for the possibility of the element coming from either block.\n\nLooking at the search results, the `BlockMatrix` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py` contains a method `_entry(self, i, j, **kwargs)` which is responsible for determining the entry in the block matrix. This method iterates over the row and column blocks to find the correct block and then retrieves the element from the respective block. This method seems highly relevant because it directly addresses the determination of which block a matrix element comes from.\n\nThe `MatrixElement` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` is also relevant, particularly the `doit` method, which simplifies the matrix element. This method should be reviewed to ensure it does not prematurely simplify the matrix element in a way that misrepresents its origin within the block matrix.\n\nBased on the content of both files, the `_entry` method in `BlockMatrix` and the `doit` method in `MatrixElement` are identified as relevant code spans for addressing the reported issue.",

Instead, the element should be capable of coming from either `A` or `B`, indicating the need for a proper check to determine which matrix block the element belongs to.\n\nReviewing the file context, we see that there is a method `BlockMatrix._entry` which is relevant as it deals with how to retrieve an entry from the BlockMatrix. This method currently has logic to iterate over row and column blocks to determine the correct matrix block from which to fetch an element.\n\nThe new search results include a section of code in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` which defines the `MatrixElement` class and the `MatrixElement.doit` method. However, this code appears to be related to general matrix elements rather than specific to BlockMatrices. Since the issue pertains to BlockMatrix and its element retrieval, this new code span doesn't directly address the issue at hand.\n\nConsidering the relevance of the `BlockMatrix._entry` method from the file context and the lack of direct relevance of the new code span to BlockMatrix's element retrieval issue, the identified spans remain the same as those initially provided in the file context.",
