The current output shows that the element is being fetched from A, but it could potentially come from either A or B. This suggests a need to improve the way elements are accessed in the BlockMatrix class.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, the most relevant part is the `MatrixExpr._entry` method, which is a base method that raises a `NotImplementedError`. This indicates that it's a placeholder for the actual implementation in derived classes, including `BlockMatrix`. However, `BlockMatrix` likely has its own implementation of `_entry` that needs to be checked and possibly corrected to handle indexing correctly across multiple submatrices.\n\nGiven the current context, it's not possible to directly pinpoint the exact location of the error in the code as the `_entry` method implementation for `BlockMatrix` is not provided. However, based on the report, the error is likely to be in the `__getitem__` method of `BlockMatrix` or a closely related method that determines how individual elements are accessed. These methods need to be careful to consider all possibilities for the source of the element, not just defaulting to assuming it comes from the first submatrix. This suggests a need to analyze and possibly adjust logic in `BlockMatrix` interactions that involve element access.",

This implies that the indexing logic in the BlockMatrix class is flawed. Given the current context and the new search results, the relevant code spans seem to be in the `BlockMatrix` class definition (particularly the `_entry` method) and the `MatrixExpr` class definition in `matexpr.py` (specifically the `__getitem__` method).
