The code provided involves creating a BlockMatrix and attempting to access an element. The issue arises because the access operation simplifies incorrectly, leading to the wrong matrix being accessed. To address this, we need to look into how the __getitem__ and _entry methods are implemented for both MatrixExpr and BlockMatrix classes. The search results provide the relevant code for these methods. For MatrixExpr, the __getitem__ method handles indexing and delegates to _entry for specific element retrieval. The _entry method in MatrixSymbol returns a MatrixElement. For BlockMatrix, the _entry method is overridden to handle the block structure, which is exactly what is needed for the reported issue.",

In 'matexpr.py', the '__getitem__' method for the MatrixExpr class handles various indexing scenarios including slices and single integer indexes, but it does not specifically account for BlockMatrix elements. The MatrixElement class appears to be a generic representation of matrix elements without specific handling for BlockMatrix. In 'blockmatrix.py', the BlockMatrix class has a '_entry' method that is crucial for determining the correct element in a BlockMatrix based on its block structure. This method is used within the '__getitem__' method of MatrixExpr when an instance of BlockMatrix is indexed, suggesting it plays a key role in providing the correct element from BlockMatrix. The '_entry' method iterates through the block structure to find the appropriate block and then retrieves the element from that block, suggesting it correctly handles the block matrix structure.
