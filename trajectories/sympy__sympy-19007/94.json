Specifically, it states that when accessing elements with indices, the result is not coming from the correct sub-matrix A or B but is wrongly simplified to come from A only. The relevant code spans I analyzed are related to BlockMatrix class and its methods, particularly the __new__, shape, blockshape, blocks, rowblocksizes, colblocksizes, structurally_equal, _blockmul, _blockadd, _eval_transpose, _eval_trace, _eval_determinant, as_real_imag, transpose, _entry, is_Identity, is_structurally_symmetric, and equals methods. Additionally, saw methods related to BlockDiagMatrix. The analysis suggests that the _entry method in BlockMatrix might be the central point for debugging as it has the logic to fetch elements based on block indices and might be incorrectly mapping indices to the wrong block, potentially only considering the first block as the right block.",

To resolve this, it would be prudent to implement a custom `__getitem__` method in the `BlockMatrix` class that overrides the default behavior of `MatrixExpr`.
