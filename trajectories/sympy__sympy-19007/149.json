The user provided a code snippet demonstrating that when accessing an element of the BlockMatrix C using C[i, 0], the result is simplified to (A)[i, 0], which is incorrect because the element could be from either A or B. The current search result provides the `__getitem__` method from the MatrixExpr class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. This method is crucial because it defines how matrix elements are accessed. The method checks the index and returns the appropriate entry or raises an IndexError if the indices are invalid. This is highly relevant to the issue at hand because it directly pertains to how elements are accessed in a matrix. Specifically, the method needs to be modified to handle BlockMatrix correctly, ensuring that it doesn't incorrectly simplify the access to a single matrix like A when it should be considering both A and B.",
