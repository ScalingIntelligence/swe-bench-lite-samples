The user provided an example where the element `C[i, 0]` is incorrectly simplified to `(A)[i, 0]`, instead of considering it might come from either `A` or `B`. This suggests an issue with how the BlockMatrix class handles indexing.\n\nUpon examination of the search results, the relevant file is 'sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py', specifically the 'BlockMatrix._entry' span where the _entry method is defined. This method is responsible for determining the correct element in the BlockMatrix based on the given indices. This is likely the location where the issue may be occurring.\n\nAdditionally, in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py', the 'MatrixExpr.__getitem__' span indicates how indexing on the MatrixExpr class, which BlockMatrix inherits from, is implemented. This could also be a relevant area to check for issues related to how block matrices handle element access.\n\nGiven these findings, I will identify the relevant spans to address the reported issue.",
