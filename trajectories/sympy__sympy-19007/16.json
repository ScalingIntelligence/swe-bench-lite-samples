The user provided a code snippet where a BlockMatrix is defined with submatrices A and B, and when accessing an element via indexing, the result is incorrectly simplified to an element from A. The expected behavior is for the element to come from either A or B depending on the indices. The relevant part of the codebase is likely in the `BlockMatrix` class and its methods, particularly the `_entry` method, as this method determines the matrix element at a given position. The `_entry` method iterates over the blocks' sizes to determine the correct element. This method needs to be checked for correctness to ensure it doesn't incorrectly simplify the element based on the indices. Therefore, the identified code spans are those related to the `BlockMatrix` class and the `_entry` method.",
