Specifically, when accessing an element C[i, 0] where C is a BlockMatrix composed of smaller matrices A and B, the result should not assume the element comes from A alone. \n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py and sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py. In blockmatrix.py, the BlockMatrix class and its _entry method are central, as this method handles the indexing of elements in the BlockMatrix. The matexpr.py file contains the definition of MatrixElement and MatrixSymbol, which are used in the _entry methods of both BlockMatrix and MatrixSymbol. \n\nThe BlockMatrix._entry method is particularly relevant as it directs the indexing to the correct sub-matrix within the BlockMatrix. However, it needs to be checked if it correctly handles the scenario where the indices could refer to different sub-matrices. The MatrixSymbol._entry method, while not directly related to BlockMatrix, is also crucial as it defines how individual matrix symbols should handle element access, which will influence how BlockMatrix delegates its element access.\n\nThese identified code spans should help in diagnosing why the incorrect matrix element is being fetched and potentially guide fixes to handle the matrix element access correctly across different sub-matrices in a BlockMatrix.",
