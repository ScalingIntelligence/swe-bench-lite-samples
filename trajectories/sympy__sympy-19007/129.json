The user's code example demonstrates that the element from the BlockMatrix is being erroneously simplified to an element from a specific sub-matrix (A), whereas it should be able to represent elements from either sub-matrix (A or B) based on the index. To address this, I need to examine the methods responsible for handling element access in the BlockMatrix class. In the provided search results, the `BlockMatrix._entry` method in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py' seems highly relevant as it defines how elements are retrieved from the BlockMatrix. Additionally, the method `MatrixExpr.__getitem__` within 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' is also important as it handles the indexing operation, which leads to the invocation of the `_entry` method in BlockMatrix. Both these segments of code need to be considered to determine the root cause and potential fix for the issue. Therefore, I will select these two specific code spans for further analysis.",

Given the issue's description, it seems like the fault lies in how the `_entry` method determines the block and fetches the element. However, the file context does not include the entire logic for `BlockMatrix` class, so it's unclear if other parts of the class affect the behavior. Also, the `__getitem__` method in `MatrixExpr` is handling slice operations and single index operations, which might also somehow interfere with the block matrix's element fetching.

The BlockMatrix class and its methods, such as _entry, _eval_transpose, and __getitem__, are present and seem to handle the block structure and element retrieval. The MatrixExpr class also includes the __getitem__ method, which interacts with BlockMatrix to fetch elements, and includes logic for handling slices and non-integer indices. These elements collectively cover the necessary functionality to understand and potentially rectify the issue described where the wrong matrix element is fetched from BlockMatrix. Therefore, based on the available context, it seems sufficient to assess the relevant code for the reported issue.",
