This can be achieved by adding appropriate type checks in the `__matmul__` method. The relevant methods and classes are spread across several files, including `common.py`, `matexpr.py`, `dense.py`, `expressions/matmul.py`, and others. It's necessary to focus the search on these files and the `__matmul__` method to identify where the type checks need to be added or modified. Additional context suggests that the issue might be with how the method is currently defined or how it interacts with other methods like `__mul__`. Thus, the search should also consider checking instances where `__matmul__` might be inadvertently using or being conflated with `__mul__`.",

Currently, the `__matmul__` method in the `MatrixArithmetic` class directly calls `__mul__`, which may not enforce the strict matrix multiplication rule as required by the issue. The provided search results show that `__matmul__` is indeed implemented to call `__mul__` without additional checks. Additionally, the `__mul__` method itself performs a variety of operations depending on the type of `other`, including scalar multiplication if `other` is not a `Matrix` or `MatrixLike` object. This behavior could be the source of the issue where a non-matrix operand could unintentionally result in a matrix multiplication. To resolve this, modifications to the `__matmul__` method would be necessary to ensure it strictly checks that both operands are matrices before proceeding with matrix multiplication.",
