The current implementation in `MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__` simply calls `self.__mul__(other)`, which does not enforce the matrix multiplication constraint. The search results contain several key files and functions that could be relevant to addressing this issue: \n\n1. `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py` contains the `MatMul` class, which is likely responsible for matrix multiplication operations. The `__new__` method and `validate` function within this class could be utilized to enforce valid matrix multiplication operations. \n\n2. The `validate` function in `matmul.py` currently checks for compatible matrix shapes and raises a `ShapeError` if they are not aligned. This function could be extended to also check the type of operands to ensure they are matrices. \n\n3. The `hadamard.py` file also contains a `validate` function, but it is specific to Hadamard products and checks for compatible shapes as well. However, since the issue pertains to matrix multiplication, this function is less relevant. \n\n4. The `matadd.py` file contains `MatAdd` and its `validate` function, which focuses on matrix addition. This is not directly relevant to the matrix multiplication issue at hand. \n\nGiven these findings, the most pertinent code to address the reported issue is located in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py`, particularly the `MatMul` class and its `__new__` method as well as the `validate` function.
