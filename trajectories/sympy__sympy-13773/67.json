Additionally, `MatrixExpr` directly uses `MatMul` for matrix multiplication, which is a more specific class that likely includes proper operand checks. To ensure comprehensive coverage, the search should expand to include not only the direct implementations of `__matmul__`, but also the `MatMul` class or any custom validation functions used within the `sympy.matrices` module.
