This discrepancy needs to be addressed. Upon examining the provided code spans, it's clear that the `__matmul__` method currently returns the result of `__mul__`. This doesn't enforce the specific requirement for matrix multiplication. The `__mul__` method handles various types of multiplications, including scalar multiplication, which shouldn't be allowed for matrix multiplication. Relevant code includes the `__matmul__` method itself, the `__mul__` method, and the `_matrixify` function that checks the type of the matrix, which might help in determining the actual type of the operand. However, a more specific check should be implemented within `__matmul__` to ensure that the operation only proceeds if both operands are matrices (and can be multiplied in a matrix sense).

This is evidenced by the example where a scalar operand is allowed in matrix multiplication, which contradicts typical matrix behavior in libraries like NumPy. The current file context and search results both point to the `MatrixArithmetic` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py`, which contains the `__matmul__` method. The task is to ensure that `__matmul__` correctly validates that both operands are matrices before performing the multiplication, similar to how `__mul__` checks for shape compatibility but with stricter type checks. It's critical to maintain proper handling of shape mismatches as demonstrated in `__mul__`. The relevant spans to address this issue include those for `__matmul__`, `__mul__`, and potentially `_eval_matrix_mul` to understand the multiplication logic and where type checks might need adjustment.",
