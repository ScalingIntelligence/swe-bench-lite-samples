Currently, the `__matmul__` method in `MatrixArithmetic` just calls `__mul__`, which is not specific to matrix multiplication. However, the `__mul__` method does perform checks to ensure that the multiplication is possible based on the shapes of matrices. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue would be those defining and implementing `__matmul__` and `__mul__` in both `MatrixArithmetic` and `MatrixExpr` classes, as well as the `_matrixify` function that converts inputs to a matrix-like object if necessary. This would allow for possible modifications or additional checks within `__matmul__` to ensure it only works for true matrix multiplication.",

In `MatrixArithmetic`, `__matmul__` simply calls `__mul__`, which could be an issue since it doesn't differentiate between matrix multiplication and scalar multiplication. However, the check for matrix shape in `__mul__` ensures that the operation is valid only if the dimensions match for matrix multiplication. In `MatrixExpr`, `__matmul__` is correctly implemented to use `MatMul`. While the code in `sympy/matrices/common.py` does not explicitly fail for scalar operands, it does handle matrix shapes correctly, suggesting that further checks for scalar operands in `__matmul__` might be needed. The file context seems comprehensive for addressing the issue, but additional checks specifically for scalar operands in `__matmul__` would be necessary to fully resolve the issue.",
