The current implementation of `__matmul__` just calls `__mul__`, which might not enforce the proper type checks for matrix multiplication. Moreover, the `__rmatmul__` and `__rmul__` methods are also involved in the operation but don't seem to have specific checks for matrix types. The `MatMul` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py` handles matrix multiplication expressions but doesn't directly relate to runtime type checks on operands.
