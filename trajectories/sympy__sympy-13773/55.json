The current implementation of `__matmul__` in both `MatrixArithmetic` and `MatrixExpr` classes just copies the behavior of `__mul__`, which does not align with the requirement to handle matrix multiplication specifically. This suggests that the current implementation needs to be modified to add a check for the types of operands to ensure that both are matrices before performing the operation. The relevant code spans are in `sympy/matrices/common.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, specifically the `__matmul__` methods in the `MatrixArithmetic` and `MatrixExpr` classes. It would also be beneficial to review any utility functions or helper classes that could be used to implement the type checking, such as the `a2idx` function and `classof` function for type comparison, found in `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`. Additionally, the `MatrixBase` class provides helper methods like `key2bounds` and `key2ij` that could be relevant if the checks need to interact with the dimensions or keys of matrices.",
