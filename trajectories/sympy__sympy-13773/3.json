The current implementation in SymPy's `MatrixArithmetic` and `MatrixExpr` classes simply copies the `__mul__` method for `__matmul__`. This behavior does not align with the requirement that `__matmul__` should specifically enforce matrix multiplication. To address this issue, the `__matmul__` methods in both classes need to be updated to verify that both operands are indeed matrices before performing the multiplication. By doing so, we can prevent scalar operands from being mistakenly used with `@`, as seen in the examples where a scalar on the left-hand side of `@` with a matrix on the right-hand side should raise an error.",
