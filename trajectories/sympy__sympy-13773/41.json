The search results reveal that `__mul__` does some checking for matrix shapes, but it doesn't specifically handle the case where one operand is not a matrix. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue would include both `MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__` and `MatrixArithmetic.__mul__` to ensure the correct behavior.
