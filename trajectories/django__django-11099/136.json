However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n"
