The expected behavior is that no members should be documented, but the actual behavior is that all members are documented despite the empty `__all__` list. To resolve this, it is necessary to investigate how autodoc handles the `__all__` attribute and specifically how it processes and interprets an empty list. The primary focus should be on the `ModuleDocumenter` class within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module, as this class is responsible for processing module-level documentation. Additionally, the `filter_members` method within the `Documenter` class should also be examined, as it likely plays a role in determining which members to document.",

I will focus on the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its methods, particularly `__init__` and `get_object_members`, as these are directly related to how members of a module are documented. The `__init__` method sets `self.__all__` to None, which might be a part of the problem. The `get_object_members` method checks the `__all__` attribute to determine which members to document. If `__all__` is not set, it defaults to documenting all members, which is likely where the issue arises. This analysis aligns with the reported issue and the provided context.",

The `__init__` method sets `self.__all__` to `None` initially and relies on `merge_members_option` for handling member options. The `get_object_members` method is the critical area where `self.__all__`'s content influences which members are included in the documentation. If `self.__all__` is `None`, it defaults to including all members; however, if `self.__all__` is an actual list (empty or not), it filters members based on this list. The code does not explicitly handle an empty `self.__all__`, leading to the issue where all members are still documented when `__all__` is intended to exclude them all. This oversight needs a specific check for an empty `self.__all__` list to exclude all members effectively.",
