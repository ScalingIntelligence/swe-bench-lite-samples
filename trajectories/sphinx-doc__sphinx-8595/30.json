The codebase analysis reveals that the `ModuleDocumenter` class is responsible for documenting modules. It initializes the `__all__` attribute as `None` in its constructor, but there's no handling for the case where `__all__` is an empty list, which might explain why these members are not being filtered out. The `filter_members` method within the `Documenter` class is crucial for determining which members to document, but it lacks explicit handling for an empty `__all__` attribute. The current context includes this method, which suggests it might be the right place to implement a check for the `__all__` attribute. Additionally, the `setup` function registers various autodocumenters including `ModuleDocumenter`, but it does not directly address the issue at hand.
