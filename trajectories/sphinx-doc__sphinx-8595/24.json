The expected behavior is that no members should be shown because `__all__` is empty. To address this, we need to focus on the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its related methods, particularly where it handles the `members` option and filtering members. The relevant code spans seem to be the `ModuleDocumenter` class definition, the `__init__` method of `ModuleDocumenter` where `__all__` is initialized, and the `Documenter.filter_members` method where members are filtered. The `merge_members_option` function is also important as it handles the merging of member options.

It's pertinent to further analyze how the `__all__` attribute impacts the filtering process, as it's not directly referenced within the `filter_members` function. However, the `members` option can be dynamically set through methods like `merge_members_option`, which could be a relevant foundation for serendipitous research, especially considering the integration with Classes.
