Considering the provided context, more likely investigations can be made more confidently on this precise area mainly in `get_object_members`, specifically for the `__all__` handling but likely involved members specially around the module loading and filtering logics hence another step could involve deeper attention to the detailed functions of the Sphinx extension that overseen around those loogics.",

If `__all__` is set, it filters members based on their presence in `__all__`, thereby effectively controlling the documentation output of module members.

If `__all__` is not set, all members are allowed; otherwise, it filters based on `__all__`. However, the handling of an empty `__all__` list is not explicitly addressed. Additionally, the `merge_members_option` function configures member options, which could indirectly impact how `__all__` is processed. Furthermore, the `document_members` method of the `Documenter` class is likely involved in the actual documentation process, thus connecting the parsing and rendering stages.
