The expected behavior is that when `__all__` is empty, no module members should be documented. To address this, we need to examine how `__all__` is used and how members are filtered in the `ModuleDocumenter` class and potentially in other parts of the autodoc functionality.\n\n1. **ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members**: This method is critical as it determines which members to document. The code checks if `__all__` exists and uses it to filter members. If `__all__` is empty, it should logically result in no members being documented.\n\n2. **Documenter.filter_members**: This method filters members based on various criteria, including whether they are documented, private, or explicitly excluded. It does not directly reference `__all__`, but understanding how members are ultimately filtered could provide insight into why an empty `__all__` is not preventing documentation.\n\n3. **inspect.getall**: This function retrieves the `__all__` attribute from a module. Its purpose is to ensure the attribute exists and is a list of strings. This function is used to determine which members to include from a module based on `__all__`.\n\n4. **Documenter class**: The base class for all documenters. It initializes various attributes and sets up the environment for documenting objects. Understanding how the base class operates can provide context for the inheritance and functionality provided by subclasses like `ModuleDocumenter`.\n\nGiven these points, the relevant spans are:\n- `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` for the main logic concerning `__all__`.\n- `Documenter.filter_members` to understand the broader context of member filtering.\n- `inspect.getall` for how `__all__` is retrieved and validated.\n- `ModuleDocumenter.__init__` and `Documenter.__init__` to understand how the documenter is initialized.\n\nThese spans should provide a comprehensive view of how the `__all__` attribute is handled and where the expected behavior is not met, leading to the bug report.",

The `getall` function in `sphinx/util/inspect.py` is used to safely retrieve the `__all__` attribute, but there is no explicit handling for the case where `__all__` is empty.

However, the logic in `get_object_members` appears to need a specific check for an empty `__all__` to ensure no members are documented in such cases.
