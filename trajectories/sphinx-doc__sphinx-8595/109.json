The relevant code is likely in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file, specifically in the `ModuleDocumenter` class or related methods such as `get_object_members` or `filter_members`.

This means that even when `__all__` is explicitly set to an empty list, all members of the module are still being documented. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior, which is to document no members when `__all__` is empty.\n\nReviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found in the `ModuleDocumenter` class within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. Specifically, the `get_object_members` method of `ModuleDocumenter` is responsible for determining which members to document. It checks the `__all__` attribute of the module to decide whether to include certain members. However, the current implementation does not account for the case where `__all__` is empty, which is why all members are being documented regardless of the `__all__` attribute.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to identify and correct the logic in `get_object_members` to properly respect an empty `__all__` attribute. The current implementation returns all members if `__all__` is None. This could be the point of failure. Implementing a check for an empty `__all__` and returning an empty list of members in such a case should resolve the reported issue.\n\nRelevant code spans for further investigation and potential correction include the `ModuleDocumenter.__init__` span to understand how `__all__` is initialized and the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` span which needs to be adjusted to account for an empty `__all__`.",
