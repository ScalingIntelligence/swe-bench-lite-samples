However, in the provided examples, all members (`foo`, `bar`, `baz`) are still being documented. The relevant code spans in the search results that handle the behavior of `__all__` include the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its method `import_object`, which attempts to retrieve `__all__` from the module. Additionally, the `getall` function in `sphinx/util/inspect.py` is responsible for safely retrieving `__all__` and ensuring that it is a list of strings. These sections of code are crucial for understanding and implementing the desired behavior when `__all__` is empty. The `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class also plays a role in deciding which members to include in the documentation, based on the `__all__` attribute. By examining these code spans, we can determine how to adjust the behavior so that an empty `__all__` results in no members being documented.",

The logic in `filter_members` does not explicitly check for an empty `__all__` attribute and does not seem to skip documenting members when `__all__` is empty. This oversight is likely the cause of the observed issue: members are documented even when `__all__` is empty. The `getall` function in `sphinx/util/inspect.py` retrieves the `__all__` attribute for the member filtering process, and it should be used in `filter_members` to handle the empty `__all__` case appropriately.",
