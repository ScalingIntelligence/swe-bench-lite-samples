According to the bug description, despite `__all__` being empty, all functions (foo, bar, baz) are still documented. The expected behavior is that no entries should be shown when `__all__` is empty. This discrepancy suggests that the logic responsible for honoring the `__all__` attribute might be faulty or missing. The key files to focus on would be those directly related to autodoc, particularly the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its methods responsible for processing module members. Additionally, the `filter_members` method within the `Documenter` class might also be pertinent as it is likely involved in deciding which members to document. Therefore, the search should target these specific parts of the autodoc extension to pinpoint where the `__all__` attribute is being ignored.",

The method does not currently check if `__all__` is empty. The related method `filter_members` helps in filtering members to be documented based on various criteria. The `ModuleDocumenter` subclass of `Documenter` also has a `get_object_members` method which processes module members, but it too does not explicitly account for an empty `__all__` attribute.
