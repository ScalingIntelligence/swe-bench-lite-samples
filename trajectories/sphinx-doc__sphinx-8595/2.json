The primary areas of interest are methods related to fetching and filtering members of a module or object, which are central to how `autodoc` processes documentation. Specifically, the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method was examined to understand how it processes the `__all__` attribute and member inclusion logic. This method checks the `__all__` attribute to determine if members should be skipped based on its contents. Given this, the identified code spans are 'ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members' and 'Documenter.filter_members', as these directly relate to managing which members are included in the documentation output based on whether the `__all__` attribute is empty or not.",

The expected behavior is that no members should be shown, but currently, all members (`foo`, `bar`, and `baz`) are shown despite `__all__` being empty. The search results provided include the implementation of `ModuleDocumenter` which inherits from `Documenter`. This class is responsible for documenting modules. The key method here is `get_object_members` which determines which members to document. It checks if `__all__` is not set, and if so, it doesn't filter members based on `__all__`. However, there's no specific check for an empty `__all__` list to enforce the behavior described in the issue. This suggests that adding a check for an empty `__all__` list in the `get_object_members` method could be a potential solution to address the issue.

This suggests that the method does attempt to respect `__all__`, but further investigation is needed to ensure that an empty `__all__` leads to no members being documented. Additionally, the `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class does not directly inspect `__all__`. To address the issue, it would be beneficial to add explicit checks for an empty `__all__` that lead to all members being skipped. This should be done both in `get_object_members` and possibly adjusted in `filter_members` if necessary to ensure consistency in handling the empty `__all__` scenario.",

The issue pertains to how the `__all__` attribute is processed in the `ModuleDocumenter` class within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension. The `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method is crucial for determining which members of a module are documented. The method checks the `self.__all__` attribute to decide whether to include specific members. However, when `self.__all__` is empty, it appears that all members are still processed, contrary to the expected behavior. This behavior is fundamentally linked to the logic within the `get_object_members` method. It is essential to focus on this part of the code to ensure that when `__all__` is empty, no members are documented, aligning with the expected behavior as described in the issue.",
