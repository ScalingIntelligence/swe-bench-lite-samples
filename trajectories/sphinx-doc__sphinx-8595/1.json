According to the bug report, autodoc ignores an empty `__all__` attribute and still documents all functions. The expected behavior is that no entries should be shown because `__all__` is empty. To address this, it's necessary to examine the `ModuleDocumenter` class and the `filter_members` method, which are responsible for handling `__all__` and determining which members to document. Therefore, searching for these specific components within the autodoc extension files will likely yield the relevant code to investigate and potentially fix the issue.",

The search results provide several relevant code spans that handle member filtering and documentation generation in `sphinx.ext.autodoc`. Specifically, the `Documenter.filter_members` method and `ModuleDocumenter` class are crucial for understanding how members are filtered and documented. These sections of code handle the logic for including or excluding members based on various options and conditions, including the `__all__` attribute. Further examination of these sections is necessary to identify where and how the `__all__` attribute might be handled or potentially ignored. Additionally, the `ModuleDocumenter.__init__` method includes a merge_members_option call, which might also be relevant to the issue.",
