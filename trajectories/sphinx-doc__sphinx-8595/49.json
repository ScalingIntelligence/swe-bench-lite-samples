This results in all members of the module being documented, despite `__all__` being empty. The relevant section of code is likely within the `ModuleDocumenter` class or its methods since it is responsible for documenting modules. Specifically, the `get_object_members` method is of interest as it retrieves members of the module, potentially ignoring the `__all__` attribute. Additionally, the `filter_members` method might also play a role in deciding which members to document. An investigation into these methods could reveal how `__all__` is or isn't being considered.",

This suggests that `__all__` is intended to be used for determining which members should be documented. However, the initial concern was that an empty `__all__` was being ignored, which might imply a bug in the handling of empty lists or perhaps a separate configuration option might affect this behavior.

The code spans provided in the current context, especially `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`, show part of the logic related to `__all__`. By diving into the new search results, it's essential to find more related code, such as how `__all__` is imported and used. In the search results, relevant spans include `ModuleDocumenter.__init__`, `ModuleDocumenter.import_object`, and `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`, which expose the method where `__all__` is accessed, validated, and used to filter members. This confirms that `ModuleDocumenter` is likely the main class responsible for the behavior described in the issue.

This suggests that `__all__` is intended to be used for determining which members should be documented. However, the initial concern was that an empty `__all__` was being ignored, which might imply a bug in the handling of empty lists or perhaps a separate configuration option might affect this behavior.
