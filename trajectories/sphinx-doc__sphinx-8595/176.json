This is particularly focused on the behavior of ModuleDocumenter when the __all__ attribute is empty. When the __all__ attribute is empty, it should restrict the documentation output to show no entries. However, the current behavior shows all members, which is incorrect. The relevant code spans to address this issue are primarily found in the ModuleDocumenter class, especially its __init__ and get_object_members methods. The __init__ method initializes the __all__ attribute and the get_object_members method determines which members should be documented. By analyzing the get_object_members method, we can see that it checks if the __all__ attribute is None and then decides whether to show implicit module members or filter based on the __all__ attribute. The issue suggests that when __all__ is empty, nothing should be shown, which is not currently implemented. To fix this, we need to ensure that an empty __all__ attribute results in no members being documented.",
