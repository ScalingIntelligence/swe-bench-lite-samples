This suggests that the logic responsible for handling `__all__` during the documentation generation process might contain a bug or lack proper handling for empty lists. The search should focus on the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its methods, particularly those involved in processing members of a module, such as `get_object_members`, `filter_members`, or `document_members`. Additionally, the `_All` class and its `__contains__` method might be relevant as it seems to be used for membership testing. The exact code snippet related to handling `__all__` should also be included in the search.",

Specifically, when `__all__` is empty, the expected behavior is that no entries should be shown, but in the reported case, all members are being shown regardless. To address this, the relevant code spans must be analyzed to understand how the members are being filtered and documented. The search results provided include several files and spans, notably in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, which contains classes and methods related to documenting members and handling options like `members` and `inherited_members`. The `ModuleDocumenter` class is particularly relevant as it directly handles the `__all__` attribute when importing objects and managing members. The `get_object_members` and `sort_members` methods within `ModuleDocumenter` are key as they manage the inclusion of members based on `__all__` and other options. Additionally, the `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class processes members based on various criteria including `__all__`. By analyzing these spans, we can pinpoint where the logic for respecting the `__all__` attribute might be failing or where adjustments need to be made. The spans that are directly handling the `__all__` attribute and the logic for including or excluding members are considered relevant to the reported issue. However, further analysis may be needed to understand how other options like `members` and `inherited_members` interact with `__all__` to ensure all relevant aspects of the issue are addressed.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the `__all__` attribute being ignored by autodoc, which should ideally restrict the members documented when empty. The file context provided initially includes several parts of the code related to the handling of `__all__`, specifically in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. The key sections are `Documenter.get_object_members`, `ModuleDocumenter.import_object`, and `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`.\n\nIn the new search results, the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method is particularly relevant as it deals directly with the logic around `__all__`. This method checks if `__all__` is present and filters members based on its content. This aligns closely with the issue reported, which concerns the handling of the `__all__` attribute. Given that the initial context and the new search results both involve methods that process and respect (or supposedly respect) `__all__`, it appears that the provided code spans are sufficiently relevant to the issue at hand. They contain the necessary logic for determining which members should be documented based on `__all__`.\n\nStep-by-step justification for identifying relevant spans:\n1. The `__all__` variable is a list of public names of a module by convention, and it is used by `sphinx.ext.autodoc` to control which members are documented.\n2. The `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method checks if `__all__` is present and uses it to filter members, which directly addresses the reported issue.\n3. The initial context and the new search results both focus on methods that involve the logic around `__all__`, which suggests these sections are crucial to the functionality affected by the bug.\n\nThe relevance of the identified spans lies in their direct handling of the `__all__` attribute, which is central to the functionality described in the reported issue. The provided code appears to be sufficient for addressing the issue, as it covers the necessary logic for respecting the `__all__` attribute.",

However, there is no explicit handling for the scenario where `__all__` is an empty list.
