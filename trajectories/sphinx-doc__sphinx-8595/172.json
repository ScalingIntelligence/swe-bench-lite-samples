According to the bug description, members (e.g., foo, bar, baz) are still being documented even though `__all__` is explicitly set to an empty list, which should prevent any members from being documented. This behavior suggests a potential issue in the logic that processes the `__all__` attribute in the ModuleDocumenter class or related classes within the sphinx.ext.autodoc module. Therefore, the focus should be on identifying how the `__all__` attribute is being handled and how the members are filtered or documented in these classes.",

This attribute is supposed to limit the members that are documented when the module is processed by autodoc. The key elements to focus on are the handling of the `__all__` attribute and the filtering of members in the autodoc process.\n\nI first examined the `Documenter` class and its subclasses, particularly the `ModuleDocumenter`, as these are central to the autodoc functionality. In the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method, I found the handling of the `__all__` attribute. The method checks if `__all__` is defined and filters members based on its contents. This section appears relevant to the issue as it directly involves the `__all__` attribute. I also identified the `filter_members` method in the `Documenter` class, which refines the list of members based on various criteria, including the `__all__` attribute. This method is critical in determining which members to document, so it's also relevant.\n\nHowever, it seems that the code might not be correctly handling the case where `__all__` is empty, which could lead to all members being documented regardless. To address the issue, the code responsible for checking and applying the `__all__` attribute in the `Documenter` and `ModuleDocumenter` classes needs to be carefully reviewed and possibly corrected to ensure that an empty `__all__` results in no members being documented.",

The expected behavior is that no members should be documented when `__all__` is empty. However, in the provided example, all members (foo, bar, baz) are still shown. This discrepancy suggests that the logic for handling empty `__all__` might be incomplete or incorrect. The search results focus on the `ModuleDocumenter` class within the autodoc extension, which is responsible for documenting modules. The relevant method here is `get_object_members`, which decides which members to include based on the `__all__` attribute. The analysis shows that when `__all__` is not provided (implicit members), all members are included. When `__all__` is provided, members not listed in `__all__` are marked as skipped. This logic should also apply when `__all__` is explicitly set to an empty list, but it seems this case isn't adequately handled, leading to the reported issue. The solution might involve adding a check for an empty `__all__` list to ensure no members are documented in this scenario.",

The new search results provide additional context in the form of the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its methods, particularly `__init__` and `get_object_members`. These methods are crucial as they deal with the initialization of the `__all__` attribute and the logic for determining which members to document based on `__all__`. Specifically, the `get_object_members` method handles the logic for checking if `__all__` is not None and then skips members not listed in `__all__` if it is not empty.
