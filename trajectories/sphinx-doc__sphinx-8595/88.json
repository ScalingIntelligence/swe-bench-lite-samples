This suggests a need to investigate how autodoc processes and responds to the `__all__` attribute during documentation generation. The search results include several relevant sections of the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file:\n\n1. The `merge_members_option` function deals with merging member options and checks if specific members are to be included or excluded.\n\n2. The `Documenter` class and its methods, particularly `filter_members`, handle the filtering of members based on various criteria, including docstrings, private members, and special members.\n\n3. The `ModuleDocumenter` class, a subclass of `Documenter`, handles the documentation of modules and includes handling for `__all__` via the `__init__` method where it calls `merge_members_option`.\n\n4. The `setup` function configures various autodoc settings and documenters, including `ModuleDocumenter`, relevant for setting up the environment for documentation generation.\n\nGiven these details, the relevant code spans include those that directly handle or influence how members are included in documentation, especially in relation to the `__all__` attribute. The `ModuleDocumenter` class and its `__init__` method, along with the `filter_members` method of the `Documenter` class, are particularly relevant for addressing the issue of the empty `__all__` attribute being ignored.",
