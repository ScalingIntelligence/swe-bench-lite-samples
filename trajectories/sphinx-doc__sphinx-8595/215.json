The issue indicates that even when `__all__` is empty, all members (foo, bar, baz) are still shown, which suggests a possible gap in the logic that respects `__all__`. \n\nWe also see a reference to `merge_members_option`, which might influence how members are treated. The `ModuleDocumenter` class seems relevant as it specifically handles modules and their members.

To address this issue, it's important to identify the code responsible for handling the `__all__` attribute in the context of module documentation. Upon examining the search results, it's clear that the `ModuleDocumenter` class, which is responsible for documenting modules, does store the `__all__` attribute internally but does not appear to use it in the `filter_members` method in a way that would respect an empty `__all__`. This lack of usage could be the cause of the issue, as it implies that the autodoc extension isn't checking the `__all__` attribute to determine which members to document when it's empty. To fix this issue, there may need to be modifications to how `Documenter.filter_members` processes the members list when the module has an empty `__all__`.
