The provided file context and search results point to relevant code spans that deal with the processing of module members and the handling of the `__all__` attribute. Specifically, the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its methods `__init__` and `get_object_members` are central to this issue. In the `__init__` method, the `__all__` attribute is initialized, and in the `get_object_members` method, it is used to filter members based on its contents. The search results include additional relevant spans such as the base `Documenter` class and its `get_object_members` method, as well as the `ClassDocumenter` class and its `get_object_members` method, which provide context on how member documentation is handled more broadly in the autodoc extension. These code spans collectively provide a thorough understanding of how the `__all__` attribute is currently managed and how module members are documented, which is essential for addressing the reported issue.",
