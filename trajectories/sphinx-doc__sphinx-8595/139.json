To address this, it's crucial to identify where and how `__all__` is evaluated in the context of autodoc. The search results provide several relevant spans, particularly in the `ModuleDocumenter` class and its methods like `get_object_members`. These methods are responsible for determining which members should be documented. For example, in the `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method, the evaluation of `__all__` is critical. If `__all__` is not found, it defaults to including all members, which seems to align with the observed bug.
