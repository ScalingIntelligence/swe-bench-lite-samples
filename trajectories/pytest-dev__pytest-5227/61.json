The current format uses just the base filename, and it's suggested to include the module name or an abbreviated path for better clarity. Given the context, it seems likely that the relevant code will be found in files related to logging or configuration within the project. The `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` variable, which sets the logging format, should be the primary focus. A search for this variable or similar code patterns can help identify the areas requiring changes. Multiple search requests are justified to cover different potential configurations or settings for logging, ensuring all relevant files are considered.",
