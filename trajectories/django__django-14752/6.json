This involves modifying the `AutocompleteJsonView.get` method to introduce an extension point for customizing the results serialization. The current `AutocompleteJsonView.get` method directly constructs the JSON response, making it difficult to extend. As suggested, moving the result serialization code into a separate method would make the class more extensible. The provided search results include the `AutocompleteJsonView` class and its `get` method, which directly aligns with the issue. The code currently uses a hardcoded way to construct the results within `get`, which matches the original problem statement. Therefore, the identified code span includes the `get` method from `AutocompleteJsonView` as it needs to be refactored to include an extension point for customizing result serialization, adhering to the proposed solution.",

The current implementation constructs the results for the `JsonResponse` directly within the `get` method, making it difficult to extend without duplicating significant code. The proposed solution is to extract the part of the method responsible for constructing the results into a separate method called `serialize_result`, which can then be overridden in custom implementations to add extra fields to the results. The provided search results include the relevant parts of the `AutocompleteJsonView` class, specifically the `get` method and other parts of the class that interact with this method. The current context already includes the `get` method, which constructs the results without an extension point. The new search results confirm this and provide additional context with other methods in the class, such as `get_paginator`, `get_queryset`, `process_request`, and `has_perm`. However, none of these methods directly address the need for an extension point. Therefore, the task is to identify where this extension point or new method could be added within the `AutocompleteJsonView` class to achieve the desired refactoring. The proposed solution aligns with the need to create a new method (`serialize_result`) within the `AutocompleteJsonView` class that can be overridden for customization. Given the context and search results, the identified relevant code spans are from the `AutocompleteJsonView` class within `django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py`, specifically the `get` method, which is where the new extension point should be added.",

  "initial_message": "Refactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by mrts)\n\t \nAdding data attributes to items in ordinary non-autocomplete foreign key fields that use forms.widgets.Select-based widgets is relatively easy. This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable? I'm more than happy to provide the patch.\n"
