The current approach requires extending and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method, which leads to maintenance overhead. A proposed solution is to introduce a new method `serialize_result` that constructs the results. This method can be easily overridden to add custom fields. The current context suggests that the relevant files are in the django/contrib/admin directory, specifically focusing on views and widgets. The AutocompleteJsonView is located in `django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py`, and related widgets are in `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py`. The search should focus on these files and look for methods related to JSON response construction and result serialization.",

The issue suggests creating a new method, `serialize_result`, to encapsulate the logic for converting objects into JSON format. This would allow for easier customization and maintenance in future implementations. The current implementation of AutocompleteJsonView.get() contains the logic for constructing the results within the JsonResponse constructor, which aligns closely with the proposed change. The relevant code spans from the search results that are particularly useful include the entire `AutocompleteJsonView` class and its methods, especially `get`, which is the method that directly constructs the JSON response. Additionally, the `process_request` method is relevant for understanding how the request is processed in order to determine the permission and query parameters for the autocomplete search. This analysis shows that the provided search results contain all the necessary code spans to address the reported issue and implement the suggested refactoring.",

We also need to determine where a new method, such as serialize_result, could be introduced or overridden to customize the serialization of results without fully overriding the get method. The current implementation of the get method in AutocompleteJsonView constructs the results directly within the JsonResponse. To make the code maintainable and allow for customizations like adding extra fields, moving this part of the code to a separate method like serialize_result would be beneficial. The search results show the relevant sections of AutocompleteJsonView, including the get method and other related methods like get_queryset and process_request. This context is essential for understanding where and how to refactor the code. Given the context and search results, the identified spans include the entire get method and potentially a new span for the serialize_result method if it were to be implemented.

  "initial_message": "Refactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by mrts)\n\t \nAdding data attributes to items in ordinary non-autocomplete foreign key fields that use forms.widgets.Select-based widgets is relatively easy. This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable? I'm more than happy to provide the patch.\n"
