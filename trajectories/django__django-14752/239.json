The main problem is that currently, extending AutocompleteJsonView to add new attributes to autocomplete field results requires fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method, which leads to maintenance overhead as the method evolves. The proposed solution is to add a customization extension point in the form of a serialize_result() method to make it easier to extend the response without needing to override the entire get() method. The provided context suggests that the relevant code spans could be within django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py and potentially related files where AutocompleteJsonView is defined or used. Given the complexity of the tasks let's just search for some general keywords to get started.",

The suggested solution involves introducing a `serialize_result()` method that constructs the result dictionary for each object, making it easier to customize the response without modifying the core `get()` method. To implement this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle constructing the JSON response for the autocomplete view.\n\nThe analysis of the search results shows that the `AutocompleteJsonView` class is indeed responsible for handling autocomplete requests in the Django admin. The `get()` method constructs the JSON response, which currently includes only 'id' and 'text' for each object. This method is a perfect candidate for refactoring to introduce the `serialize_result()` method as suggested in the issue. The other methods like `get_queryset()`, `get_paginator()`, and `process_request()` are related to permissions, fetching query results, and initializing the request data, respectively, but they do not directly impact the structure of the JSON response.\n\nBased on the issue and the provided search results, the `get()` method within `AutocompleteJsonView` should be refactored to include a call to `self.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name)` for each object in the result list. This change would allow for easy customization of the JSON response, which aligns with the proposed solution in the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Refactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by mrts)\n\t \nAdding data attributes to items in ordinary non-autocomplete foreign key fields that use forms.widgets.Select-based widgets is relatively easy. This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable? I'm more than happy to provide the patch.\n"
