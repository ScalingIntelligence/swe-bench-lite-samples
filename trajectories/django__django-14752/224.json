The main concern is the maintenance overhead of fully overriding the `get()` method. The proposed solution is to introduce a `serialize_result()` method that can be overridden easily to add extra fields. Given the provided context, it's clear that the relevant code is within the Django admin views and widgets, particularly the `AutocompleteJsonView` class. Therefore, focusing the search on `autocomplete.py` and related files within the `django/contrib/admin` directory would be most efficient. Additionally, identifying any existing customizations or overrides of `AutocompleteJsonView` in third-party or project-specific code could also be beneficial.",

Notably, the 'get' method of AutocompleteJsonView includes the current logic for generating the results, which aligns with the need for refactoring as outlined in the issue. Specifically, the section identified by 'AutocompleteJsonView.get' contains the fragment of code that constructs the results in the JsonResponse.

The solution proposed is to move the lines constructing the results to a separate method, such as serialize_result(). This change would simplify customizations and reduce maintenance effort.

The current implementation of the get method in AutocompleteJsonView constructs the results for the JsonResponse inline. The suggested solution involves moving this construction to a separate method, serialize_result, to allow for easier customization without fully overriding the get method. The search results contain the relevant parts of AutocompleteJsonView, including the current implementation of the get method and other methods like process_request, get_queryset, and has_perm, which are closely related to the functionality of the get method and might need updates if the structure of the get response changes. However, the search results do not include the proposed serialize_result method or any attempt at the suggested refactoring. The task is complete in the sense that the relevant parts of the codebase related to the reported issue have been identified. However, the actual refactoring solution, including the addition of the serialize_result method, is not present in the search results.",

The method mentioned in the issue overrides the `get()` method to customize the autocomplete response by adding additional fields. However, the current implementation lacks the `serialize_result()` method, which is key to allowing maintainable customizations without the need to override the entire `get()` method. Given that the search results were not relevant, further investigation is needed into the exact location of the `get()` method and whether there are existing attempts to introduce the `serialize_result()` method in custom implementations or third-party extensions. Additionally, checking for discussions or pending pull requests related to this issue could provide more insights into community efforts around this enhancement.",

  "initial_message": "Refactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by mrts)\n\t \nAdding data attributes to items in ordinary non-autocomplete foreign key fields that use forms.widgets.Select-based widgets is relatively easy. This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable? I'm more than happy to provide the patch.\n"
