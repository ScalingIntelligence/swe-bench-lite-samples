The current approach requires full overriding of the get() method, which leads to maintenance overhead as the method evolves. The proposed solution is to introduce a serialize_result() method that encapsulates the object-to-dictionary conversion logic, making it easier to customize without fully overriding the get() method. The provided context indicates a potential location for AutocompleteJsonView in django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py. Based on this, the search parameters should focus on AutocompleteJsonView and the get() method to locate the specific code snippet that constructs the results in the JsonResponse.",

The primary focus is on enhancing customizability without complete method overrides, specifically by introducing a `serialize_result` method for result customization.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant file is `django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py`, particularly the `AutocompleteJsonView` class. Within this class, the `get` method constructs the results inside the `JsonResponse` and currently lacks a customizable extension point as suggested in the issue. To address the issue, it is proposed to move the results construction code to a separate `serialize_result` method, which would allow for easy customization by subclasses.\n\nThe provided code span from the `AutocompleteJsonView.get` method includes the part where the results are currently constructed, which directly relates to the issue's requirement for refactoring. Therefore, this code span is identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

The proposed solution involves adding a result customization extension point by moving the code that constructs the results inside the JsonResponse constructor to a separate method called `serialize_result()`. This allows for easier customization and reduces maintenance overhead as the AutocompleteJsonView evolves.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code, we see that the current implementation of `AutocompleteJsonView.get()` method constructs the results inside the JsonResponse constructor without using a separate method for serialization, which aligns with the issue's description. The new search results confirm the presence of this implementation in the `django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py` file.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the proposed solution, the current code implementation within the `get` method of `AutocompleteJsonView` is relevant as it directly relates to the part of the code that needs to be refactored to support extra fields. Additionally, the presence of methods like `get_paginator`, `get_queryset`, `process_request`, and `has_perm` in the `AutocompleteJsonView` class is also relevant as they are part of the larger context of handling autocomplete functionality.\n\nGiven the context and the relevance of the provided code spans to the reported issue, the search task can be considered complete with the identified relevant code spans.",

This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable?
