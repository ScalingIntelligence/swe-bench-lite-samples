The proposed solution is to introduce a new method, serialize_result, which encapsulates the logic for converting an object to a dictionary. This makes it easier to extend the response without overriding the entire get method. The relevant files identified in the context are primarily in the django/contrib/admin directory, specifically focusing on views, widgets, and options. The search should prioritize this directory to locate the AutocompleteJsonView class and related methods.",

The issue suggests creating a new method, serialize_result(), to handle the conversion of objects to dictionaries, making it easier to customize the serialization without overriding the entire get() method.\n\nThe provided search results contain the relevant part of the codebase. The file 'django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py' contains the AutocompleteJsonView class, which includes the get() method. This method is currently responsible for constructing the JSON response, including the 'results' list where objects are converted to dictionaries. This part of the code closely matches the current implementation described in the issue.\n\nBased on the issue description and the search results, the identified code spans (specifically the get() method in the AutocompleteJsonView class) are relevant to the reported issue.

  "initial_message": "Refactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by mrts)\n\t \nAdding data attributes to items in ordinary non-autocomplete foreign key fields that use forms.widgets.Select-based widgets is relatively easy. This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable? I'm more than happy to provide the patch.\n"
