This is in order to reduce maintenance overhead as the AutocompleteJsonView.get method evolves. The search results provide the entire context of the AutocompleteJsonView class, including the get method and other related methods. The relevant code spans are identified as the entire class since the issue involves modifying the existing class to introduce a new customization point, specifically a serialize_result method. This method would be responsible for converting objects to dictionaries, allowing for easy extension with additional fields. The change would involve moving the dictionary construction code out of the existing get method into this new method. The CustomAutocompleteJsonView example provided in the issue would then override this method to add the extra fields, simplifying the extension process. Therefore, the entirety of the AutocompleteJsonView class is relevant for this refactoring task.",

The current implementation customizes the response by modifying the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. This approach is problematic due to maintenance overhead, as the method keeps evolving. The proposed solution involves introducing a customization point by moving the result construction logic to a separate method named serialize_result(). This method would be easier to override, making the code more maintainable and succinct. The search results provide the complete context of the AutocompleteJsonView class, including the current implementation of the get() method, which constructs the results directly within the JsonResponse. The other methods are related to processing the request, checking permissions, and obtaining the queryset. These provide context but are not directly related to the reported issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those related to the get() method, particularly the part where the results are constructed, as this is the focus of the refactoring.",

This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable? I'm more than happy to provide the patch.\n"
