            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue seeks to refactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response, aiming to mitigate maintenance overhead related to keeping custom overrides aligned with the evolving base class implementation. The suggested solution involves introducing an extension point within the `AutocompleteJsonView.get()` method by moving the code that constructs the results into a separate method, `serialize_result()`, to allow for easier customization. This approach aligns with the current implementation of `AutocompleteJsonView` found in the search results. Specifically, the search results highlight the necessity to modify the `AutocompleteJsonView.get()` method and incrementally implement the proposed solution. The provided `AutocompleteJsonView.get()` method currently constructs JSON response objects without extension points, which is precisely the issue the reported issue aims to address. The search results do not explicitly include a `serialize_result()` method or an equivalent extension point, indicating that the actual implementation of this solution in the codebase is currently missing or not readily findable. However, adapting the existing code to support this change is feasible. By introducing a `serialize_result()` method that encapsulates the existing result serialization logic, we can provide a clean extension point for customization as outlined in the reported issue. Doing so not only simplifies future customizations but also enables the injection of custom behavior (e.g., adding new fields like `'notes'`) without altering or replicating the core logic of `AutocompleteJsonView.get()`. Therefore, the identified relevant code span is the `AutocompleteJsonView.get()` method within the specified file path.",

The current implementation of `get` constructs the JsonResponse directly in a way that makes it hard to extend without significant duplication or modification. The solution proposed in the issue is to extract the construction of the results array into a separate method `serialize_result()`. This would allow for easier customization of the response by subclassing `AutocompleteJsonView`. The relevant code spans identified are those related to the `get` method and would include adding the new `serialize_result` method. Additionally, the `CustomAutocompleteJsonView` example provided in the issue shows how this new method can be overridden to add custom fields to the response. The existing `get` method in the `AutocompleteJsonView` needs to be modified to call this new method within the JsonResponse constructor.",

  "initial_message": "Refactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by mrts)\n\t \nAdding data attributes to items in ordinary non-autocomplete foreign key fields that use forms.widgets.Select-based widgets is relatively easy. This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.\nHowever, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results currently requires extending contrib.admin.views.autocomplete.AutocompleteJsonView and fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method. Here's an example:\nclass MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tdef get_urls(self):\n\t\treturn [\n\t\t\tpath('autocomplete/', CustomAutocompleteJsonView.as_view(admin_site=self.admin_site))\n\t\t\tif url.pattern.match('autocomplete/')\n\t\t\telse url for url in super().get_urls()\n\t\t]\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n\t\tself.term, self.model_admin, self.source_field, to_field_name = self.process_request(request)\n\t\tif not self.has_perm(request):\n\t\t\traise PermissionDenied\n\t\tself.object_list = self.get_queryset()\n\t\tcontext = self.get_context_data()\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj), 'notes': obj.notes} # <-- customization here\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nThe problem with this is that as AutocompleteJsonView.get() keeps evolving, there's quite a lot of maintenance overhead required to catch up.\nThe solutions is simple, side-effect- and risk-free: adding a result customization extension point to get() by moving the lines that construct the results inside JsonResponse constructor to a separate method. So instead of\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\t{'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\n\t\t\t\tfor obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nthere would be\n\t\treturn JsonResponse({\n\t\t\t'results': [\n\t\t\t\tself.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) for obj in context['object_list']\n\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t'pagination': {'more': context['page_obj'].has_next()},\n\t\t})\nwhere serialize_result() contains the original object to dictionary conversion code that would be now easy to override:\ndef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\treturn {'id': str(getattr(obj, to_field_name)), 'text': str(obj)}\nThe example CustomAutocompleteJsonView from above would now become succinct and maintainable:\nclass CustomAutocompleteJsonView(AutocompleteJsonView):\n\tdef serialize_result(self, obj, to_field_name):\n\t\treturn super.serialize_result(obj, to_field_name) | {'notes': obj.notes}\nWhat do you think, is this acceptable? I'm more than happy to provide the patch.\n"
