The error indicates a problem specific to pickling the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object, suggesting that the issue might be related to how the canvas or the figure is being handled during pickling. The search results include spans from `Figure`, `Artist`, and `DraggableBase`. The `Figure.__getstate__` and `Figure.__setstate__` methods are particularly relevant because they deal directly with the pickling process, suggesting that the issue might lie in how the figure and its components (like the canvas) are being handled during serialization. Additionally, the `DraggableBase` class, which manages the draggable functionality of artists like legends and annotations, could play a role if the pickling process does not handle such artists correctly. Thus, highlighting these spans provides a relevant starting point for addressing the issue reported.",

Given the context of the error, the relevant code spans should relate to the pickling process of a figure and any specific handling related to draggable legends or annotations. There are several potentially relevant code spans identified:\n\n1. In the `Figure` class from `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, methods `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` handle the pickling and unpickling of the figure. Notably, the `__getstate__` method removes the canvas from the state to be pickled.\n2. The `Artist` class from `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` includes a `__getstate__` method that could potentially impact the pickling process.\n3. The `DraggableBase` class from `lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py` manages the behavior of draggable objects on the figure canvas, which could interact with pickling.\n4. The `FigureCanvasQT` class from `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_qt.py` is associated with the canvas and could play a role in the pickling operation since the error mentions `'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object`.\n\nGiven these code spans, it appears that the pickling process might be hindered by the presence of the canvas object, which seems to be explicitly omitted from the state to be pickled. Additionally, handling for draggable elements might not be properly accounted for in the pickling method, leading to the reported error.\n\nOur search is likely complete as we have found code spans that directly address the pickling of figures, the handling of the canvas object, and the behavior of draggable elements, all of which are relevant to the reported issue.",

This is related to the serialization process, specifically focusing on the `Figure` class and its related components in Matplotlib. The search results yield the `FigureCanvasQT` class in the `backend_qt.py` file, which contains code pertinent to the event handling and rendering of the figure in a Qt-based backend. This class intersects with the issue as it involves the figure's canvas and its ability to handle various events, including the serialization process which is failing due to the mentioned error. In analyzing the search results, the following spans within 'backend_qt.py' are particularly relevant: the 'FigureCanvasQT.__init__' span, as it initializes the canvas; 'FigureCanvasQT.blit' span, used for optimizing rendering; 'FigureCanvasQT.__getstate__' and 'FigureCanvasQT.__setstate__', key for managing the serialization process; and 'set_cursor', 'enterEvent', 'leaveEvent', 'mousePressEvent', 'mouseMoveEvent', and 'mouseReleaseEvent' which handle mouse interactions related to the draggable legend and annotations.\n\nThese spans provide insight into the canvas' interaction with the Qt backend and the figure's serialization methods, making them highly relevant to addressing the reported issue of pickling a figure with draggable components. The provided spans cover the initialization, event handling, and serialization aspects of the FigureCanvas in a Qt environment, which are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the issue.",

Specifically, figure.py contains the Figure class with methods for pickling (__getstate__ and __setstate__) and the initialization of the figure with draggable properties like legend and annotations. The artist.py file contains the Artist class, which is foundational for all visuals in matplotlib, including legends and annotations. The offsetbox.py file contains the DraggableBase class, which could be relevant for the draggable functionality. The backend_qt.py file contains the FigureCanvasQT class, which is likely responsible for the actual rendering and interaction of the figure. This comprehensive context suggests that the relevant code necessary to understand and potentially address the pickling issue with draggable legends and annotations is largely present. However, direct implementations or modifications needed to handle pickling with draggable elements might still be missing, but the class structures and interaction points are well-defined in the provided files.",
