The draggable legend might be causing the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object to be included in the pickling process, leading to the TypeError. To address this, we should focus our search on the __getstate__ method in the relevant classes, particularly those related to Figure and Artist, as these are the base classes where pickling behavior might be defined or overridden. Also, considering the draggable functionality, we might need to investigate classes related to draggable components and their integration with the Figure and Artist classes.",

The error message indicates that the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object cannot be pickled. This suggests that the issue lies in how the figure and its components are being serialized. Reviewing the provided code spans, the most relevant sections appear to be those dealing with the `Figure` class and its pickling methods (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`), particularly in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`. Additionally, the `Artist` class and its pickling method in `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` might also be relevant as the legend and annotations are likely instances of this class. The `DraggableBase` class in `lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py`, which handles the draggable functionality, could also impact the pickling process as it involves modifying the state of the figure. Identifying these sections should help in understanding and potentially fixing the pickling issue.",

In the Figure class, the __getstate__ method cleverly removes the 'canvas' property from the state being pickled, which is likely due to the canvas not being pickleable. This aligns with the error message encountered in the issue, which specifically mentions 'FigureCanvasQTAgg'. The Artist class also customizes its state during pickling, but notably omits '_stale_callback'. Focusing on the driftgable components, the DraggableBase class does not directly reference 'FigureCanvasQTAgg', but it initializes a 'canvas' property from the 'ref_artist'. Since the error arises during the pickling process, it is crucial to ensure that no non-picklable objects (like a canvas) are included in the state being serialized. Further investigation should focus on the interaction between the draggable components and the figure's canvas during the pickling process.",

To address this, it's crucial to examine code related to figure pickling, as well as the integration of draggable components like legends and annotations. The existing context includes relevant sections from 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py', focusing on Figure and Artist classes, particularly their __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods. The new search results reveal additional code spans that may be pertinent, such as the DraggableBase, DraggableOffsetBox, and DraggableAnnotation classes from 'lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py' which could affect pickling if they modify the figure state. Furthermore, the 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/cbook.py' files also contain __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods that might play a role in pickling axes and callback registries, respectively. These additional files and spans expand our understanding of how draggable elements might interact with pickling and could provide clues to resolve the reported issue. The analysis suggests that the search task is likely complete as we have identified potential areas of concern and relevant code spans across multiple files.",

This aligns with the error message encountered in the issue, which specifically mentions 'FigureCanvasQTAgg'.

Focusing on the driftgable components, the DraggableBase class does not directly reference 'FigureCanvasQTAgg', but it initializes a 'canvas' property from the 'ref_artist'.
