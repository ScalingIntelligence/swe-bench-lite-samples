However, neither the Figure nor Artist classes directly address the issue of pickling a draggable legend, which raises concerns about backend-specific objects like 'FigureCanvasQTAgg'. The error message indicates that this object cannot be pickled, suggesting a deeper issue in the backend handling of the canvas and its objects. This issue is likely handled in backend-specific files such as backend_qt.py, but this specific file is not provided in the context.
