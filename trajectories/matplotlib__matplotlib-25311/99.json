Specifically, we should focus on the spans within the lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_qtagg.py file that deal with the FigureCanvasQTAgg class and its methods like paintEvent and print_figure, as these methods are fundamental to the rendering and output of the figure, which is crucial for the pickling process. Additionally, we should consider the spans in the lib/matplotlib/figure.py file that deal with the Figure class, particularly the __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods, which are directly involved in the pickling and unpickling of the figure.
