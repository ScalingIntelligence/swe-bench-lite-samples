This issue is related to the pickling functionality and suggests that there might be an issue with the state of the objects being pickled. The search results provide several files (`lib/matplotlib/artist.py`, `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`, and `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`) and relevant spans within those files. These spans include methods such as `__getstate__`, `__setstate__`, and `__init__` which are critical for pickling and unpickling objects in Python. Specifically, `__getstate__` is used to determine what data gets pickled, and `__setstate__` is used to restore this state when unpickling. The presence of `FigureCanvasQTAgg` in the error suggests that the canvas object of the figure is not being handled correctly during the pickling process. These methods in the provided spans are likely candidates for fixing the issue, as they handle the object's state, which is crucial for pickling compatibility.",
