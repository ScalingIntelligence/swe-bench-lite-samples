The search results include a detailed look at the 'Figure' class in matplotlib's figure.py. The 'Figure.__init__' span provides insights into how the Figure object is initialized, which includes setting draggable properties and handling layout engines. The 'Figure.__getstate__' span is particularly relevant as it outlines how the Figure object is prepared for pickling. This span explicitly removes the 'canvas' attribute from the state, which might be causing the TypeError when attempting to pickle the entire Figure including its canvas. These spans provide a direct correlation to the reported issue, addressing the initialization and serialization of Figure objects, which are central to resolving the pickling error. Therefore, these spans are highly relevant to the reported issue.",

The error message specifically mentions a 'TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object'. This suggests that the problem is related to the canvas object in the figure which cannot be pickled due to its state. The provided file context shows parts of the Figure class from matplotlib, including the init method and the getstate method. These methods are crucial for understanding how figures are initialized and pickled. The new search results provide insights into the DraggableBase class which is likely related to the draggable functionality of matplotlib elements like legends and annotations. This class includes methods for handling pick events, motion, and release, indicating its close association with the interactive parts of the figure that are causing the pickling issue. The code spans related to the DraggableBase class, especially those handling pick and release events, are highly relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue. They provide the necessary context for how draggable elements interact with the canvas and figure, which is directly linked to the pickling error. Therefore, these spans should be considered relevant and included in the identified spans.",

The relevant parts of the code base include the Figure class and the DraggableBase class. The __getstate__ method in the Figure class is crucial for understanding how the figure is serialized during pickling. It removes the 'canvas' attribute from the state to avoid pickling non-picklable objects. The DraggableBase class, responsible for making artists draggable, uses callbacks for handling drag events, which might be related to the pickling issue due to the potential for including non-picklable objects in its state. The new search results include additional methods from the Figure class such as `pick`, `draw_without_rendering`, `draw_artist`, and `__setstate__`, but none directly address the pickling issue or the handling of draggable elements. The relevant code spans from the initial search still seem most pertinent, especially those in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` concerning the Figure class's state management (particularly the __getstate__ method) and in `lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py` regarding the DraggableBase class's initialization and event-handling for draggable elements.",
