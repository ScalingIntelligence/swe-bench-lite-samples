This likely involves understanding how the Figure and Artist classes in Matplotlib handle pickling. The search results provide several key spans in the Figure class (such as __init__, draw_without_rendering, draw_artist, and __getstate__) and in the Artist class (such as __init__ and __getstate__). These spans are crucial for understanding the initialization, drawing, and state management of figures and artists, which are directly related to the pickling functionality. Specifically, the __getstate__ method in both classes is significant as it defines how the object's state is saved. Given these findings, it appears that the provided code spans are relevant to the reported issue. However, it would be beneficial to inspect the implementation of the draggable legend functionality and its interaction with the Figure and Artist classes for a more comprehensive resolution.",
