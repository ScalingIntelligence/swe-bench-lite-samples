These sections include the '__getstate__' methods in the 'Artist', '_AxesBase', and 'Figure' classes, which are responsible for custom pickling. Additionally, the 'Artist' class and its '__init__' method could be relevant, as they deal with the underlying structure of the figure, axes, and artists. The '_AxesBase' class and its '__init__' method also set up the axes and deal with attributes that could affect pickling.
