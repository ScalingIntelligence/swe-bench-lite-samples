By analyzing the provided search results, we can see that there are several key sections of code that might be relevant to this issue. First, the code in 'lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_qt.py' contains the 'FigureCanvasQT' class, which indicates a Qt backend canvas and might be related to the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' error. Additionally, there are several methods within this class such as '__init__', 'draw', and 'blit' which could be involved in the figure rendering process and its interaction with the legend and annotations. Second, in 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py', the 'Figure' class and its methods appear to handle figure creation and management, including the 'pick' method which involves handling mouse interactions and the '__getstate__' method which is related to pickling. Lastly, in 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py', the 'Artist' class appears to be the base class for all objects that can be drawn in a figure. The method '__getstate__' is defined here but doesn't directly reference pickling the canvas, focusing instead on artist properties.",

This suggests a need to focus on the `Figure` and `Artist` classes within `matplotlib`, particularly on their `__getstate__` and `pickle`-related methods. The current file context already provides a good starting point with relevant sections from `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` and `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`. The new search results confirm and expand on this context, particularly in the handling of the `Figure` class initialization and state management. It's evident that the current implementations of `__getstate__` in both `Figure` and `Artist` might need adjustments to handle the draggable legend and annotation states during pickling. Based on the issue description and the provided search results, the relevant code spans to address this issue should be extracted from the file `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, focusing on the `Figure.__init__`, `Figure.__getstate__`, and potentially related properties or methods involved in state management and canvas/legend interactions.

It's likely that the root issue is not with the initialization or drawing methods but with the serialization logic that handles the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object, especially in relation to draggable elements like legends and annotations. The '__reduce__' method, which is crucial for the pickling process, is not explicitly implemented in the provided search results. This suggests the need for a deeper investigation into serialization strategies, possibly extending beyond the initial classes targeted.",

The `Figure` class in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` and its `__getstate__` method, which is crucial for pickling.\n3.
