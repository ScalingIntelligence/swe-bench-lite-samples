The error specifically mentions the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object. To resolve this, we need to investigate how the pickling process handles the figure and its associated components, especially the draggable legend. The provided context includes several files from the Matplotlib library, but none directly address the pickling issue with the draggable legend. To proceed, a focused search on the pickling mechanism and how it interacts with various components like legends and annotations in the figure is required. This search should look for specific functions or methods related to pickling in the context of figures, especially those involving the canvas or backend.",

This indicates a need to identify and address how the draggable legend interacts with the rest of the figure's state during pickling. The search results provide various components of the Matplotlib library with special methods for pickling (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`). These include the `Figure`, `Artist`, `Axes`, and others. Each of these has a method to return a state dictionary during pickling. This setup is essential for correctly serializing and deserializing these objects.
