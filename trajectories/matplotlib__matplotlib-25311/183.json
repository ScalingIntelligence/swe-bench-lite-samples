This error is likely due to the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object not being picklable. The search results include several files and code spans that might contain relevant code to address this issue. The `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class in `backend_qtagg.py` and the `Legend` class in `legend.py` are potential candidates for containing the relevant code. Specifically, the `__getstate__` methods in several classes (Artist, _AxesBase, Figure, Text, TransformNode) suggest that these classes might be involved in the pickling process. Additionally, the `draggable` parameter in the `Legend` class's `__init__` method indicates whether the legend can be dragged with the mouse, which is directly related to the reported issue. The `FigureCanvasQTAgg.paintEvent` and `FigureCanvasQTAgg.print_figure` methods might also be relevant since they handle painting and printing of the figure, respectively.

Additionally, the Legend class in legend.py includes details on the draggable functionality, which is relevant to the issue mentioned. However, the file context does not directly include the specific pickling logic that might be causing the TypeError. It is common for pickling issues to arise due to the interaction of complex objects, like graphical components, with the pickling process. To properly address this issue, reviewing the pickling logic in the broader context of matplotlib, including how Figure, Artist, and other related classes handle pickling, would be essential. Thus, while the context provides some relevant code for understanding the issue, it does not cover all aspects necessary for a complete solution.",

This suggests that the issue lies within the pickling process of the FigureCanvasQTAgg object or any related objects that are part of the figure and involved in the draggable legend. Reviewing the provided file context and search results, several relevant code spans have been identified: 1. 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' class definition and its 'paintEvent' method, which is part of the backend_qtagg.py file and related to the Qt backend handling of the figure canvas. 2. '__getstate__' methods in the 'Artist' class and its subclasses ('_AxesBase', 'Figure', 'Text', 'TransformNode'), which are involved in the pickling process. 3. The '__init__' method of the 'Figure' class, which initializes the figure object and its properties, including the canvas. These code spans are crucial for understanding how the figure and its components, especially the canvas and legend, are being handled and their state during pickling. The search task appears to be complete based on the provided context, as the relevant code spans from the issue description have been identified.",
