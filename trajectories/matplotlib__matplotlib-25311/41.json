The error message directly references this class.\n-> File: lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_qtagg.py\n   - `RendererAgg` related methods: Specifically `RendererAgg.__getstate__` and `RendererAgg.__setstate__`, handling the pickling of Renderer objects.\n-> File: lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py\n\n4. **Callback Registry Handling for Dynamic Elements:**\n   - `CallbackRegistry`'s `__getstate__` and `__setstate__`: Methods that handle the serialization of callback registries, crucial for dynamic elements like legends.\n-> File: lib/matplotlib/cbook.py\n\n5. **Text and Image Handling:**\n   - `Text.__getstate__` and `_ImageBase.__getstate__`: Classes that might be part of the legend and could be affected during pickling.\n-> Files: lib/matplotlib/text.py, lib/matplotlib/image.py\n\n### Rationale for Selecting the Identified Spans:\nThese spans were selected because they directly address core functionalities tied to pickling, especially in the context of Figure properties, which may also include dynamic elements like draggable legends. They also reflect backend-specific considerations relevant to the error mentioned.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, it is anticipated that either a solution or further insights into the cause of the pickling error will be obtainable.",
