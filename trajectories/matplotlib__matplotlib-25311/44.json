The Figure class is central to the issue as it encapsulates the functionality related to creating and managing figures. The sections of code that handle the pickling process, such as __getstate__ in the Figure class, are particularly relevant as they directly deal with the serialization of the figure object. Additionally, the FigureCanvasAgg class in the backend_agg.py file is relevant as it is responsible for the canvas rendering, which is closely tied to the figure object and could be a source of the pickling issue.
