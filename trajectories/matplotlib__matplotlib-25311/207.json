The search results provide several relevant code spans that could be related to this issue:\n\n1. In `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`, the `Artist` class and its `__getstate__` method are relevant as they deal with the state of artists, which could be part of the draggable legend.\n2. In `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, the `Figure` class and its `__getstate__` method are crucial as they directly handle the state of the figure being pickled.\n3. In `lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py`, the `DraggableBase` class and its methods (`__init__`, `on_motion`, `on_pick`, `on_release`, `_check_still_parented`, `disconnect`, `save_offset`, `update_offset`, `finalize_offset`) are highly relevant as they manage the behavior of draggable elements.

To address this, we need to examine the code related to pickling figures and draggable legends in the Matplotlib library. From the provided file context and search results, several key areas of interest are identified: \n1. `Artist.__getstate__` and `Figure.__getstate__`: These methods are crucial for pickling the figure. The `Artist.__getstate__` method might need to be extended to handle the draggable legend's state, and `Figure.__getstate__` needs to ensure all necessary state is captured without attempting to pickle non-picklable objects like `FigureCanvasQTAgg`. \n2. `DraggableBase` and its subclasses (`DraggableOffsetBox`, `DraggableAnnotation`): These classes handle the draggable functionality, and their state needs to be managed carefully to ensure it can be pickled. \n3. `FigureCanvasQTAgg`: This class is associated with the `TypeError`, indicating that the canvas object might be included in the pickling process where it shouldn't be. The pickling process should exclude such objects. \nBy focusing on these areas, we can identify and specify the relevant code spans that need to be addressed to resolve the pickling issue.",

Furthermore, the `DraggableBase` class and its subclasses (`DraggableOffsetBox`, `DraggableAnnotation`) in the `offsetbox.py` module manage the draggable properties of annotations and offset boxes, potentially interacting with the pickling process. The `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class in the `backend_qtagg.py` module is the Qt-based backend for rendering the figures, and understanding how it interacts with the pickling process is key to solving the issue.
