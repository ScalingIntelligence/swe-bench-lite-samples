The code provided shows that the error arises when trying to pickle the figure after setting the legend to be draggable. The relevant method for pickling seems to be '__getstate__' in the context of Figure, Artist, and _AxesBase classes. However, the specific error mentions 'FigureCanvasQTAgg', suggesting an issue with the backend's canvas object being involved in the pickling process. Therefore, it would be most relevant and efficient to focus the search on methods related to pickling in these classes and the specific backend canvas handling draggable legends.",

The error message indicates that the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object cannot be pickled. To address this, we need to focus on the methods and classes related to pickling in the Matplotlib codebase. Specifically, we are looking for the '__getstate__' method which is responsible for customizing the pickling behavior of an object. Additionally, we should look for any relevant methods or attributes in the Figure, Artist, and _AxesBase classes that might be involved in the pickling process or interact with the canvas or legend. The search results provide several relevant code spans that could be related to the pickling issue: \n1. 'FigureCanvasAgg' class and its methods like 'draw', 'get_renderer', and 'print_raw'. These methods are involved in drawing and rendering the figure, which might indirectly affect pickling if the renderer or canvas state is not serializable. \n2. The 'Figure' class and its '__getstate__' method. This method is crucial as it customizes what state is saved when pickling a figure. The method removes 'canvas' from the state which addresses directly part of the error message about the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object not being picklable. \n3. The 'Artist' class and its '__getstate__' method. This method could be related to pickling any artist object within the figure, including legends and annotations.\n4. The '_AxesBase' class and its '__getstate__' and '__setstate__' methods. These methods manage the state of axes, which can also include legends and other artists, and thus could be relevant to the pickling issue. These findings indicate that the issue is not just with the canvas but likely involves how the state of the figure, including its artists, is managed during pickling. The provided 'Identify' function will return these spans as identified relevant code to the reported issue.",
