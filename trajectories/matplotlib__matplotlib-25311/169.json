This suggests that the problem lies within the pickling mechanism or the interaction between the figure and its draggable components. The relevant classes and functions to investigate are those involved in pickling, figure management, and draggable legend functionality. Given the error message, it's clear that the FigureCanvasQTAgg object is not pickleable, so focus should be on the figure and canvas classes. Additionally, checking how draggable legends are implemented and how they interact with the figure during pickling is crucial.",

Also, details on how draggable legends are implemented are not explicitly covered, though the DraggableBase class is mentioned, it's not clear if it relates directly to legends.

The need is for successful pickling, which indicates a problem with the pickling process of the FigureCanvasQTAgg object. The `Artist` and `Figure` classes in `matplotlib.artist` and `matplotlib.figure` modules have `__getstate__` methods that exclude non-picklable attributes like `stale_callback` and `canvas` respectively. The search results lead me to believe that the relevant code spans that potentially address the pickling issue might be found in the `__getstate__` methods of classes like `Artist`, `Figure`, `Axes`, and possibly `FigureCanvasQTAgg`. Notably, `FigureCanvasQTAgg` does not have a `__getstate__` method defined in the provided context or search results, suggesting that this might be a crucial area to investigate further. Additionally, the pickling process itself involves managing non-picklable objects which should be removed or handled differently during serialization. The `FigureCanvasQTAgg` class in `backend_qtagg.py` seems critical for implementing a solution here, and we must explore how to handle the FigureCanvasQTAgg object during pickling to avoid the TypeError.",
