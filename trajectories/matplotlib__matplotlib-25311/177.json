Given the error message and the context provided, it's clear that the problem arises due to the attempt to pickle an object of type 'FigureCanvasQTAgg', which seems to be unsupported or improperly handled in the current implementation. This suggests that the relevant code might be found within the 'matplotlib' library, particularly in files related to figure handling, canvas handling, and the pickling process. Therefore, focusing on these areas within the 'matplotlib' library would be prudent.",

The relevant code spans identified in the file_context involve the Figure class methods __init__ and __getstate__, which are crucial for object initialization and serialization, respectively. The search results highlight the FigureCanvasQTAgg class, which is the specific canvas type in question, and its parent classes and backend implementations.

This suggests that the issue lies in the serialization process of the figure, specifically when dealing with the canvas backend 'FigureCanvasQTAgg'. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the pickling of the figure and the integration of the backend canvas 'FigureCanvasQTAgg'. From the provided file context and search results, we see several relevant files and spans of code that deal with the figure pickling process and the use of 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' in the backend. Specifically, the 'Figure' class in 'matplotlib/figure.py' has a '__getstate__' method that excludes the 'canvas' attribute during pickling, which is crucial for handling pickling of the figure. Additionally, the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' class in 'matplotlib/backends/backend_qtagg.py' is responsible for the backend canvas operations specific to the QtAgg backend. These sections of the code are directly relevant to the reported issue as they deal with the pickling process and the specific backend integration. Therefore, the identified spans focus on these areas to provide a comprehensive view of the issue's context.",

This directly correlates with the error, indicating that the canvas is not being appropriately handled during the pickling process. Furthermore, the 'FigureCanvasAgg' class in 'backend_agg.py' lacks methods for '__getstate__' or '__setstate__', indicating that it does not handle its own pickling. These findings confirm the initial suspicion that the canvas handling during pickling is likely the source of the issue. The backend files 'backend_qt.py' and 'backend_qtagg.py' show classes that might interact closely with the canvas but do not explicitly address pickling issues. Expanding the search to more broadly include functions and classes dealing with figure canvases and serialization in these files could illuminate potential solutions or further complications.",
