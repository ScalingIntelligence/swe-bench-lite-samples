This corresponds with the actual outcome provided of a TypeError specifically related to the FigureCanvasQTAgg object being unpickleable. The search results have provided several spans of code from the backend_qt.py module that are directly related to the Qt backend's handling of figure canvases, events, and particularly the FigureCanvasQT class. These spans include initialization, event handling (like mouse and keyboard events), and interaction with the Qt widget systems like updating the screen and drawing capabilities. This context is highly pertinent as it involves the direct interaction between Matplotlib's Figure and the Qt backend, where one likely source of the pickling challenge lies in making these dynamic, interactive Qt components serializable. The spans found within the search results, specifically related to initializing FigureCanvasQT, updating pixel ratio for high-DPI displays, handling cursor events, and managing the backend event loop, provide a comprehensive snapshot of the class's complexities in integrating with the Qt UI framework. These pieces of code, especially focusing on how Matplotlib's Figure is being managed and displayed in a Qt environment, could potentially offer deeper insights into or lead to solutions for the specific pickling issues. Therefore, these code spans are deemed highly relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the reported issue.",
