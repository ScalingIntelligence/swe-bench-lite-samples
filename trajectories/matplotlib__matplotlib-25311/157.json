The error suggests that the pickling process is not properly handling the FigureCanvasQTAgg, which is likely related to how the draggable legend is integrated or managed within the Figure object. To resolve this, it's crucial to first locate the specific implementations of the legend and draggable functionality within Matplotlib's source code. This includes focusing on the Figure class and its interaction with the legend, and potentially the backend where the FigureCanvasQTAgg is defined. Given the context provided, we can narrow down the search to the Figure class, backend implementations, and the legend interaction.",
