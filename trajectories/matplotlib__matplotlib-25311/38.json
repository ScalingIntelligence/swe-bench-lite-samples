To address this, we need to look for code spans that handle the pickling process or specifically relate to the `Figure`, `Artist`, or `Legend` classes, as these are likely where the issue originates. From the provided search results, several relevant spans are identified across different files. In 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py', the `Artist.__getstate__` method is relevant as it handles the state for pickling. Similarly, in 'lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py', the `_AxesBase.__getstate__` method also handles state for pickling, which is likely relevant to the axes where legends are often added. Lastly, in 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py', the `Figure.__getstate__` method is relevant as it directly handles the state for pickling the figure. These spans should give us insights into how pickling is managed for these core components of the figure, which likely includes the draggable legend.",
