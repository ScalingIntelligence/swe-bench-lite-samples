This problem is related to pickling custom attributes and methods that are not handled by the default pickling process in matplotlib. The search results contain several files and spans of code related to pickling and figure objects in matplotlib.\n\nRelevant code spans are identified in the files `lib/matplotlib/cbook.py`, `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`, `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`, and `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`. These files contain `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods which are critical for the pickling process. The `CallbackRegistry` class in `cbook.py` is particularly relevant as it handles callbacks and may be used in the draggable legend functionality.\n\nIn `axes/_base.py`, the `_AxesBase` class has `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods which manage the state of axes objects. In `artist.py`, the `Artist` class also has a `__getstate__` method. The `Figure` class in `figure.py` includes `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods that handle the pickling of figure objects. The `FigureCanvasQT` class in `backend_qt.py` is also relevant as it deals with the backend for figures in a Qt context, but its relevance here is more indirect.\n\nThe identified spans are crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the pickling issue with draggable legends. They show how different components of the figure, such as axes and the figure itself, manage their states for pickling. This information will help in either fixing the existing implementation or developing a workaround.",

The '_pickled_cids' attribute and the accompanying '__getstate__' method illustrate a mechanism for controlling what can be pickled. This is particularly important as we are dealing with the pickling error related to a 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object. Additionally, the documentation around these functions suggests that not all callbacks may be picklable, which could explain the TypeError encountered. Hence, the focus should now shift to thoroughly examining this aspect of CallbackRegistry to understand how it impacts the pickling of figures, especially when they include draggable elements like legends.",

This suggests that the pickling process encounters issues with the draggable legend functionality. Starting from the provided file context, we identified sections related to pickling, including the __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods in classes like CallbackRegistry, _AxesBase, Artist, and Figure. These methods handle the serialization and deserialization of the respective objects. Diving into the new search results, we found more relevant sections in the Legend class, particularly the __init__ method where the draggable attribute is set through the set_draggable function. This function points to the DraggableLegend class in the offsetbox module, which handles the dragging functionality. The paintEvent method in the FigureCanvasQTAgg class is also relevant as it manages rendering in the context of the QtAgg backend, which might influence the pickling process. Overall, the identified code spans in the Legend class indicate a direct involvement in the reported issue, particularly around the draggable feature and its interplay with the pickling mechanism.",
