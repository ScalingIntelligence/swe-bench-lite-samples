The error message indicates a problem with pickling the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the figure or the legend is being handled in the Matplotlib library.\n\nGiven the search results, I analyzed two files: 'lib/matplotlib/artist.py' and 'lib/matplotlib/figure.py'. These files are relevant as they contain the 'Artist' and 'Figure' classes, which are central to Matplotlib's figure and axis management.\n\nIn 'artist.py', the 'Artist' class contains methods related to the artist objects in Matplotlib, including '__getstate__' which is relevant for pickling. However, the specific issue might not be directly addressed in this class as it deals more with general artist properties and management.\n\nIn 'figure.py', the 'Figure' class extends 'FigureBase' and manages figure properties and initializations. The '__getstate__' method in this class specifically handles state management for serialization (including pickling). Given the error message, it's plausible that the issue lies somewhere in the state management of the figure or its components during pickling.\n\nTherefore, the relevant code spans from these files would be the '__getstate__' methods in both 'Artist' and 'Figure' classes as they are directly related to pickling operations.",
