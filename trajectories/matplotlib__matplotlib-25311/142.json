The error message 'TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object' suggests that the canvas object associated with the figure is not picklable, which is common in GUI applications. Searching for the implementation of the draggable legend and the pickling methods in the figure class and related classes should provide insights into the issue. Specifically, we should look into the '__getstate__' method of the Figure class and the DraggableBase class to see how they handle pickling and if any adjustments are needed.",

The search results provided contain code spans related to the `Figure` class in Matplotlib, specifically focusing on methods like `__init__` and `__getstate__`. These methods are crucial for understanding the initialization and serialization (pickling) processes of a figure. The `__getstate__` method is particularly relevant as it defines what state is pickled. The code span 'Figure.__getstate__' explicitly excludes the 'canvas' attribute from the state being pickled. This exclusion aligns with the reported error, suggesting that the canvas object is the problematic part that cannot be pickled. Therefore, the identified code spans provide a direct lead to understanding and potentially solving the issue by handling the canvas attribute during pickling or identifying why the canvas object itself cannot be pickled.",
