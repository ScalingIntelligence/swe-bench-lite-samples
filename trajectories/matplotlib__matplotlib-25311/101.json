The provided context does not directly point to the exact location of the issue within the codebase. However, based on the error message and the context given, it's likely related to the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` handling in the backend or in the `Figure` class's pickling methods. I propose to start by reviewing the `Figure` class methods related to pickling and the base class (`FigureBase`), focusing particularly on the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods to ensure they handle the draggable legend settings appropriately. If the issue persists, a further inspection into the `Artist` class and the `FigureCanvasQT` in the backend_qt module might be needed.",
