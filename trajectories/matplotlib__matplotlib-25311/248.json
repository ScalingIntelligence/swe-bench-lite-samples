The error specifically mentions the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object, indicating that the pickling process is failing due to the canvas object being associated with the figure. The initial file context provided includes parts of the Figure class which manages the canvas and other figure properties. The search results primarily focus on the Figure class again, providing additional methods such as pick, draw, and the state management methods __getstate__ and __setstate__. These methods are relevant as they directly deal with the figure's canvas and its serialization, which aligns with the issue at hand. Given the nature of the error, it's likely that the canvas object is becoming part of the pickled state, which is not allowed by Python's pickle module for certain types of objects, such as GUI widgets like the FigureCanvasQTAgg. Therefore, reviewing and potentially modifying the __getstate__ method to exclude or handle the canvas object more appropriately seems to be the next logical step to address this issue. Additionally, methods like draw and pick, which involve the figure and its interaction with the canvas, might need adjustments. The search results provide a comprehensive look at these methods within the context of the Figure class, which is crucial for understanding and resolving the pickling issue.",
