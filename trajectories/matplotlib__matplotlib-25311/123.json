The error suggests that the pickling process fails due to the draggable legend feature. To address this, we need to examine the classes and methods involved in handling pickling for figures and legends. This includes looking at the 'Figure' class in 'matplotlib.figure' and related classes like 'Artist' in 'matplotlib.artist'. Additionally, since the error specifically mentions 'FigureCanvasQTAgg', it would be beneficial to look at the 'FigureCanvasQT' class in 'matplotlib.backends.backend_qt' and its associated methods.",

This issue results in a `TypeError` when attempting to pickle the figure, specifically mentioning that the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object cannot be pickled. The search results provided include relevant sections from the `matplotlib` library, focusing on the `Figure` class and its methods, especially `__getstate__`, which is responsible for defining what state should be pickled. This method in the `Figure` class specifically removes the 'canvas' attribute to avoid pickling errors. Additionally, other relevant classes like `Artist` and its methods such as `__getstate__` are included. These methods are crucial for understanding how state is managed and pickled in Matplotlib objects, specifically related to legends and figure annotations. Given that the specific error message mentions 'FigureCanvasQTAgg', it might also be relevant to look into the `FigureCanvasQT` class in the backend for any specific handling or declarations related to pickling or the canvas objects. The provided sections do not explicitly resolve the reported issue, but they do provide a starting point for understanding how Matplotlib handles pickling and specifically what is excluded during the pickling process.",
