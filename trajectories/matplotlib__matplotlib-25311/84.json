The `Figure` class in `matplotlib/figure.py` is central to the issue as it represents the figure being pickled. The `__getstate__` method in the `Figure` class is particularly relevant because it defines how the state of the figure is serialized for pickling. Additionally, the `Artist` class and its `__getstate__` method in `matplotlib/artist.py` might also be relevant as they are foundational classes in Matplotlib for graphical objects, including legends.
