The provided search results include two key files: 1) `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, which contains the definition and initialization of the `Figure` class, and the pickling-related method `__getstate__`. 2) `lib/matplotlib/legend.py`, which contains the `Legend` class definition and the method `set_draggable` that enables or disables the draggable feature of legends.\n\nThe issue at hand likely stems from the pickling process not being able to handle the state of the draggable legend. The `__getstate__` method in the `Figure` class is crucial, as it defines what state of the figure gets pickled. Notably, it explicitly omits the 'canvas' attribute, which is potentially related to the error message about the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object not being picklable. It's possible that the draggable legend introduces additional state that is not considered in the pickling process, leading to the error when pickling the figure.\n\nAdditionally, the `set_draggable` method in the `Legend` class is where the draggable feature is enabled. Since the draggable legend might create additional event listeners or change the way the legend interacts with the canvas, this could introduce complexities that interfere with the pickling process.\n\nGiven these observations, the key spans of the code to focus on are the `__getstate__` method in `Figure` and the `set_draggable` method in `Legend`. These are the areas where any necessary adjustments or additional state considerations for pickling would need to be made.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans for addressing the reported issue are 'Figure.__getstate__' in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` and 'Legend.set_draggable' in `lib/matplotlib/legend.py`.",

This suggests that the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object's pickling might be explicitly avoided to manage pickling errors.

Based on the existing context, the `Figure.__getstate__` method excludes the `canvas` from being pickled, which is a step in the right direction. However, the draggable legend functionality might be introducing additional elements that are not pickle-able. The new search results include code related to the DraggableBase class, which is likely used in the implementation of the draggable legend. This class's methods such as `__init__` and `on_pick` might have interactions with the canvas that are not being properly managed during pickling. Therefore, these parts of the code should be examined closely to determine if they can be adjusted to support pickling.

The error specifically points to the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object not being picklable. This suggests that the issue likely resides in how the canvas or the legend is being handled during the pickling process.\n\nFrom the existing file context, we already have relevant sections of the Figure class and the Legend class. Specifically, the Figure class includes the __getstate__ method, which is responsible for the state during pickling. The Legend class includes the set_draggable method, which is crucial for making the legend draggable.\n\nExamining the new search results, the additional code spans provided confirm our understanding of the relevant parts of the codebase. The new spans in 'Figure' include additional methods like 'pick', 'draw_without_rendering', and 'draw_artist', which are related to rendering and interacting with the figure. However, none of these new methods directly address the pickling issue.\n\nSimilarly, the new search results for 'DraggableBase' and its 'on_pick' method detail the interaction when picking the draggable object, but this does not directly impact the pickling process.\n\nGiven this analysis, the previously identified code spans in 'figure.py' (specifically the __getstate__ method of the Figure class) and 'legend.py' (the set_draggable method of the Legend class) are still the most relevant to the reported issue.
