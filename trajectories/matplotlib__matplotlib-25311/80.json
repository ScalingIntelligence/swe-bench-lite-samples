This issue likely involves understanding how the `Figure` class and its attributes are being pickled. The search results provide insights into the `Figure` class's initialization, properties, and methods, including relevant spans such as `Figure.__init__`, `Figure.__str__`, `Figure.__repr__`, `Figure.axes`, `Figure.pick`, and `Figure.figimage`, among others. These spans are crucial as they deal with the Figure's setup, interaction with axes, and image handling, which might have direct or indirect relations to the pickling issue. Notably, the span `Figure.__init__` includes detailed settings and configurations that could affect pickling, including the setup of callbacks and attributes like `dpi_scale_trans`, `bbox_inches`, and `subplotpars`. Furthermore, considering the canvas's role in rendering and interactivity, which isn't fully represented in the spans provided, additional investigation into canvas-related code (not found in the provided search results) could be necessary. However, with the current information, focusing on the `Figure` class and its related methods should be sufficient to start addressing the pickling issue. \n\nIn addition to the `Figure` class, the `Artist` class in `artist.py` might also play a role in handling some of the graphical elements that could potentially contribute to the pickling issue, especially considering that some of these elements might be interacting dynamically with the legend (draggable property). However, specific necessary spans from this file are not provided, therefore, focusing on the 'Figure' class might be sufficient here. Further investigation could require reviewing how attributes and methods from 'Artist' and possibly other classes that manage graphical elements interact with or influence the `Figure` class in ways relevant to pickling.",

Based on the existing context, the issue seems to be related to the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object not being picklable. The search results confirm this, showing the definition of `FigureCanvasQTAgg` in the `backend_qtagg.py` file. This class inherits from `FigureCanvasAgg` and `FigureCanvasQT`, indicating that it is the specific backend canvas used for rendering the figure in a Qt application. Given the error message and the search results, it is evident that the problem is centered around the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object's inability to be pickled. This is likely due to the complexity of the canvas object, which includes graphical and interactivity components that are not directly serializable using Python's pickle module.

The methods `paintEvent`, `print_figure`, and the class itself are identified as relevant code spans. Additionally, the `FigureCanvasQT` class in `backend_qt.py` and `FigureCanvasAgg` in `backend_agg.py` are also relevant as they handle figure rendering and pickling respectively.\n\nAfter examining the code spans, it is clear that the issue lies within the pickling process of a figure that contains a draggable object, likely due to the complexities involved in pickling GUI-related objects.
