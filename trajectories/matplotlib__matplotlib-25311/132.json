The error message `TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object` indicates that the pickling process is encountering difficulties due to the presence of the FigureCanvasQTAgg object, which is part of the interactive backends in Matplotlib. Since the issue is about pickling a figure, I'll focus on code spans related to the pickling process and the Figure class. In the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the '__getstate__' method of both the Artist and Figure classes in their respective files. These methods are crucial for the pickling process as they define what state of the object should be serialized. Looking at the Artist class, its '__getstate__' method seems to handle the serialization of its attributes and removes the 'stale_callback' to avoid issues during pickling. In the Figure class, the '__getstate__' method also prepares the state for serialization and removes the 'canvas' as it might be causing the issue. The additional context provided in the '__init__' methods of both classes also highlight interactions with different backends and attributes that might influence the pickling process.",
