The key elements to focus on are the Figure and Legend classes in `matplotlib`, as well as the `pickle` module's interaction with these classes. The search results include sections of the `Figure` class from `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, which is highly relevant as it deals with the creation and properties of figures, including their layout and rendering. Specifically, the `Figure.__getstate__` method is of particular interest as it handles the state of the figure for pickling. Additionally, the `Artist` class from `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` is relevant as it is a base class for many plotting objects in `matplotlib`, including Figure and Legend. The `Artist.__getstate__` method is also significant as it manages the state for pickling for all subclasses of Artist. These sections of code will help in understanding how the Figure and Artist objects are pickled and where the issue with the draggable legend might be occurring.",

The 'DraggableBase' class in 'offsetbox.py' manages the draggable functionality for artists, potentially including legends. During pickling, the state should exclude problematic attributes like 'canvas' in 'Figure', and ensure that callbacks and event handling mechanisms like those in 'DraggableBase' do not interfere with the pickling process.
