This issue appears to be related to the handling of figure managers and the state of the figures within the `Gcf` class. The search results include several relevant code spans in `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` and `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`. Specifically, the `Gcf` class spans provide the methods for managing figures and their states. The issue might be related to the interaction between the `rc_context` and the internal state of `Gcf`. Further, the `get_backend` function is defined in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`, but its implementation is straightforward and doesn't modify the state of `Gcf.figs`. However, the issue might be triggered by some side effect of this function call. Additional investigation may be needed to determine the exact cause, but the provided code spans are highly relevant to understanding the issue and potential fixes.",

Additionally, the `matplotlib.__init__.py` file is provided, which contains the `get_backend()` function itself and the context manager `rc_context`. This context manager handles the scope where resources are allocated and ensures their cleanup, which is directly related to handling the context in which figures are created.
