The provided search results and file context contain several relevant pieces of information, including the definition of the `Gcf` class, various methods within `Gcf` that deal with figure managers, and the `get_backend` function in the `__init__.py` file, which simply returns the backend set in the `rcParams`. Given this, the following steps were taken to identify the relevant code spans:\n\n1. Reviewed the `Gcf` class and its methods in `_pylab_helpers.py` to understand how figures are managed and destroyed.\n2. Reviewed the `get_backend` function in `__init__.py` to understand how the backend is retrieved, which is potentially triggering the clearing of figures.\n3. Confirmed that the `rc_context` function in `__init__.py` affects the `rcParams`, and the context manager potentially alters the state in a way that causes figures to be cleared.\n4. Ensured that the spans related to `Gcf`, `get_backend`, and `rc_context` were included to cover the relevant parts of the codebase.\n\nAfter analyzing these components, the decision was made to include spans related to `Gcf`, `get_backend`, and `rc_context` as they are directly involved in the reported issue. All relevant spans have been identified, and further search is not necessary as they directly address the reported issue.",
