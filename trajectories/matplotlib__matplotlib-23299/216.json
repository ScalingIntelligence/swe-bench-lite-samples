The issue specifically mentions that calling `get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the first figure was created in an `rc_context`. This suggests that there is an interaction between the `rc_context` and the `get_backend()` function that is not handled correctly. To address this, it's crucial to understand how `rc_context` modifies the state and how `get_backend()` interacts with this state. The search results provide several key sections of code that are relevant to this issue. The `rc_context` function in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` shows how the context manager updates the `rcParams` and restores them upon exit. The `get_backend` function also in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` simply returns the current backend from `rcParams`. In `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`, the `figure` function is relevant as it is involved in creating new figures, which might be affected by the `rc_context`. These code spans provide a good starting point to investigate the issue, particularly focusing on the interaction between the `rc_context` and the state of `Gcf.figs`. However, more detailed inspection of these functions and their interactions would be necessary to fully understand and resolve the issue. There might also be additional interactions or modifications elsewhere in the codebase that affect the state of figures, which may need further investigation.",

Specifically, it is observed that calling `get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure was created within an `rc_context`. This behavior is unexpected and leads to the figure being missing from `Gcf.figs`, causing issues such as `plt.close(fig)` not working. The analysis of the provided search results and the current context indicates that the key areas of interest are the `Gcf` class methods in `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` and the `get_backend` function in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`. Particularly, the methods `Gcf.get_fig_manager`, `Gcf.set_active`, `Gcf.destroy`, and `Gcf.destroy_fig` from the `Gcf` class seem relevant as they deal with managing and destroying figures. Furthermore, the presence of `Gcf.figs` in the `Gcf` class suggests a direct interaction with figure management in Matplotlib. Additionally, since the issue involves `rc_context`, it is crucial to have a complete understanding of how context management affects figure creation and environment settings that could potentially influence the behavior observed.",

Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
