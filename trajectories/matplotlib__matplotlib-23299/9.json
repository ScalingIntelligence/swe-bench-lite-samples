The key elements to look for in the code are the `get_backend` function and the `rc_context` context manager, as well as the management of figures in `Gcf`. The provided search results include the relevant parts of the codebase: `matplotlib/__init__.py` contains the definition of `get_backend` and `rc_context`, and `matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` contains the `Gcf` class that manages figures. These sections of code are directly related to the issue described, indicating a potential point of impact for the bug. The `get_backend` function retrieves the backend from `rcParams`, and the `rc_context` context manager modifies `rcParams` temporarily. The `Gcf` class maintains a dictionary of figures (`figs`), and methods for managing them, such as `set_active`, `destroy`, and `destroy_all`. This structure suggests that the issue might arise from interactions between the `rc_context` modifying `rcParams` and the `Gcf` class relying on the state of `rcParams` during figure management. The code spans identified provide a clear starting point for further investigation into the bug's cause.",

In the provided file context, we have the definition of `get_backend()` in `__init__.py` which simply returns the current backend from `rcParams`. Additionally, the `Gcf` class is defined in `_pylab_helpers.py`, which manages the figures. The issue suggests that `get_backend()` clears all figures from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure was created in an `rc_context`. This implies that the problem likely lies in the interaction between `rc_context` and `Gcf`, or possibly within the backend code that `get_backend()` interacts with. However, the exact cause of the figures being cleared is not immediately clear from the provided context alone. Further investigation into the backend implementation and how it interacts with `Gcf` during `get_backend()` calls would be necessary to fully understand and resolve the issue.

This behavior is unexpected and leads to issues such as `plt.close(fig2)` not functioning correctly because the figure cannot be found in `Gcf.figs`. The key elements to focus on are the `get_backend()` function itself, the `rc_context` function, and the `Gcf` class's handling of figures. Additionally, the `FigureManagerQT` class from `backend_qt.py` is relevant as it interacts with `Gcf` during the creation and destruction of figures. The provided search results include the `get_backend()`, `rc_context()`, and parts of the `Gcf` class from `_pylab_helpers.py`, along with the `FigureManagerQT` class from `backend_qt.py`, which manage the QT backend's interaction with `Gcf`.

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: get_backend() clears figures from Gcf.figs if they were created under rc_context\n### Bug summary\r\n\r\ncalling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the *first* figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`.\r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nfrom matplotlib import get_backend, rc_context\r\n\r\n# fig1 = plt.figure()  # <- UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL WORK\r\n# plt.ion()            # <- ALTERNATIVELY, UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL ALSO WORK\r\nwith rc_context():\r\n    fig2 = plt.figure()\r\nbefore = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'\r\nget_backend()\r\nafter = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'\r\n\r\nassert before == after, '\\n' + before + '\\n' + after\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-1-fa4d099aa289> in <cell line: 11>()\r\n      9 after = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'\r\n     10 \r\n---> 11 assert before == after, '\\n' + before + '\\n' + after\r\n     12 \r\n\r\nAssertionError: \r\n94453354309744 OrderedDict([(1, <matplotlib.backends.backend_qt.FigureManagerQT object at 0x7fb33e26c220>)])\r\n94453354309744 OrderedDict()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nThe figure should not be missing from `Gcf`.  Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
