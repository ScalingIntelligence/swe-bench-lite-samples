To address this issue, I need to examine how `rc_context` influences the state of `Gcf` and how `get_backend()` interacts with this state. From the provided context and search results, I focus on the `rc_context` function and the methods of the `Gcf` class, particularly `destroy_fig` and `set_active`. I also pay attention to how `rcParams` are managed, as they might influence the backend and figure state. From the context, `rc_context` updates `rcParams` within a context and restores the original values afterward, whereas `Gcf` manages figures and their states. In the search results, I find additional methods of `Gcf` like `destroy`, `destroy_all`, and `set_active`, which could influence figure management and might interact with the `rc_context`. Based on the issue description, focusing on how figures are added, accessed, and removed from `Gcf` within and outside `rc_context` is crucial. Understanding these interactions will help determine why figures might be lost when calling `get_backend()`, especially after being created in an `rc_context`.",
