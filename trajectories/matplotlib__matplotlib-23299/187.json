This suggests that the interaction between `rc_context` and the backend management in `Gcf` is faulty. The `Gcf` class manages the figures and their managers in an `OrderedDict`. The relevant code spans identified are mainly from `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` which holds the `Gcf` class. This class includes methods to manage figures, including getting, destroying, and setting active figures. The spans include `Gcf.destroy`, `Gcf.destroy_fig`, and `Gcf.set_active`, which are crucial for understanding how figures are managed and potentially how they might be erroneously cleared. Additionally, the `get_backend` function from `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` directly influences the observed behavior as it retrieves the backend setting from `rcParams`, which could be altered by the `rc_context`, leading to the bug. Thus, these code spans provide a comprehensive view of the functionality related to figure management and backend retrieval in relation to the bug report.",

The `get_backend()` function defined in `matplotlib/__init__.py` also appears to be directly related to the issue, as it is the function called that triggers the problematic behavior. However, no specific code that interacts with `rc_context` is present in the provided context. This might be crucial, as the issue arises when figures are created within an `rc_context`.
