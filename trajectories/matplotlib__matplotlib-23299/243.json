            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves the `matplotlib.get_backend()` function clearing figures from `Gcf.figs` when they were created within an `rc_context`. The problem seems to be specifically when the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`. To address this, we need to investigate the `get_backend()` function and its interactions with `Gcf` within the `rc_context`. We should also look into how figures are managed within `Gcf` to understand why they are being cleared unexpectedly. Given the context provided, it's crucial to inspect the `get_backend()` function and its related methods in the `__init__.py` file, as well as the `Gcf` class in the `_pylab_helpers.py` file.",

To identify relevant code spans, I focused on functions and classes that interact with `Gcf` and `rc_context`. In `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`, the `Gcf` class is responsible for managing figures, and its methods like `destroy`, `destroy_all`, and `set_active` are crucial for understanding figure management. Additionally, in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`, the `get_backend` function directly interacts with `rcParams`, which could be related to the issue. Analyzing the entire sections, especially around figure creation and backend retrieval, is essential to understand how `rc_context` might affect figure persistence. The code spans identified are relevant as they deal directly with the management and retrieval of figures, which is central to the reported issue.",

The new search results confirm and expand on this, providing additional methods within the `Gcf` class that are relevant to figure management and destruction. Notably, both `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` and `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` contain relevant code spans that show how backends and contexts are managed and how figures are handled within `Gcf`.

The `get_backend()` function simply returns the backend configured in `rcParams`, suggesting that it does not directly alter the state of `Gcf.figs`, but rather the configuration context could be indirectly affecting it. Furthermore, the `destroy` and `destroy_all` methods in `Gcf` could be implicated if erroneous conditions occur because of state changes made during or after the `rc_context` is active. This could explain why figures created within the `rc_context` are being cleared from `Gcf.figs` upon some interaction post-context activation. Given that we have not found new relevant search results, we might be looking in the right direction but needing further context or additional code inspections to entirely pinpoint the root cause.
