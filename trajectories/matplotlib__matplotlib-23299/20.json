The issue states that if the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`, calling `get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf`. This suggests that the problem is likely related to how `Gcf` manages figures and how the backend is accessed or modified within an `rc_context`. To address this, the relevant code spans need to be examined, particularly those related to the `Gcf` class and the `get_backend` function. The identified code spans show the implementation of `Gcf` and its methods for managing figures (e.g., `get_fig_manager`, `destroy`, `destroy_fig`, `destroy_all`, `set_active`, and `draw_all`). Additionally, the `get_backend` function is found in the `__init__.py` file, which retrieves the backend from `rcParams`. This information is crucial as it allows us to analyze whether the context management of `rc_context` and the retrieval of the backend in `get_backend` might inadvertently affect the figure management in `Gcf`. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that involve the management of figures in `Gcf` and the access to the backend configuration. These spans should be evaluated to ensure they correctly handle the context of figures created under an `rc_context`.",
