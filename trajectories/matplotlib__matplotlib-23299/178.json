The `Gcf` class is responsible for managing figures and their associated managers. By examining the `Gcf` class, it's clear that it maintains an `OrderedDict` of figures and has methods to manage (e.g., create, destroy, get) these figures. The issue's focus on the first figure created under an `rc_context` implies that the context manager might be altering the behavior of figure creation or management in a way that `get_backend()` cannot handle appropriately, potentially leading to the clearing of figures from `Gcf.figs`. Additionally, the `get_backend()` function in the `matplotlib.__init__` module simply returns the current backend from the rcParams, indicating that the root cause of the issue is likely within the `Gcf` class or the interaction between the `Gcf` class and the context under which figures are created. To resolve the issue, further analysis is needed to understand why the figures are being cleared and if there are specific checks or handling that need to be added to prevent this behavior when using the `rc_context`.",

This points to a potential interaction or state manipulation issue when `get_backend` is called under such a context. To debug this effectively, direct examination of the `rc_context` implementation and how it handles or changes states related to figure management (specifically `Gcf.figs`) is imperative.

This behavior is not expected and the figures should persist. The current analysis shows that the problematic function `get_backend()` currently only retrieves the backend from `rcParams` without any additional side effects. However, the issue's reproduction code suggests that the removal of figures correlates with the `rc_context` change, indicating a potential unsync between the global state and the context state. The `rc_context` function alters the `rcParams` and then restores them, but there seems to be an issue with how these changes are managed or reverted after the context block. This could be related to how `rcParams` are handled in the `rc_context` function or within `Gcf` when interacting with the figures. Thus, the relevance of this information paves the way for identifying the root cause and proposing the necessary corrections to ensure that figures persist after context changes and sequential operations like `get_backend()`. Additionally, other relevant functions such as `set_active`, `destroy`, `destroy_all`, and others within `Gcf` should be investigated further for potential edge cases related to figure management and context handling.",

Additionally, the `__init__.py` file includes the implementation of `get_backend`, which interacts with `rcParams` to return the current backend without any direct manipulation of figure states. Given these pieces, the file context seems relevant to the issue as it provides the underlying structure needed to address how and where figure management states might be altered or influenced when `get_backend` is invoked under an `rc_context`. This context could be used to pinpoint further exactly what steps or checks need to be added or adjusted within these methods to ensure state consistency under varying creation contexts for figures.",
