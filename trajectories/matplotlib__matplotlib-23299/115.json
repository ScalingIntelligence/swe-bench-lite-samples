Upon calling `get_backend()`, all figures are cleared from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure was created within an `rc_context`. To address this, I'll analyze the `Gcf` class in `_pylab_helpers.py` and the `get_backend()` function in `__init__.py` to identify code spans related to figure management and backend retrieval.\n\n1. **Gcf Class Analysis**: The `Gcf` class manages figures using an `OrderedDict` named `figs`. Methods like `destroy`, `destroy_fig`, `destroy_all`, `set_active`, and `draw_all` manipulate this dictionary. These methods are crucial for understanding how figure management might interact with the backend retrieval.\n2. **get_backend() Function**: The `get_backend()` function simply returns the current backend from `rcParams`. No direct interaction with `Gcf.figs` is observed here, suggesting the issue might be related to how the backend retrieval affects the `rc_context`.\n3. **Context Awareness**: Given the issue occurs within an `rc_context`, it's important to ensure the context management doesn't inadvertently affect figure management, especially when the backend is queried.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans include those where figure management and backend retrieval occur, particularly within the `Gcf` class and the `get_backend()` function.",

Looking at the provided context, `get_backend()` simply returns the current backend from `rcParams`. The key question is how `rc_context` modifies the state and whether this modification impacts the figures in `Gcf`. We should also consider the possible side effects and state changes occurring within the `rc_context`, especially focusing on any changes to the figure management or backend setup that might lead to figures being cleared. Further examination of the call stack and state management during the execution of `get_backend()` within an `rc_context` is necessary to determine why figures are being cleared.",

Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
