The key problem is that calling `get_backend()` clears all figures from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure was created in an `rc_context`. The issue is focused on the `Gcf` class and its interaction with figures, particularly in the context management. The provided search results contain relevant code spans from `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`, which includes the `Gcf` class definition and methods like `destroy`, `destroy_fig`, and `destroy_all`, which are central to managing figures and their lifecycles. Additionally, the `get_backend` function from `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` is identified as the function implicated in the issue, indicating that it interacts with the figures' management system. These findings suggest that the problem might lie in how `get_backend` interacts with or affects the `figs` dictionary in the `Gcf` class. Therefore, the relevant code spans including the entire `Gcf` class and the `get_backend` function are identified as relevant to the reported issue.",

Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
