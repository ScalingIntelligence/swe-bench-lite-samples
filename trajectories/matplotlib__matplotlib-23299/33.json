This issue is critical as it affects the ability to manage and close figures properly. The relevant components identified from the issue include `Gcf`, `get_backend()`, `rc_context()`, and the management of figures within `Gcf.figs`. The search results provide a comprehensive set of methods and class attributes within `Gcf`, specifically focusing on figure management. Additionally, the results include the definition of `get_backend()` and `rc_context()` functions, confirming their presence and interaction with the `rcParams` which could influence the figure management in `Gcf`. Given these findings, the search results offer a direct correlation to the elements mentioned in the issue, suggesting that the key to resolving the bug lies within the detailed operations within `Gcf` and the interaction between `get_backend()` and the context management in `rc_context()`.",

The search results provided are consistent with the file context already identified, specifically focusing on the `Gcf` class and its related methods from `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`. The identified spans from the new search results include all key methods related to managing figures within `Gcf`, such as `set_active`, `destroy`, `get_fig_manager`, and others, confirming they align with the issue description. The `get_backend()` function found in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` is also pivotal since it triggers the issue when figures are managed by `Gcf`, suggesting its interaction with `Gcf` under `rc_context` conditions must be examined. The relevance of these spans to the reported issue is high as they directly concern figure management under different contexts, backing the need for further investigations into how context (like `rc_context`) could potentially alter the behavior of figure management utilities. Based on the current context and search results, the task of identifying the relevant code spans seems complete, as all targeted functionalities involved in the reported issue have been accounted for in the analyzed code.",

This context does not directly clear figures, but its interaction with `rcParams` and subsequent effects on `Gcf.figs` need further exploration. The `get_backend` function also does not directly manipulate figures, indicating that the issue might lie in how `rc_context` impacts `Gcf` when figures are created within it.

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: get_backend() clears figures from Gcf.figs if they were created under rc_context\n### Bug summary\r\n\r\ncalling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the *first* figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`.\r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nfrom matplotlib import get_backend, rc_context\r\n\r\n# fig1 = plt.figure()  # <- UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL WORK\r\n# plt.ion()            # <- ALTERNATIVELY, UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL ALSO WORK\r\nwith rc_context():\r\n    fig2 = plt.figure()\r\nbefore = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'\r\nget_backend()\r\nafter = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'\r\n\r\nassert before == after, '\\n' + before + '\\n' + after\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-1-fa4d099aa289> in <cell line: 11>()\r\n      9 after = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'\r\n     10 \r\n---> 11 assert before == after, '\\n' + before + '\\n' + after\r\n     12 \r\n\r\nAssertionError: \r\n94453354309744 OrderedDict([(1, <matplotlib.backends.backend_qt.FigureManagerQT object at 0x7fb33e26c220>)])\r\n94453354309744 OrderedDict()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nThe figure should not be missing from `Gcf`.  Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
