The key problem is that calling `get_backend()` clears all figures from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure was created in an `rc_context`. This is evidenced by the code example provided, where the assertion fails after calling `get_backend()`. To address this issue, it's necessary to examine the implementation of both `get_backend()` and the `Gcf` class in the `matplotlib._pylab_helpers` module. The relevant code spans to focus on are those related to `get_backend()`, the `figs` attribute of the `Gcf` class, and methods such as `destroy_fig()` which are crucial for managing figure lifetimes and references. However, the search results did not directly include the code for `rc_context`, which could also be critical to understand how context affects figure creation and management. The search might be incomplete without this context. Nevertheless, based on the provided results, the identified spans cover the core functionality related to the reported issue.",

It's apparent from the code snippets provided that `get_backend()` simply returns the current backend as defined in `rcParams` without interacting with `Gcf` at all. The issue might lie in the way `rc_context` modifies global states or figure references when figures are created inside it. Since the direct interaction point, `get_backend()`, doesn't confer the issue, further investigation should narrow down on how `rc_context` affects the state of figures and their references in `Gcf`.

To address this, it's crucial to identify the relevant sections of code related to `get_backend` and `rc_context` to understand how the context affects `Gcf.figs`. The provided search results include code spans for `get_backend`, `rc_context`, and related functions.
