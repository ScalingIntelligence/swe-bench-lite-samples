To circumvent the limitations of my current search parameters, a shift in focus towards understanding the broader lifecycle and state management of figures within the `matplotlib` ecosystem is advisable.

Understanding how `rc_context` modifies the state is crucial for addressing the bug, especially considering how it interacts with `Gcf` and figure management.

However, the `Gcf` class manages figure handling globally across `matplotlib`, which indirectly suggests that the issue might be related to the interaction between the `rc_context` temporarily altering `rcParams` and `get_backend()` accessing them without considering the limited context. This interaction is not explicitly handled or managed in the provided file context, hinting at a potential broader interaction within the `matplotlib` library or its dependencies.",
            "search_suggestions": "Look for additional context or cross-references in other parts of the `matplotlib` codebase where `rcParams` management and figure handling might intersect, especially where modifications to `rcParams` might unintentionally affect the state of figure managers in `Gcf`."

Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
