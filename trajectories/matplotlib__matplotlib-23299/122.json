Given the context, the focus should be on understanding the interactions between `get_backend()`, `rc_context()`, and `Gcf` in the matplotlib library. Specifically, the `_pylab_helpers.Gcf` class and its methods `get_active`, `set_active`, and `draw_all` are likely involved in managing figure instances. Additionally, the `get_backend` function and its impact on figure management within the rc_context should be reviewed. Searching for references to these items will be crucial to identify where the figure management logic might be going wrong.",

Specifically, the spans 'Gcf', 'Gcf.destroy', 'Gcf.destroy_fig', and 'Gcf.destroy_all' are directly related to managing and destroying figures, which could be where the issue arises. Additionally, the 'Gcf.destroy' and 'Gcf.destroy_all' methods might be responsible for removing figures from `Gcf.figs`, potentially leading to the observed behavior in the reported issue. The spans related to `rc_context` and `get_backend` in `__init__.py` and `pyplot.py` are also relevant as they provide context on how the `rc_context` and `get_backend` functions operate.

Additionally, the `__init__.py` file contains the `get_backend` function, which is central to the reported issue as calling this function leads to the figures being cleared. The `rc_context` function, also in `__init__.py`, is used to handle context-specific configurations, which aligns with the issue's description of figures being affected under an `rc_context`.

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: get_backend() clears figures from Gcf.figs if they were created under rc_context\n### Bug summary\r\n\r\ncalling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the *first* figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`.\r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nfrom matplotlib import get_backend, rc_context\r\n\r\n# fig1 = plt.figure()  # <- UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL WORK\r\n# plt.ion()            # <- ALTERNATIVELY, UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL ALSO WORK\r\nwith rc_context():\r\n    fig2 = plt.figure()\r\nbefore = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'\r\nget_backend()\r\nafter = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'\r\n\r\nassert before == after, '\\n' + before + '\\n' + after\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\n```\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-1-fa4d099aa289> in <cell line: 11>()\r\n      9 after = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'\r\n     10 \r\n---> 11 assert before == after, '\\n' + before + '\\n' + after\r\n     12 \r\n\r\nAssertionError: \r\n94453354309744 OrderedDict([(1, <matplotlib.backends.backend_qt.FigureManagerQT object at 0x7fb33e26c220>)])\r\n94453354309744 OrderedDict()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nThe figure should not be missing from `Gcf`.  Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
