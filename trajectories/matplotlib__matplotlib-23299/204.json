In `__init__.py`, the `rc_context` function is defined as a context manager that updates `rcParams` temporarily and resets them after the context is exited. The function `get_backend` simply returns the current backend from `rcParams`. Given these details, the next step is to investigate methods in `pyplot.py` or any other relevant backend management files that might interact with `Gcf` or `rc_context` during backend retrieval or context switching, especially focusing on areas where `get_backend()` might have unintended side effects on figure management.",

Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
