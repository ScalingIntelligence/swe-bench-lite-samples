This problem is particularly concerning because it affects figure management, which is crucial for GUI applications and interactive plotting. The issue can be traced to the interaction between `get_backend()`, `rc_context`, and figure creation/management functions. Therefore, the search should focus on `matplotlib/__init__.py` for `get_backend()`, and possibly `pyplot.py` for any related figure creation functions. Additionally, `_pylab_helpers.py` should be inspected for any logic that might be incorrectly handling figure references due to the `rc_context` usage.",

This issue involves interactions between the `get_backend` function, the `rc_context` context manager, and the `Gcf` class. The provided search results include several relevant code spans: 1. The `get_backend` function definition in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`. 2. The `figure` function in `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`, which is responsible for creating new figures. 3. The `Gcf` class and its methods in `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`, particularly `Gcf.destroy_fig` which is used to destroy figures. These code spans collectively cover the functionalities necessary to understand and potentially address the issue, including figure management and the retrieval of the backend. By considering these code spans together, we can evaluate the interaction between the context in which figures are created and their persistence in the `Gcf` class.",

Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
