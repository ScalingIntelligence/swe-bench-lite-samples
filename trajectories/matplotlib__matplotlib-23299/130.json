This affects the figure management system and could disrupt expected behaviors like closing a figure. To address this, we need to investigate the interaction between `rc_context`, `get_backend()`, and the `Gcf` class. Specifically, focusing on how `rc_context` modifies the environment and how `get_backend()` interacts with the current configuration might reveal the root cause. Furthermore, looking into the methods related to figure management in the `Gcf` class might provide insights into how figures are stored and retrieved.",

From the provided search results, the function `get_backend()` in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` is directly related to the issue as it retrieves the backend configuration. Additionally, the `rc_context()` function is also important as it manages the resource configurations within a context. Both of these functions are contained within the same file, making it clear that the relevant code spans are within `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`. By examining these spans, I can identify the specific portions of the code that might be causing the figure clearing issue.
