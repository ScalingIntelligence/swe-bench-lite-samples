This behavior is unintended and has significant consequences, such as `plt.close(fig2)` not working because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find the figure. The search results include important context on how `rc_context` and `get_backend()` are implemented in the codebase. Notably, the `rc_context` function uses a context manager to temporarily alter `rcParams` and restore the original state afterward. The `get_backend()` function simply returns the current backend from `rcParams`. Given the issue's focus on the interaction between `rc_context` and `get_backend()`, both the `rc_context` and `get_backend()` spans from the `__init__.py` file are identified as relevant. Additionally, the `rc_file` function, which is part of the context management in `rc_context`, is also identified for a complete understanding. While `get_backend()` itself is straightforward and does not directly manipulate figures, the bug suggests an unintended interaction during context management, making the identified spans crucial for addressing the issue.",

Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
