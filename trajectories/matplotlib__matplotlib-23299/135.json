This behavior is unexpected, as figures should persist through such contexts. To address this, we need to investigate the `get_backend()` function and the `rc_context` context manager within Matplotlib's codebase. Additionally, we should look into the `Gcf` class methods, particularly `set_active` and `destroy_fig`, as they manage figure lifecycle and might be involved in the issue.

This suggests that the interaction between `get_backend()` and the management of figures in `Gcf` is problematic. By examining the provided search results, I can see that the `Gcf` class in `matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` is responsible for managing figures. Specifically, the `figs` attribute of `Gcf` is an `OrderedDict` that holds the figures. The methods `destroy`, `destroy_fig`, and `destroy_all` are responsible for removing figures, which could be related to the issue. Given the issue description, the focus should be on understanding how `get_backend()` (found in `matplotlib/__init__.py`) interacts with `Gcf`. However, the provided code spans do not directly show the interaction between these two functionalities. Still, the fragments involving `Gcf` suggest areas that might need to be investigated further to diagnose and fix the reported issue.",

Specifically, calling `get_backend()` causes figures created under an `rc_context` to be removed from `Gcf.figs`. From the initial search results and the provided context, we have identified several key parts of the codebase that might be relevant to this issue:\n\n1. `Gcf` class in `_pylab_helpers.py` containing `figs`, `destroy`, `destroy_fig`, and `destroy_all` methods.\n2. `get_backend` function in `__init__.py` which retrieves the backend from `rcParams`.\n3. `rc_context` function in `pyplot.py` which is used to manage the `rcParams` context.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context and functions related to `rc` and `rc_context` in both `pyplot.py` and `__init__.py`:\n\n- The `rc` and `rc_context` functions in `pyplot.py` are simple wrappers around the respective functions in the `matplotlib` module, indicating that they delegate their functionality to the core module.\n- In `__init__.py`, the `rc` and `rc_context` functions are more involved, managing the `rcParams` and providing context for these settings. The `rc_context` function uses a context manager to temporarily update `rcParams` and then restore the original settings after the context block.\n\nGiven these findings, it seems likely that the issue could be related to how `rc_context` affects the global `rcParams` and subsequently the behavior of `get_backend()`. The relevant code spans identifying this behavior include the implementations of `rc_context` in both `pyplot.py` and `__init__.py`.",

Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
