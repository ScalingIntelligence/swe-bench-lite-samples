The search results include several spans of code, but the most relevant ones are those directly related to the `rc_context` and `get_backend` functions. These are found in the `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` and `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` files. Specifically, the spans tagged with 'rc_context' and 'get_backend' are directly involved in the operation mentioned in the issue. These spans are critical as they show how `rc_context` applies a temporary configuration, and how `get_backend` retrieves the current backend, but apparently, interacts with the figures in `Gcf.figs` in an undesired manner when an `rc_context` is active. Therefore, these code spans are directly affected by the reported issue and are likely the focus for further debugging or modification to fix the issue.",

Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nXubuntu\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.5.2\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\nPython 3.10.4\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"
