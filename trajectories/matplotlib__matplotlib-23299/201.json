The primary concern is that calling `get_backend()` causes all figures to be removed from `Gcf` if the first figure was created within an `rc_context`. This behavior can be traced to how `rc_context` interacts with figure creation and management in `matplotlib`. To resolve this, we need to identify where and how `rc_context` affects the figure management, especially interactions with `Gcf.figs`. Hence, the focus should be on the `rc_context` management and any operations related to `Gcf` within the `matplotlib` package.",

The key elements to focus on are `get_backend()`, `Gcf.figs`, and `rc_context`. The search results provide several relevant code spans: \n\n1. In `_pylab_helpers.py`, we have the class `Gcf` which manages figures, including methods to get, destroy, and set active figures. This is directly related to the `Gcf.figs` mentioned in the issue.\n\n2. In `__init__.py`, there are spans for `rc_context` and `get_backend()`. The `rc_context` span shows the context manager implementation that might affect the state of figures when entered. The `get_backend()` span hints at where the backend retrieval might interact with the figure state, but it's not directly present in the provided spans.\n\n3. In `testing/conftest.py`, the `mpl_test_settings` fixture interacts with `get_backend()` and backend switching, which could indirectly influence the state of `Gcf.figs`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the relevant files and code spans are those that deal directly with the management of figures (`Gcf`) and the settings context (`rc_context`), including any interactions that might affect these.\n\n\n\n",
