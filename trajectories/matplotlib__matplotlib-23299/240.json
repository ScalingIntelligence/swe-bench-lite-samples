To address this, we need to review the code related to `Gcf` and `get_backend()`. The `Gcf` class in `matplotlib._pylab_helpers.py` manages the collection of figure managers and includes methods to manipulate them. Specifically, `Gcf.destroy`, `Gcf.destroy_fig`, and `Gcf.destroy_all` are relevant as they handle the destruction of figure managers. Also, the `get_backend()` function in `matplotlib.__init__.py` should be checked to see if it interacts with `Gcf.figs`.

Particularly relevant are the methods like `Gcf.destroy`, `Gcf.destroy_fig`, `Gcf.set_active`, and `Gcf.draw_all` that handle the lifecycle of figures. These methods directly deal with the figures stored in `Gcf.figs` and how they are managed.\n\n2. **lib/matplotlib/__init__.py**: This file includes the implementation of `get_backend()` which returns the current backend. It also provides the `rc` and `rc_context` functions that modify the global `rcParams` settings that might affect how figures are created and managed when using `get_backend()`.\n\nAfter reviewing the new search results, I can deduce that parts of the code that manage the lifecycle of figures (like creation and destruction in `Gcf` class methods) and the functions that handle the plotting settings (`rc` and `rc_context` in `__init__.py`) are directly relevant to address the reported issue. This suggests that the issue lies somewhere in the interaction between these functionalities, potentially due to context changes not being properly handled when calling `get_backend()`.",
