The problem specifically occurs when figures are created within an `rc_context`. The `rc_context` is a context manager that allows for temporary changes to the Matplotlib runtime configuration. The main concern is that calling `get_backend()` clears all figures from `Gcf.figs` if they were created inside an `rc_context`. Identifying the exact place where `get_backend()` interacts with `Gcf.figs` and how `rc_context` influences this interaction is crucial for fixing this bug.",
