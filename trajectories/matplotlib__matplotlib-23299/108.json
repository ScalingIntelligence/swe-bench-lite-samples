To address this, it's essential to analyze the `Gcf` class in `matplotlib._pylab_helpers.py` since it manages the figures. The relevant code spans include the entire class definition of `Gcf`, which handles the management of figures, including creation, destruction, and identification. Additionally, the `get_backend` function in `matplotlib/__init__.py` interacts with `rcParams` to determine the backend, so it's relevant to investigate how `get_backend` interacts with the state of `Gcf`. The `rc_context` function is also crucial as it sets a context for modifying `rcParams`, potentially leading to the bug if used incorrectly. The code spans for `rc_context` and `get_backend` are examined to understand their interactions and potential impact on the state of `Gcf`. Overall, these code sections provide a comprehensive view of the figure management and backend configuration in matplotlib, making them relevant to the reported issue.",

With the new search results, it's evident that the spans focusing on `Gcf` class methods and the `rc_context` provide a comprehensive overview of how figure management and resource contexts are handled in the codebase. The identified spans demonstrate how figures are activated, destroyed, and accessed, providing the necessary context to understand the issue and possibly implement a fix or enhancement. Furthermore, the `rc_context` management is clearly defined in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`, establishing the context boundaries for the runtime configuration changes.

The primary concern is that calling `get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`. The expected behavior is that the figure should remain in `Gcf`, and it should not be missing. This has consequences, such as `plt.close(fig2)` not working because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` cannot find the figure.\n\nThe primary file we are interested in is `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`, as it contains the `Gcf` class, which manages the figures. The relevant spans from this file are already provided in the context. We also need to look at `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` and `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` for functions like `get_backend()` and `rc_context()`.\n\nFrom the search results, we can see that the search results contain the same relevant code spans as in the file context for `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` and `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`.
