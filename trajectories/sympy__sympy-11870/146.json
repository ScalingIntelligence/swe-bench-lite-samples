To address these needs, the relevant code spans should include the `trigsimp` function and related trigonometric simplification methods, as well as the definition of the `sinc` function. The search results provide multiple relevant code spans:\n\n1. The `trigsimp` function itself, which is responsible for simplifying trigonometric expressions, is found in the `trigsimp` span.\n\n2. The `exptrigsimp` function, which simplifies expressions involving both exponentials and trigonometric functions, could also be relevant, especially given the use of exponentials in the input expressions. This is found in the `exptrigsimp` span.\n\n3. The definition of the `sinc` function, which is the target for one of the simplifications.
