The new search results include the `exptrigsimp` function from the same `trigsimp` module. This function could be relevant as it simplifies expressions involving both exponentials and trigonometric functions. However, based on the provided context, the functionality for directly handling these specific exponential to trig simplifications seems to be part of the `trigsimp` function, and there's no specific evidence in the provided spans to suggest that the directly relevant functionality is within the `exptrigsimp` section. Therefore, the new search results do not seem directly relevant based on the provided spans, and it's likely that if functionality to directly handle that type of simplification exists, it is part of the broader `trigsimp` function spread across the originally provided spans.",
