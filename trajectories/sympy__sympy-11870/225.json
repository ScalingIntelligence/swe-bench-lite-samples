Meanwhile, in 'sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py', the 'trigsimp' function is defined to simplify trigonometric expressions, utilizing various methods such as 'fu', 'matching', 'groebner', and 'combined'. There's also an 'exptrigsimp' function that specializes in simplifying expressions containing both exponential and trigonometric functions.
