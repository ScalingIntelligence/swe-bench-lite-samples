The search results include several files that might be relevant, particularly `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` and `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, which contain functions dealing with trigonometric simplification. In `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`, the `exptrigsimp` function is likely to be of high relevance as it specifically handles the simplification of expressions involving both exponential and trigonometric functions. Additionally, the `trigsimp_old` and `_trigsimp` functions in the same file also deal with trigonometric simplification, potentially relevant to the issue. In `sympy/simplify/fu.py`, several transformations like `TR2i`, `TR3`, and `TR14` are applied to trigonometric expressions, indicating that this file is also highly relevant for achieving the desired simplification. Other files like `sympy/assumptions/handlers/sets.py` and `sympy/plotting/intervalmath/lib_interval.py` are less directly related to the core simplification logic but might still contain utility functions or assumptions handling that could indirectly assist in the task. Based on the detailed analysis of the search results, the identified code spans in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` and `sympy/simplify/fu.py` will be crucial for addressing the issue.",
