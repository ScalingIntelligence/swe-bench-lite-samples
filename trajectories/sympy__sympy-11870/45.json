Specifically, the `sin` and `cos` classes have methods `_eval_rewrite_as_exp` that could potentially be used to achieve the desired simplifications.\n\nThe `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` file contains the `exp` class with methods for evaluating expressions differently, which might be relevant for converting exponential forms back into simpler trigonometric forms. However, the focus should primarily be on `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, as it directly addresses the rewrites of trig functions to exponential forms.\n\nThe `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` file includes a `simplify` function that could potentially be used to further simplify the expressions after rewriting them. Given the nature of the issue, we need to focus on identifying methods that directly rewrite trig functions to exponentials and vice versa, and the `trigsimp` function also in the `simplify` module, as this is likely where the function to simplify expressions should be called.",

In `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, there are methods for rewriting trigonometric functions as exponentials (`_eval_rewrite_as_exp`). In `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, the `simplify` function uses `trigsimp` and `exptrigsimp`. In `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`, there are functions like `exptrigsimp` and `trigsimp_old` that handle simplification of trigonometric expressions.

Furthermore, `sympy/simplify/fu.py` contains strategies for transforming trigonometric expressions, like `TR10i` and `TR12i`.
