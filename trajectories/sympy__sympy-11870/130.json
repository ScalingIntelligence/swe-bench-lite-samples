The `trigsimp` function in `trigsimp.py` is particularly relevant as it handles the simplification of trigonometric expressions, which aligns with the reported issue. Additionally, the `exptrigsimp` function within the same file is also pertinent as it directly deals with simplifying expressions that involve both exponential and trigonometric functions. Furthermore, the `Expr.trigsimp` method in `expr.py` is a wrapper for the `trigsimp` function, indicating that the simplification of trigonometric expressions is a core functionality in the sympy library.

The 'TR2i' function within 'exptrigsimp' could also be significant for handling specific identities like the transformation of exponentials to 'sin' or 'sinc'.
