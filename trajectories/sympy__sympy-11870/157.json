The goal is to use `trigsimp` to reduce expressions involving exponential terms to their trigonometric equivalents, such as converting a function to `sin(k)` or `sinc(k)`. Given the context, investigating functions and methods related to trigonometric simplification, exponential simplification, and specifically the `trigsimp` function in SymPy is essential. The files provided suggest focusing on the `trigsimp.py` and `fu.py` modules, which contain functions like `trigsimp_groebner`, `exptrigsimp`, and `trigsimp_old` that might be relevant for handling such simplification tasks. Additionally, the `trigonometric.py` module contains definitions for trigonometric functions like `sin` and `sinc`, which are the desired outputs for the given expressions.",

The primary metric is the\n    total degree. Some attempts are made to choose the simplest possible\n    expression of the minimal degree, but this is non-rigorous, and also\n    very slow (see the ``quick=True`` option).\n\n    If ``polynomial`` is set to True, instead of simplifying numerator and\n    denominator together, this function just brings numerator and denominator\n    into a canonical form. This is much faster, but has potentially worse\n    results. However, if the input is a polynomial, then the result is\n    guaranteed to be an equivalent polynomial of minimal degree.\n\n    The most important option is hints. Its entries can be any of the\n    following:\n\n    - a natural number\n    - a function\n    - an iterable of the form (func, var1, var2, ...)\n    - anything else, interpreted as a generator\n\n    A number is used to indicate that the search space should be increased.\n    A function is used to indicate that said function is likely to occur in a\n    simplified expression.\n    An iterable is used indicate that func(var1 + var2 + ...) is likely to\n    occur in a simplified .\n    An additional generator also indicates that it is likely to occur.\n    (See examples below).\n\n    This routine carries out various computationally intensive algorithms.\n    The option ``quick=True`` can be used to suppress one particularly slow\n    step (at the expense of potentially more complicated results, but never at\n    the expense of increased total degree).\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> from sympy import sin, tan, cos, sinh, cosh, tanh\n    >>> from sympy.simplify.trigsimp import trigsimp_groebner\n\n    Suppose you want to simplify ``sin(x)*cos(x)``. Naively, nothing happens:\n\n    >>> ex = sin(x)*cos(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex)\n    sin(x)*cos(x)\n\n    This is because ``trigsimp_groebner`` only looks for a simplification\n    involving just ``sin(x)`` and ``cos(x)``. You can tell it to also try\n    ``2*x`` by passing ``hints=[2]``:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[2])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)**2 - cos(x)**2, hints=[2])\n    -cos(2*x)\n\n    Increasing the search space this way can quickly become expensive. A much\n    faster way is to give a specific expression that is likely to occur:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[sin(2*x)])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n\n    Hyperbolic expressions are similarly supported:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(2*x)/sinh(x))\n    2*cosh(x)\n\n    Note how no hints had to be passed, since the expression already involved\n    ``2*x``.\n\n    The tangent function is also supported. You can either pass ``tan`` in the\n    hints, to indicate that than should be tried whenever cosine or sine are,\n    or you can pass a specific generator:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)/cos(x), hints=[tan])\n    tan(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(x)/cosh(x), hints=[tanh(x)])\n    tanh(x)\n\n    Finally, you can use the iterable form to suggest that angle sum formulae\n    should be tried:\n\n    >>> ex = (tan(x) + tan(y))/(1 - tan(x)*tan(y))\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[(tan, x, y)])\n    tan(x + y)\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO\n    #  - preprocess by replacing everything by funcs we can handle\n    # - optionally use cot instead of tan"
