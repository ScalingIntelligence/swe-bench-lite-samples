Given the nature of the problem, it is likely that the solution lies within the `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` file, where `trigsimp` and related functions such as `exptrigsimp`, `trigsimp_old`, and helper functions like `_trigpats` and `_match_div_rewrite` are defined. Additionally, the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file is crucial as it defines the trigonometric functions like `sin` and `sinc`, which are the desired outputs of the simplification. The `sympy/simplify/fu.py` file also contains relevant functions for transformation (`TR2i`, `TR11`, `TR12i`) that may be used within the simplification process.",
