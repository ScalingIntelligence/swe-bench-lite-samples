The `functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file defines the `sinc` class, which is relevant to one of the examples provided in the issue. Additionally, the `fu.py` file contains functions like `TR2i` and `TR11`, which are transformation rules that can be used for simplifying trigonometric identities. These functions and classes are necessary for implementing the requested simplifications from exponential to trigonometric forms, including the conversion to `sin(k)` and `sinc(k)`.
