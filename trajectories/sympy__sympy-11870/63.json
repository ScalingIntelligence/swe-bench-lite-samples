The goal is to transform specific exponential expressions into their trigonometric equivalents, ideally using functions like sin(k) and sinc(k). Given the nature of the problem, it's likely that the key function or method to investigate would be 'trigsimp' or related simplification functions in SymPy. Relevant files appear to be those defining trigonometric functions, simplification methods, and possibly integration rules, as integrals often involve trigonometric and exponential simplifications. It would be prudent to focus on files where 'trigsimp', trigonometric functions, and the 'trig' related math operations are defined or used.",

The search results provided include definitions and functions related to trigonometric identities in sympy, such as `sin`, `sinc`, and `trigsimp`. These functions are crucial for the simplification process. The `trigsimp` function in particular is central to the task, as it encapsulates the logic for simplifying trigonometric expressions, including handling identities related to `sin`, `cos`, and `exp`. Additionally, the `sinc` function's methods like `fdiff`, `eval`, and its rewrite methods suggest that `sinc` can be expressed in terms of `sin`, which aligns with the corollary mentioned in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans from the search results that deal with these specific trigonometric functions and identities are likely to be pivotal in addressing the issue.

The primary metric is the\n    total degree. Some attempts are made to choose the simplest possible\n    expression of the minimal degree, but this is non-rigorous, and also\n    very slow (see the ``quick=True`` option).\n\n    If ``polynomial`` is set to True, instead of simplifying numerator and\n    denominator together, this function just brings numerator and denominator\n    into a canonical form. This is much faster, but has potentially worse\n    results. However, if the input is a polynomial, then the result is\n    guaranteed to be an equivalent polynomial of minimal degree.\n\n    The most important option is hints. Its entries can be any of the\n    following:\n\n    - a natural number\n    - a function\n    - an iterable of the form (func, var1, var2, ...)\n    - anything else, interpreted as a generator\n\n    A number is used to indicate that the search space should be increased.\n    A function is used to indicate that said function is likely to occur in a\n    simplified expression.\n    An iterable is used indicate that func(var1 + var2 + ...) is likely to\n    occur in a simplified .\n    An additional generator also indicates that it is likely to occur.\n    (See examples below).\n\n    This routine carries out various computationally intensive algorithms.\n    The option ``quick=True`` can be used to suppress one particularly slow\n    step (at the expense of potentially more complicated results, but never at\n    the expense of increased total degree).\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> from sympy import sin, tan, cos, sinh, cosh, tanh\n    >>> from sympy.simplify.trigsimp import trigsimp_groebner\n\n    Suppose you want to simplify ``sin(x)*cos(x)``. Naively, nothing happens:\n\n    >>> ex = sin(x)*cos(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex)\n    sin(x)*cos(x)\n\n    This is because ``trigsimp_groebner`` only looks for a simplification\n    involving just ``sin(x)`` and ``cos(x)``. You can tell it to also try\n    ``2*x`` by passing ``hints=[2]``:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[2])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)**2 - cos(x)**2, hints=[2])\n    -cos(2*x)\n\n    Increasing the search space this way can quickly become expensive. A much\n    faster way is to give a specific expression that is likely to occur:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[sin(2*x)])\n    sin(2*x)/2\n\n    Hyperbolic expressions are similarly supported:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(2*x)/sinh(x))\n    2*cosh(x)\n\n    Note how no hints had to be passed, since the expression already involved\n    ``2*x``.\n\n    The tangent function is also supported. You can either pass ``tan`` in the\n    hints, to indicate that than should be tried whenever cosine or sine are,\n    or you can pass a specific generator:\n\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sin(x)/cos(x), hints=[tan])\n    tan(x)\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(sinh(x)/cosh(x), hints=[tanh(x)])\n    tanh(x)\n\n    Finally, you can use the iterable form to suggest that angle sum formulae\n    should be tried:\n\n    >>> ex = (tan(x) + tan(y))/(1 - tan(x)*tan(y))\n    >>> trigsimp_groebner(ex, hints=[(tan, x, y)])\n    tan(x + y)\n    \"\"\"\n    # TODO\n    #  - preprocess by replacing everything by funcs we can handle\n</replace>"
