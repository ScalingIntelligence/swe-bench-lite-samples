This suggests that the substitution mechanism or the handling of such undefined cases within the sympy library is not functioning as expected. To address this, it's crucial to look at the code responsible for substitutions in expressions, particularly how they handle cases where the substitution results in an undefined expression, and understanding how limits are computed when such cases occur. The provided search results include two key files: 'sympy/core/basic.py' and 'sympy/series/limits.py'. The 'basic.py' file contains the '_subs' method which is central to the substitution functionality. The '_eval_subs' method is also present but is primarily a placeholder, implying the implementation might be in the '_subs' method. Additionally, the 'limits.py' file includes the 'limit' function and its helper functions, which manage the computation of limits when regular substitution fails, which directly relates to the reported issue of substitution leading to undefined expressions. These sections of the code are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue, as they cover the substitution and limit computation functionalities expected to handle such scenarios. Considering these connections, the relevant spans identified will focus on the substitution and limit computation components.",
