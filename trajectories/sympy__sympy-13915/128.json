The focus should be on the `subs` method and how SymPy handles substitutions that result in undefined expressions. The relevant files and classes seem to be those dealing with expressions and their substitutions, such as `Basic`, `Expr`, `Mul`, `Add`, and `Pow`. Additionally, the `limit` function in `sympy.series.limits` might also be relevant as it provides a workaround to the issue.",

The `Basic.subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` handles the substitution of variables in expressions.\n2. The `Basic._subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` is a cached version of the substitution method and also handles the fallback logic.\n3. The `Derivative._eval_subs` method in `sympy/core/function.py` deals with the substitution in derivatives.\n4. The `Subs._eval_subs` method in `sympy/core/function.py` handles the substitution in the `Subs` class, which is used for symbolic substitutions.\n5. The `ExprWithLimits._eval_subs` method in `sympy/concrete/expr_with_limits.py` handles substitution in expressions with limits.\n6. The `Pow._eval_subs` method in `sympy/core/power.py` deals with substitution in power expressions.\n7. The `Mul._eval_subs` method in `sympy/core/mul.py` handles substitution in multiplication expressions.\n8. The `exp._eval_subs` method in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` deals with substitution in exponential functions.\n\nThese methods cover the core functionality related to substitution in various types of expressions within SymPy.
