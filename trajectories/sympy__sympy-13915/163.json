The `Basic.subs` method is particularly relevant as it implements the substitution logic which fails to handle cases leading to undefined expressions like the one reported. Additionally, the `Expr.limit` method is relevant for calculating limits, which could potentially handle such cases if integrated into the substitution logic. These spans provide a starting point for addressing the issue by either adjusting the substitution logic to handle undefined cases or integrating limit calculations where necessary.",
