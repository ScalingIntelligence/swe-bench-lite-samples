The issue involves a substitution that leads to an undefined expression, where substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression 'r' results in an undefined state. We need to find the code responsible for handling substitutions in SymPy. In the provided search results, 'sympy/core/function.py' contains a class 'Subs' which appears to be responsible for substitution operations. Key methods in this class such as '__new__', 'doit', and 'subs' seem relevant as they handle the creation and execution of substitutions. Additionally, 'sympy/core/basic.py' contains the 'subs' method for the 'Basic' class, which is a more general substitution mechanism that could also be related to the issue. Finally, 'sympy/series/limits.py' contains the 'limit' function and 'Limit' class, which handle limits calculation, which is mentioned as an alternative to handle the undefined state in the reported issue. These methods and classes are likely to contain code that can help resolve the reported issue regarding substitutions leading to undefined expressions.",
