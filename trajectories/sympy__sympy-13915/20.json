Specifically, substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression 'r' leads to an undefined result, even though the limit calculation shows it should be -1. To identify the root cause of this issue, it is essential to focus on the substitution mechanism and limit handling in SymPy.

The `Basic.subs` method handles general substitution, while `Add._eval_subs` specifically deals with substitution within addition expressions, which is relevant given the expression `r` involves sums and differences of fractions. \n\nAdditionally, examining `Pow._eval_subs` is crucial because the undefined issue might arise from improper handling of powers after substitution, especially since the substitution involves a denominator that could become zero.\n\nBy analyzing these specific code spans, we can understand how SymPy currently handles such substitutions and identify potential areas for improvement or error handling to prevent undefined expressions.",

The issue is described in the context of the `subs` method in SymPy, particularly with the `Basic.subs` method and its counterparts in `Add` and `Pow`. The provided search results include various parts of the SymPy codebase that are relevant to the issue, such as `Expr.limit`, `MatrixCalculus.limit`, and `TupleArg.limit`, but these primarily deal with limits rather than substitutions.
