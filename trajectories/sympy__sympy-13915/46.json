            "scratch_pad": "To investigate the reported issue, I first reviewed the issue description, which involves an undefined expression when substituting 'b' with 'a' in a SymPy expression. The issue suggests that when a subexpression becomes undefined, the entire expression should be considered undefined. The suggested solution involves calculating the limit when 'b' tends to 'a' instead of direct substitution.\n\nI then analyzed the search results, focusing on the 'subs' method in sympy/core/basic.py, which is responsible for substitution in expressions. This method handles the substitution process and includes checks for sympifying arguments and handling simultaneous substitutions, which could be relevant to avoid undefined results.\n\nNext, I looked at sympy/series/limits.py, which contains the 'limit' function and the 'Limit' class. These are crucial for handling limits, which could be used to address the undefined expression issue by evaluating the limit instead of substituting directly. The 'limit' function and the 'Limit' class in this file are designed to compute limits, which is directly relevant to the issue's suggestion of using limits to handle undefined expressions.\n\nFinally, I reviewed sympy/core/expr.py, which contains the 'Expr' class with a 'limit' method that delegates to the 'limit' function in sympy/series/limits.py. This confirms that the 'Expr' class, which represents mathematical expressions in SymPy, has built-in support for handling limits.\n\nBased on this analysis, I identified the following code spans as relevant to the reported issue:\n- The 'subs' method in sympy/core/basic.py for handling substitutions.\n- The 'limit' function and the 'Limit' class in sympy/series/limits.py for handling limits.\n- The 'limit' method in the 'Expr' class in sympy/core/expr.py for integrating limit handling into expression objects.",
