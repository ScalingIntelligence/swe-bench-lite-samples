The reported issue involves the `subs` method in Sympy's symbolic expressions, particularly when substituting `b` with `a` in a specific expression. The issue also discusses limits and undefined expressions, indicating the need to review limit computation functions and the `subs` method itself. In the given search results, we find several relevant files such as `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/series/limits.py`, and others, which contain methods like `Basic.subs`, `Pow._eval_subs`, `Mul._eval_subs`, and `limit`. These methods are critical for handling substitutions and computing limits, which are central to the reported issue. We will focus on these spans specifically to determine their relevance to the issue. Additionally, we need to check if these methods properly handle cases where substitutions lead to undefined expressions or need improvements in handling such cases.",
