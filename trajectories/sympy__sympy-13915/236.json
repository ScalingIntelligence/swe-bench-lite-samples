Specifically, substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression r leads to an undefined result. This suggests that there might be a problem with how substitutions are handled in the library, particularly in the `subs` method or related functions. To address this, we need to search for the implementation of the `subs` method and any associated handling of undefined expressions or divisions by zero. Additionally, since the limit function correctly handles the substitution by computing the limit, it's also worth examining how the limit is calculated to understand the difference in behavior compared to the `subs` method.",

Given the provided context and search results, the relevant portions of the codebase that deal with the substitution functionality are located in `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/function.py`, and `sympy/core/expr.py`. These files contain methods such as `subs`, `_subs`, `_eval_subs`, and `Subs`, which are central to the substitution process. Particularly, the `Subs` class handles the substitution of expressions at specific points, and its methods like `_eval_nseries`, which are pertinent to the reported issue as they involve evaluating expressions and handling sequences of operations related to substitution and limit calculations, have been identified as relevant code spans. Moreover, the `Basic.subs` and `Basic._subs` methods in `sympy/core/basic.py` are crucial for understanding how substitutions are managed in the broader context of SymPy's expression handling. These methods handle the substitution process, including how they manage simultaneous substitutions and how they deal with exceptions that might arise during the substitution process, which is directly related to the undefined expression issue reported.",
