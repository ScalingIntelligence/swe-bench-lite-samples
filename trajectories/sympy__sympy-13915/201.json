Notably, the `_eval_subs` method is present in various classes such as `ExprWithLimits`, `Basic`, `Expr`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Function`, `Subs`, `Add`, and `Piecewise`. These methods are crucial for handling substitutions, which is directly related to the issue. Additionally, the `subs` method in the `Basic` class and the `limit` method in the `Expr` class are also identified as relevant. The file context thus provides the necessary scope and codebase coverage to understand and potentially address the issue regarding substitutions leading to undefined expressions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the relevant file context has been provided to deal with the reported issue.",
