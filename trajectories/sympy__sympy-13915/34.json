This suggests that the problem might be in the substitution logic within SymPy's core or expression handling modules. The provided context includes multiple files that handle expressions, substitutions, and limits within SymPy. Focus should be on the '_eval_subs' method in classes like 'Mul', 'Add', 'Basic', and 'Expr', as well as the 'subs' method in 'Basic'. Additionally, considering the limit function provided in 'sympy/series/limits.py' is a hint that the issue might be addressed with a limit check before or after substitution.

We will focus on code spans that involve the methods `_eval_subs` for substitution handling and methods related to limit evaluation. These methods are crucial for detecting and resolving issues where substitutions lead to undefined expressions. Given the context from `sympy/core/mul.py` and `sympy/core/add.py`, we already have identified significant portions of code dealing with multiplication and addition operations, which are foundational for understanding how substitutions and limits might be managed within these operations. The new search results from `sympy/series/limits.py` offer additional insights into the symbolic limit calculation, which complements our understanding of handling undefined expressions. By carefully analyzing these code spans, we aim to find the most relevant sections that directly address the reported issue.",
