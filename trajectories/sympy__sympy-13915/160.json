Additionally, the `Limit` class and its methods should be examined to confirm they can handle such cases appropriately.",

The issue is specifically about handling substitutions where the result becomes undefined, such as substituting `b` with `a` in a rational expression leading to division by zero. The `Basic.subs` method is a crucial entry point for substitution operations, and it needs to handle cases where substitutions result in undefined expressions. Additionally, specialized methods like `Mul._eval_subs` and `Add._eval_subs` are likely to be relevant as they handle substitutions in more specific contexts (multiplicative and additive expressions, respectively). Since the issue involves handling undefined subexpressions within larger expressions, we should also consider methods like `Pow._eval_subs` which might handle powers of expressions potentially leading to undefined results.

The user provides an example where substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression 'r' results in an undefined expression, even though the limit can be calculated using 'r.limit(b, a)'. The codebase contains several relevant files and methods that handle substitutions (like 'Basic.subs', 'Basic._subs', 'Mul._eval_subs', 'Add._eval_subs', 'Pow._eval_subs') and limits ('limit', 'Limit.doit'). The new search results include the 'limit' function and the 'Limit.doit' method, which are central to handling limits and substitutions that might lead to undefined expressions.
