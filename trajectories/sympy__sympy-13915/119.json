Specifically, substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r` results in an undefined expression, even though the limit can be calculated as -1. This suggests that the problem might be in the handling of substitutions that could lead to undefined expressions. Given the context, the focus should be on classes and functions related to substitution, expression handling, and possibly limit calculation within SymPy. The relevant classes include Basic, Expr, Mul, and Add, and relevant functions involve subs, limit, and _eval_subs.",

The user wants the substitution to handle cases where the substituted value makes the expression undefined and to possibly calculate the limit in such cases.\n\nThe relevant parts of the codebase to look at are those that handle substitutions and limits, namely the `subs` method and related functions within classes like `Basic`, `Expr`, `Mul`, `Add`, `Pow`, `Derivative`, `Subs`, `exp`, and `Piecewise`. These classes and their methods are responsible for the symbolic manipulation that could potentially lead to undefined expressions.\n\nLooking at the search results, I will identify the code spans that directly relate to the `subs` method and handling undefined expressions.",

The user expects the result to be `-1` using the `limit` function. 2. **Reviewing Current Context:** The current file context includes relevant classes such as `Basic`, `Expr`, `Mul`, `Add`, and `Pow` with methods like `subs`, `_eval_subs`, and `limit`. 3. **Processing New Search Results:** In the new search results, several files and methods are relevant:  - `Basic.subs` and `Basic._subs` in `sympy/core/basic.py`: These handle the substitution logic. - `Expr.limit` in `sympy/core/expr.py`: This is relevant due to the user's mention of the `limit` function. - `Mul._eval_subs` and `Add._eval_subs` in respective files: These handle the substitution in multiplication and addition contexts. - `Pow._eval_subst` in `sympy/core/power.py`: This is relevant for handling power substitutions. 4. **Identified Relevant Code Spans:** The methods `subs`, `_eval_subs`, and `limit` are crucial for addressing the issue. The spans that are relevant from the new search results are: - `Basic.subs`, `Basic._subs` in `sympy/core/basic.py` - `Expr.limit` in `sympy/core/expr.py` - `Mul._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/mul.py` - `Add._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/add.py` - `Pow._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/power.py`",
