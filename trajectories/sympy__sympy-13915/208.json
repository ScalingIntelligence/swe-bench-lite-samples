The user is specifically looking at the behavior of the `subs` method when substituting `b` with `a` in an expression `r`. The expression `r` becomes undefined when `b` is substituted by `a`, leading to a division by zero. The focus is on understanding and potentially fixing or improving the handling of such cases within the SymPy library. The search results show relevant code spans primarily from `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. In `basic.py`, the `subs` method of the `Basic` class is found, which is crucial for understanding how substitutions are handled. Additionally, in `expr.py`, the `limit` method of the `Expr` class is relevant, as the user mentions using limits to handle undefined expressions. These code spans directly relate to the functionality discussed in the issue, making them highly relevant to the problem at hand.",
