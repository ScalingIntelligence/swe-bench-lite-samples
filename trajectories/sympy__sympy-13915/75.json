The core functionality of substitution and handling undefined expressions lies within the sympy.core module, particularly in the classes like Mul, Basic, Expr, and their methods such as _eval_subs and subs. To address this, we should focus on these classes and their methods where substitution logic is implemented. Additionally, considering the existence of limit calculation methods like in sympy.series.limits suggests deeper integration of these context checks or exceptions handling during substitutions. Therefore, the search should target these specific modules and functions related to substitution and limit handling in the SymPy library.",

Specifically, the user is attempting to substitute 'b' with 'a' in an expression and finds that the expression becomes undefined. They then suggest calculating the limit as a workaround. The relevant code spans for this issue are likely to be found in the implementations of the 'subs' and 'limit' functions in SymPy.\n\nUpon examining the search results, we find the 'subs' method within the 'Basic' class in 'sympy/core/basic.py'. This implementation handles the substitution process as described in the issue. Additionally, in 'sympy/series/limits.py', we find the 'limit' function and the 'Limit' class, which are used to calculate limits, as suggested by the user as a workaround for the undefined expression issue. It's also notable that the 'heuristics' function within 'limits.py' contains logic related to handling limits of different types of expressions, which could be relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nGiven the context of the issue and the functionality described, it appears that the identified code spans in 'sympy/core/basic.py' and 'sympy/series/limits.py' are relevant to addressing the problem reported. These spans include the 'subs' method for substitution, the 'limit' function for calculating limits, and the 'Limit' class for handling limits in general. The 'heuristics' function provides additional context on how limits are handled for different types of expressions, which could be relevant for understanding why the substitution leads to an undefined expression in this specific case.",
