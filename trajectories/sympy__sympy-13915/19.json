This suggests that the substitution mechanism in SymPy might be failing to handle such cases correctly. The relevant code spans that need to be reviewed are those related to the 'subs' method in SymPy's core module, as well as any related methods like '_eval_subs', '_subs', and 'replace'. These methods are responsible for handling substitutions in expressions. The provided search results include multiple relevant code spans in the 'core' module, particularly in files like 'sympy/core/basic.py', 'sympy/core/expr.py', 'sympy/core/add.py', and 'sympy/core/mul.py'. These spans contain the implementation of the 'subs' method and its related functionalities, which are directly relevant to the reported issue. Additionally, the 'subs' method is found in 'sympy/core/basic.py' and 'sympy/core/add.py'. These spans need to be carefully analyzed to understand how substitutions are handled and to determine if they correctly manage cases where a substitution leads to an undefined expression. The code spans related to 'subs' in 'sympy/core/basic.py' and '_eval_subs' in 'sympy/core/add.py' and 'sympy/core/mul.py' are particularly important as they handle the substitution logic. Furthermore, the 'limit' function in 'sympy/series/limits.py' is also relevant, as it provides an alternative way to handle undefined expressions using limits.",
