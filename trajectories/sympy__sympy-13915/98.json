Specifically, the user is substituting 'a' for 'b' in a complex expression which results in an undefined state. The user is looking for either a way to handle this substitution without leading to an undefined state or a method to calculate the limit when the substitution leads to such an undefined state. The search results contain several key functions from SymPy's core and series modules that are likely relevant to this issue. These include `Basic.subs`, `Add._eval_subs`, `Mul._eval_subs`, `Pow._eval_subs`, and the `limit` function from `sympy.series.limits`. These functions are crucial for evaluating substitutions and handling limits which are directly related to the user's reported issue. The `Basic.subs` method is particularly relevant as it is responsible for performing substitutions in expressions and could be where the undefined state originates. The `_eval_subs` methods in `Add`, `Mul`, and `Pow` classes provide more specific handling of substitutions for these types of operations. The limit function provides a way to handle undefined states by calculating the limit of an expression as a variable approaches a particular value, which is exactly what the user is attempting to do to avoid the undefined state caused by the substitution. Given the nature of the issue, these code spans are likely to be relevant in understanding and resolving the problem.",
