The main problem is when substituting 'b' with 'a', the expression becomes undefined. To address this, we need to look into the handling of substitutions in SymPy's core modules, focusing on how expressions are managed during and after substitutions. Specifically, the classes and methods related to substitutions, such as `subs` and `_eval_subs`, should be investigated to understand how they handle such edge cases where a substitution could lead to an undefined expression.",

The provided file context includes several core modules of SymPy, such as basic.py, add.py, power.py, mul.py, and expr.py. These files contain methods and classes related to the evaluation and substitution of expressions. Notably, the `subs` method in basic.py and the `_eval_subs` methods in the respective classes (Add, Pow, Mul) are central to substitution operations. The code scrutinizes the handling of substitutions, including the case where substitutions could lead to undefined expressions.
