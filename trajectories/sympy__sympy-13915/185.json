Specifically, the substitution of 'b' by 'a' in the expression r results in an undefined expression. This problem needs to be addressed in SymPy's substitution and limit calculation mechanisms. The relevant files include those handling basic operations, expressions, limits, and substitutions. From the provided context, the key files to focus on are those that define core classes like Basic, Expr, and Mul, as well as files dedicated to handling limits and substitutions such as limits.py, basic.py, and expr.py. Additionally, since the substitution involves algebraic operations, files like mul.py, add.py, and power.py are also relevant. The function names and class names to focus on include 'subs', 'limit', '_eval_subs', and associated methods within these classes.",

The issue of substituting 'b' with 'a' leading to an undefined expression can be address through the optimization of substitution logic, which is handled by '_eval_subs'. Additionally, the behavior around evaluating limits when substitutions lead to undefined expressions might involve tweaking the 'matches' method. The sympy/series/limits.py file context provides the 'Limit' class and the 'limit' function, which indicates that SymPy's limit handling is centralized in this part of the code, reinforcing the idea that handling undefined expressions post-substitution could be managed here. Overall, these file contexts provide a comprehensive view of where the relevant code to resolve the substitution issue resides within the SymPy repository.
