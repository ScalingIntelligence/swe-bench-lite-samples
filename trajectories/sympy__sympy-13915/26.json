The provided files and code snippets suggest focusing on the implementation of the 'subs' method and related functionalities in 'sympy/core' directory, as well as methods like '_eval_subs' that handle substitution. Additionally, understanding how expressions are evaluated and handled in contexts like limits is crucial due to mentions of using limits to calculate undefined subexpressions. Identifying the functions and classes involved in these processes can help pinpoint where the substitution logic fails under certain conditions.",

This requires understanding the behavior of the `subs` method in SymPy and how it handles cases where the substitution results in an undefined expression. The relevant code spans to look for would include the implementation of the `subs` method and any related methods that handle undefined expressions or limits. The search results provide several candidate code spans, including `sympy/core/basic.py` where the `subs` method is defined, `sympy/series/limits.py` where the `limit` and `Limit` classes are defined, and `sympy/core/function.py` where the `Subs` class is defined. These classes and methods are directly related to the handling of substitutions and limits in SymPy. By analyzing these code spans, we can understand how SymPy handles substitutions and undefined expressions, which will be crucial for addressing the reported issue.",
