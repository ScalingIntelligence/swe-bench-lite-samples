The central problem is how SymPy handles substitutions that result in undefined expressions, suggesting that the `_eval_subs` method and related methods in classes like `Expr`, `Basic`, and `Mul` may be relevant. Additionally, the `limit` function and its handling in `Expr` are crucial as the issue can be mitigated by calculating the limit instead of direct substitution. Thus, focusing on these methods and classes should be the primary approach to locate the relevant code.",
