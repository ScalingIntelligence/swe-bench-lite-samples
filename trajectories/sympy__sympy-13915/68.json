The expression 'r' becomes undefined when 'b' is substituted by 'a' due to division by zero. This is likely due to how substitutions are handled in the '_eval_subs' methods of the classes involved (like 'Mul', 'Add', 'Expr', etc.). To address this, we should focus on these core files for understanding and potential modifications to handle such cases where substitutions lead to undefined results.",

            "scratch_pad": "1. Analyzing the reported issue: The issue involves a substitution in SymPy that leads to an undefined expression. Specifically, when substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, the expression becomes undefined. The goal is to handle such cases more gracefully, potentially by calculating limits instead of directly substituting.\n\n2. Reviewing the provided search results: The search results include various SymPy modules such as `mul.py`, `add.py`, `power.py`, `function.py`, and `basic.py`. These modules contain classes like `Mul`, `Add`, `Pow`, `Derivative`, and methods like `_eval_subs`, `_eval_derivative`, `_eval_evalf`, etc. These methods are critical for evaluating expressions and handling substitutions.\n\n3. Identifying relevant code spans: Given the issue involves substitution leading to undefined expressions, the focus is on methods that handle substitutions and evaluations. Notably, the `_eval_subs` methods in `mul.py`, `add.py`, `power.py`, and `function.py` are particularly relevant as they directly deal with substitution logic. Additionally, the `_eval_derivative` method in `mul.py` could also be relevant for understanding how expressions are handled during differentiation or evaluation.\n\n4. Deciding on the search task completion: Although the provided search results cover significant aspects of SymPy's core functionality related to the issue, a comprehensive solution might require deeper integration across multiple methods and potentially additional modules not covered in the initial search results. Thus, the search task is not fully complete, but the identified code spans provide a foundational context for addressing the issue.",

Specifically, when substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, the expression becomes undefined. This suggests that the issue lies within the substitution mechanics of SymPy, particularly in how `Mul`, `Add`, and `Pow` classes handle substitutions. The current context already identifies relevant spans in `sympy/core/mul.py`, `sympy/core/add.py`, and `sympy/core/power.py` that deal with `_eval_subs` methods. From the new search results, additional spans are found in these files, which may be relevant, as well as in other files like `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py`. The `_eval_subs` methods in these files are critical for understanding how substitutions are handled within SymPy, and any issues related to undefined expressions during substitution would likely be found in these methods. Thus, these spans should be reviewed for deeper analysis and to identify potential fixes.",
