The expected behavior is to handle such cases by calculating the limit instead of resulting in an undefined expression. From the search results, the key code spans to focus on are the ones related to the 'subs' method in 'Basic' class (sympy/core/basic.py) and the 'limit' method in 'Expr' class (sympy/core/expr.py). These methods are directly related to the operations mentioned in the issue. The 'subs' method in 'Basic' class defines how substitutions are made in SymPy expressions, and the 'limit' method in 'Expr' class is responsible for calculating limits, which is the workaround suggested for handling undefined expressions. Identifying these spans will allow for a better understanding of how to address the issue by potentially modifying or enhancing these methods to handle such cases more gracefully.",
