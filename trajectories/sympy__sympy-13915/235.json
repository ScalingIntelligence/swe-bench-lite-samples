The issue states that if 'b' is substituted by 'a', 'r' becomes undefined, and suggests that calculating the limit as 'b' approaches 'a' may yield a result. Given this, the relevant code spans are likely those that deal with substitution (subs) and limit calculations in SymPy. The analysis of search results reveals several key areas in the codebase: 1. 'Subs' class in 'sympy/core/function.py' defines the behavior of substitution operations. 2. 'limit' function and 'Limit' class in 'sympy/series/limits.py' handle limit calculations. 3. 'subs' method in 'Basic' class in 'sympy/core/basic.py' also deals with substitution. 4. 'limit' method in 'Expr' class in 'sympy/core/expr.py' links to the limit function. These code spans collectively address the core functionalities relevant to the reported issue.",
