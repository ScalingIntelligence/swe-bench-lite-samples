The key parts are understanding how substitution (`subs`) works, particularly when dealing with undefined expressions like dividing by zero. 2. From the reported issue, the focus should be on code spans related to handling substitutions (`subs`) and managing undefined expressions. 3. In the provided search results, multiple files contain relevant code spans. Specifically, `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/expr.py`, and `sympy/series/limits.py` are of particular interest due to their handling of substitutions and limits, which are central to managing undefined expressions. 4. Within these files, functions like `subs`, `limit`, and evaluation methods like `_eval_subs` are relevant. These functions are responsible for substituting values into expressions and evaluating their limits, which is crucial for addressing the reported issue. 5. Given the issue's focus on substitution leading to undefined expressions, the identified code spans provide the necessary context to understand how sympy handles such cases. This understanding is crucial for suggesting improvements or fixes related to the reported issue.",
