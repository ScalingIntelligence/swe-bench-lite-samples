The focus should be on the substitution logic within SymPy's core modules, particularly where expressions are handled and substituted. The `subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `_eval_subs` in `sympy/core/expr.py` are relevant starting points, as well as any similar methods across related classes like Mul, Add, Pow, etc. Additionally, since the problem arises when a variable substitution leads to a division by zero, methods handling division and expressions in a similar manner might also be relevant. Including the `_combine_inverse` method hint provided could help identify the problem. Finally, exploring the relation of substitution with limits when approaching undefined expressions might shed more light on the issue.",

The provided search results include various files and spans of code that deal with substitution, limits, and expressions in SymPy. The most relevant code spans are those handling the `_eval_subs` method in classes like `Pow`, `Mul`, `Basic`, and `Add`, as these directly relate to substituting variables in expressions. Additionally, the `limit` function and `Limit` class from `sympy/series/limits.py` are relevant for handling undefined expressions by calculating limits.

The user provided an example where substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression 'r' results in an undefined expression 'r.subs(b, a)'. The user seeks to handle cases where a subexpression becomes undefined, such as calculating the limit using 'r.limit(b, a)' to get '-1'.\n\n2. Review Current Context:\nCurrent file context shows relevant files like 'sympy/core/mul.py', 'sympy/core/pow.py', 'sympy/core/basic.py', and 'sympy/core/add.py'. These files contain code related to multiplication, power, basic operations, and addition in SymPy. The '_eval_subs' methods in these files are particularly relevant as they handle the substitution functionality.\n\n3. Processing New Search Results:\n3.1. Analyzing code spans in 'sympy/core/mul.py', 'sympy/core/power.py', and 'sympy/core/function.py'. These files contain methods '_combine_inverse', '_eval_is_negative', '_eval_is_zero', and '_eval_subs' which are relevant to handling undefined expressions and substitutions.\n3.2. Key elements such as 'Pow._eval_subs', 'Mul._eval_subs', and 'Derivative._eval_subs' are important as they handle the substitution logic.\n3.3. Evaluating relevance: The '_eval_subs' methods in 'Pow', 'Mul', and 'Derivative' classes are directly relevant as they handle the substitution logic. The '_combine_inverse' method in 'Add' class is also relevant as it deals with combining and inverse operations which could impact substitution logic.\n3.4. No new functions or classes suggested by the issue. The issue focuses on enhancing the existing substitution handling.\n3.5. Reviewing entire sections of code to ensure understanding before making a decision, especially the '_eval_subs' methods in 'Pow' and 'Mul' since they handle the core substitution logic.\n3.6. References to other parts of the codebase are within the provided search results, focusing on enhancing the '_eval_subs' methods.\n3.7.

Specifically, the _eval_subs method in each of the core classes (Pow, Mul, Basic, Add) is detailed, which is crucial for understanding the handling of substitutions within various mathematical expressions. The issue reported, concerning substitutions leading to undefined expressions, particularly with respect to division by zero scenarios, aligns with the functionalities examined in these methods. For instance, the _eval_subs method in Pow class includes handling of such scenarios with detailed checks for commutative and non-commutative elements during substitution. Additionally, the file context includes sympy/series/limits.py, which is directly relevant as it focuses on limit computation. Therefore, this file is crucial for understanding the behavior of expressions as they approach undefined points when substitutions occur. Overall, the context provides significant insight into how SymPy might handle and potentially manage such issues.",
