The substitution `r.subs(b, a)` results in an undefined expression when `r` includes a division by zero. This highlights a potential flaw in how SymPy handles substitutions that lead to undefined operations. To address this, we should focus on the `_eval_subs` method in classes like `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, and `Expr`, as well as the `subs` method in the `Basic` class. Additionally, the `limit` function and its associated classes should be examined to ensure proper handling of such cases.",
