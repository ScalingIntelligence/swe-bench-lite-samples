The user is looking for a way to handle such cases where a subexpression becomes undefined. The relevant code spans are identified in `sympy/core/basic.py` from the `subs` method, which is responsible for performing substitutions. This method checks for various substitution types and handles them accordingly. Another relevant part is the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, which is used for calculating limits, which could be a potential solution for handling undefined expressions. Additionally, the `substitution` function in `sympy/solvers/solveset.py` may also be relevant as it deals with symbol substitutions and solution sets.
