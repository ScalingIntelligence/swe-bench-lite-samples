The `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py` contains the `subs` method, which is central to the issue at hand. Additionally, the `Limit` class in `sympy/series/limits.py` is crucial for handling undefined expressions, as suggested in the issue description. The `_eval_subs` method in the `Add` class from `sympy/core/add.py` is also relevant for handling substitutions in arithmetic operations. Furthermore, the `limit` method in the `Expr` class from `sympy/core/expr.py` ensures that the limit calculation functionality is accessible from expressions. Given these components, it seems that the provided file context covers the relevant parts necessary to understand and potentially address the substitution leading to an undefined expression issue.",
