The issue arises because the substitution leads to an undefined expression. The search results contain several files and methods related to 'subs' and '_eval_subs', which are central to the functionality of substitution in SymPy. The 'Basic.subs' method in 'sympy/core/basic.py' is a central piece of code, handling the substitution process, and uses '_eval_subs' for evaluating substitutions. 'Function._eval_subs' in 'sympy/core/function.py' also plays a role, as it handles function-specific substitutions. The 'Pow._eval_subs' in 'sympy/core/power.py' and 'Mul._eval_subs' in 'sympy/core/mul.py' are also relevant as they handle substitutions for powers and multiplications, which are fundamental in mathematical expressions. These sections of code are likely to contain the logic that needs to be examined or adjusted to handle the undefined substitution issue properly. Given the complexity of the issue, a thorough review of these sections is necessary to identify where handling undefined expressions can be improved.",
