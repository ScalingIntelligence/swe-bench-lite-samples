This suggests that the '_eval_subs' method, possibly in classes like 'Mul', 'Add', or 'Pow', might need to handle cases where the substitution results in an undefined expression more gracefully. Additionally, the 'subs' method in the 'Basic' class could also be relevant as it is the higher-level method that users interact with. Furthermore, the 'limit' method in the 'Expr' class is referenced for calculating the limit when 'b' approaches 'a', which indicates an alternative approach to dealing with the undefined expression. Focusing on these classes and methods should provide insight into how SymPy handles such cases.",
