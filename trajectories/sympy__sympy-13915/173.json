The key elements to look for in the code are the implementations of the `subs` method and `_eval_subs` method across different classes, especially where these methods handle cases that could lead to undefined expressions. The search results include implementations of `subs` and `_eval_subs` in various classes such as `Basic`, `ExprWithLimits`, `Application`, `Derivative`, `exp`, `Pow`, `Mul`, `Piecewise`, `Add`, `PolyElement`, `Order`, `Vector`, and others. These implementations provide the core functionality for substituting values into expressions and evaluating the results. Some implementations, like `Derivative._eval_subs` and `Piecewise._eval_subs`, show specific handling of substitution cases that are relevant to the reported issue of undefined expressions. For instance, `Derivative._eval_subs` handles cases where substitution into derivatives could lead to undefined results, and `Piecewise._eval_subs` manages substitutions within piecewise functions where conditions could evaluate to undefined states. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue and provide insight into how substitutions are handled in different contexts within the sympy codebase. These spans can be used to further investigate and potentially resolve the issue by ensuring that substitutions do not lead to undefined expressions.",

These implementations cover handling substitutions in algebraic expressions, trigonometric functions, and even matrices, demonstrating a broad coverage of contexts where substitution is critical. Additionally, the context includes handling of undefined expressions, which is directly relevant to the reported issue where substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression leads to an undefined expression (division by zero).
