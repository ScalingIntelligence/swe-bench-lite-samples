I will examine the '_eval_subs' methods in various classes in the SymPy codebase to understand how substitutions are managed and how undefined expressions might be handled or propagated.\n\nFrom the search results, I will focus on the following spans:\n1. 'Basic.subs' in 'sympy/core/basic.py' - This method is fundamental for substitution handling.\n2. 'Application._eval_subs' in 'sympy/core/function.py' - This handles substitutions in function applications.\n3.
