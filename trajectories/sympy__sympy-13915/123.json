The problematic substitution is `b` being replaced by `a`, which makes the expression `r` undefined. This suggests that the issue might be related to how SymPy handles substitutions and the evaluation of expressions when they become undefined. The relevant files identified from the partial context include those handling core operations like multiplication, addition, and basic expressions, as well as those specific to solving, simplifying, and evaluating limits and integrals. This narrows down the search to specific areas within the SymPy codebase.",

The reported issue involves a substitution that leads to an undefined expression in a mathematical computation using SymPy, specifically when substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression 'r'. This issue is related to the 'subs' method in the 'Basic' class and potentially involves handling undefined expressions and limits within SymPy.\n2. The current file context shows no relevant code identified yet, indicating a fresh start for identifying relevant code spans.\n3. From the search results, the following code spans seem relevant:\n   - 'Basic.subs' in 'sympy/core/basic.py': This method is responsible for substituting variables in expressions and aligns with the reported issue.\n   - 'Basic._subs' in 'sympy/core/basic.py': This method is a helper for the 'subs' method and might contain specific handling for substitutions.\n   - 'limit' in 'sympy/series/limits.py': This function and related 'Limit' class handle limits, which are relevant for dealing with undefined expressions.\n   - 'Integral' and its methods in 'sympy/integrals/integrals.py': Although not directly involved in the 'subs' issue, these relate to mathematical operations and might have indirect relevance.\n   - '_invert' and 'domain_check' in 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py': These functions might relate to the solving of equations that could be relevant if the issue involves solving for undefined expressions.\n\nBased on the analysis, it appears that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue concerning substitutions leading to undefined expressions in SymPy. The 'Basic.subs' and '_subs' methods deal directly with substitutions, while 'limit' and 'Limit' handle undefined expressions by computing limits. The other functions such as 'Integral' and '_invert' seem peripherally relevant to the issue in a mathematical computation context.\n\nThe identified code spans align with the key elements of the reported issue, such as handling substitutions and computing limits to manage undefined expressions. This indicates that the search task is likely complete, as the relevant parts of the codebase appear to be covered.",
