The user is looking for a way to handle such cases, possibly by calculating the limit when such substitutions lead to undefined expressions. The relevant code span identified is the `subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py`, which contains the logic for performing substitutions.

This includes looking into the 'Expr' class in 'sympy/core/expr.py', the 'Mul' and 'Add' classes in 'sympy/core/mul.py' and 'sympy/core/add.py', and the 'transform' method in 'sympy/integrals/integrals.py'.

Analyzed the reported issue to understand the context and specifics (e.g., the expression `r` is undefined when `b` is substituted by `a`).\n\n2. Reviewed the current file context to understand the scope of the already identified files and code spans. Noticed that `sympy/core/basic.py` has a method `Basic.subs` which is likely relevant.\n\n3. Processed new search results:\n   a. Analyzed each code span in the provided `search_results` to match them with the key elements, functions, variables, or patterns identified in the reported issue.\n   b. Identified the critical method `Mul._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/mul.py` and `Add._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/add.py` as potential places where substitutions for multiplication and addition operations might be handled, which are crucial since `r` involves both types of operations.\n   c. Noted the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, as it might be involved in handling cases where a substitution leads to an undefined expression and a limit needs to be calculated.\n\n4. Evaluated the relevance of each code span based on how well it aligns with the reported issue and current file context. For instance, `Mul._eval_subs` and `Add._eval_subs` both handle substitution within the context of their respective operations, which is directly related to the operations in the expression `r`. The `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` handles calculating limits, which is a key aspect of the reported issue when an expression becomes undefined.\n\nGiven these analyses, I have identified relevant code spans that address the reported issue, including methods related to substitution handling in multiplication, addition, and the management of limits when expressions become undefined.",
