The key part of the issue is the `subs` method, which is used to substitute variables in mathematical expressions. The focus should be on the `subs` method and its internal workings, especially how it handles cases where the substitution results in an undefined expression.\n\nIn the provided search results, two files are relevant: `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/mul.py`. Both files contain implementations of the `subs` method and its helper function `_eval_subs`, which are critical for understanding and resolving the issue.\n\n1. **sympy/core/basic.py**: This file contains the `Basic` class, from which many other SymPy classes inherit. The `subs` method is defined here and handles substitution for both ordered and unordered sequences. It also manages simultaneous substitutions and calls `_subs` for each substitution.\n\n2. **sympy/core/mul.py**: This file contains the `Mul` class, which implements multiplication in SymPy. The `_eval_subs` method for the `Mul` class is defined here, which is called by the `subs` method in `Basic`. This method handles more complex cases of substitution, especially for multiplication operations.\n\nGiven the context of the issue, the relevant code spans are those that directly implement or support the `subs` method, as they are most likely to contain the logic that leads to undefined expressions under certain substitutions. These spans are identified in the analysis below.\n\n",

The subs method manages the substitution process, including simultaneous substitutions and handling of dictionaries. The _eval_subs method is a placeholder for subclasses to implement specific substitution logic. In sympy/core/mul.py, the Mul class contains a detailed _eval_subs method tailored for handling substitutions within multiplication expressions, including special cases for numbers and non-commutative terms.
