The relevant areas to investigate are the `_eval_subs` method in classes like `Mul`, `Add`, `Basic`, and `Expr`, as well as the `subs` method in `Basic` and possibly the `limit` method in `Expr`. Additionally, the `_combine_inverse` method in `Mul` and `Add` might also be relevant since it handles the combination of inverses, which could be related to the undefined behavior encountered. The `limit` method and its heuristics could also be checked, especially if the issue sometimes requires calculating the limit instead of performing substitution directly.",
