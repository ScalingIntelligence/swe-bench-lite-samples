From the issue, it is clear that the problem occurs when 'b' is substituted by 'a', making the expression undefined. The 'subs' method is likely implemented in one of the core files of SymPy. Additionally, since limits are mentioned as a workaround, the 'limit' function might also be relevant for understanding the issue. To start, we should focus on the core files related to expression substitution and limit calculations. We should also consider any additional utilities or helper functions that might handle expressions and substitutions within SymPy.",

Specifically, the user is dealing with an expression 'r' and substitutes 'b' with 'a', which makes 'r' undefined. The goal is to identify the relevant code spans that handle substitutions and how they might lead to undefined expressions. Upon analyzing the provided search results, several relevant code spans are identified: 1. 'Basic.subs': This method handles the substitution of expressions in 'Basic' objects, which includes expressions like 'r'. 2. 'Basic._subs': This is a cached method that performs further evaluation and substitution. 3. 'Expr.limit': Although not directly about substitution, it relates to handling undefined expressions using limits, which is an alternative approach the user suggests. 4. 'limit' function in 'limits.py': This function calculates the limit of expressions, which can be used to handle cases where expressions become undefined due to substitutions. These code spans are relevant because they either directly handle the substitution mechanism ('subs', '_subs') or provide ways to handle the undefined expressions ('limit' and 'Expr.limit'). Together, they offer a comprehensive view of how substitution and undefined expressions are managed in the codebase, aligning well with the reported issue.",

For\n               example, after Add's _eval_subs removes some matching terms\n               it must process the remaining terms so it calls _subs\n               on each of the un-matched terms and then adds them\n               onto the terms previously obtained.\n\n           3) If the initial expression should remain unchanged then\n              the original expression should be returned. (Whenever an\n              expression is returned, modified or not, no further\n              substitution of old -> new is attempted.)
