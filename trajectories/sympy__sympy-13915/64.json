The primary concern is that substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))` leads to an undefined result, even though the limit as 'b' approaches 'a' is defined and can be calculated. This indicates issues in the substitution logic or handling of undefined expressions. Key files to investigate include those related to core operations like multiplication, addition, power, and basic substitution handling. Additionally, the limit handling classes and functions will be crucial for verifying the correctness of the limit calculation as compared to the substitution.",

To resolve this issue, we need to look for the core functionality handling substitutions and checks for undefined expressions. In the provided search results, we found relevant code spans from several files. The 'Basic.subs' and 'Basic._subs' methods manage general substitution in the 'basic.py' file, while the 'Subs.__new__' method in 'function.py' handles substitution in a more specialized manner. Additionally, the 'limit' and 'Limit' methods in 'limits.py' are relevant for handling limits, especially when substitutions lead to undefined expressions.
