This could be due to the implementation of the `subs` method in SymPy. Since the example provided involves `sympy.core.expr.Expr.limit` as a workaround, it's likely that the issue is within the `subs` method or related to how expressions handle substitutions. Therefore, the search should focus on the `subs` method implementations in classes like `Basic`, `Expr`, and others that might handle substitutions.",
