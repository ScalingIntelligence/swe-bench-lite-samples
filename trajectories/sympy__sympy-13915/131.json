The user identified that substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r` results in an undefined expression, but the limit can be calculated using `r.limit(b,a)`. This indicates a potential issue with the `subs` method which should handle such substitutions more gracefully or provide appropriate feedback when the substitution leads to an undefined expression. The search results provided include various methods and classes from SymPy's core modules that are likely relevant to addressing this issue. Specifically, the `Basic.subs`, `Basic._subs`, and `Basic._eval_subs` methods are directly related to substitution operations and could be inspected or modified to handle undefined cases better. The `limit` and `Limit` from `sympy.series.limits` are also relevant, as the user suggests using limits to handle such cases. Additionally, the `Pow._eval_subs`, `Mul._eval_subs`, `Add._eval_subs`, and `Expr.simplify` are also potentially relevant as they deal with substitution and simplification of mathematical expressions where undefined results can occur. It's important to carefully review these methods to determine if they need to be adjusted to handle the specific case of substitutions leading to undefined expressions and to consider implementing additional checks or raising meaningful exceptions where appropriate.",

The core/power.py, core/mul.py, and core/add.py files also contain methods (`_eval_subs` in particular) that handle various aspects of substitutions within expressions of different types (Power, Mul, Add). The core/expr.py file includes the `simplify` method, which might be indirectly relevant for handling complex substitutions.
