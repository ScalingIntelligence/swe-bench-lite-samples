The `subs` method from SymPy's `Basic` class seems to be involved, as well as potentially the `_eval_subs` methods in various classes like `Mul`, `Add`, `Expr`, and `Basic`. Also, the `limit` method defined in `expr.py` could be relevant for handling undefined expressions by calculating limits when substitutions lead to undefined results. Looking into these specific methods and classes should help identify the root cause and potential fixes.",
