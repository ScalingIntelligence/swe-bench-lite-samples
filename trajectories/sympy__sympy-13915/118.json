This problem might be addressed in the core functionality or utility functions related to expression manipulation, specifically in the _eval_subs method or similar parts dealing with substitution. Looking at the provided context, there are several files where the _eval_subs method is defined or used, which might directly impact how substitutions are handled. Additionally, since the problem can also be approached by calculating a limit when a substitution leads to an undefined expression, files and functions related to limit calculations, such as the limit method in sympy/core/expr.py, might also be relevant. Furthermore, the sympy/solvers/solveset.py file with the substitution function could potentially handle scenarios where expressions become undefined. Therefore, the search should focus on these specific functionalities in the identified file paths.",

Additionally, the `substitution` function in `sympy.solvers.solveset` is relevant as it deals with symbol substitution in system equations. The `Limit` class in `sympy.series.limits` is also pertinent as it handles the calculation of limits, which can be used to handle cases where a substitution leads to an undefined expression. Furthermore, the `Subs` class in `sympy.core.function` manages symbolic substitutions. The provided search results do not directly contain additional relevant code spans beyond those already identified in the file context.

Specifically, substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))` results in an undefined expression. The user is able to calculate the limit using `r.limit(b, a)` but is seeking a solution to handle such cases within the `subs` method. The analysis of the provided code reveals relevant code spans within the `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` files, specifically focusing on the `Basic.subs` and `Expr._eval_interval` methods. These methods handle the substitution and interval evaluation respectively, which are critical for addressing the issue. Additionally, the `Limit` class in `sympy/series/limits.py` is also relevant as it handles the calculation of limits, which is a workaround the user mentioned.",
