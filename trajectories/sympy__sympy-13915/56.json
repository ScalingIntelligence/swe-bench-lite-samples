The user is looking for a way to handle such cases, potentially by calculating limits to determine the behavior when a subexpression becomes undefined. The search results include several relevant code spans from the SymPy library, particularly focusing on the `subs` method and its evaluation in various contexts. The `Basic.subs` and `Basic._eval_subs` methods are particularly pertinent, as they handle the substitution logic. Additionally, the `Limit` class in `sympy/series/limits.py` is relevant for understanding how SymPy handles limits, which might be a solution for the user's issue. Other classes like `Derivative`, `Subs`, and various arithmetic operations' `_eval_subs` methods also provide context for how substitutions are managed in different mathematical contexts within SymPy. The analysis of these code spans suggests that they are indeed relevant to the reported issue, as they directly address how substitutions are made and evaluated in mathematical expressions, and how limits can be used to handle cases of undefined subexpressions.",
