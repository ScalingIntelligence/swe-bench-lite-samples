The primary focus should be on understanding how the `subs` method handles cases where the substitution leads to undefined expressions. Key files to investigate include those related to the `subs` method and limit calculations, such as `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/expr.py`, and `sympy/series/limits.py`. Additionally, examining how `Mul`, `Add`, and `Pow` classes handle substitutions (`sympy/core/mul.py`, `sympy/core/add.py`, `sympy/core/power.py`) could provide insights into the underlying issue. Also, the `Limit` class in `sympy/series/limits.py` should be investigated to understand how limits handle undefined expressions differently from substitutions.",

The user provides an example using the sympy library, and it's noted that substituting 'b' by 'a' in the expression makes it undefined, while calculating the limit provides a defined result. To address this, it's important to examine the code related to substitution and limit evaluation in sympy. The provided search results contain several files and spans of code from sympy, such as 'sympy/core/basic.py', 'sympy/series/limits.py', 'sympy/core/expr.py', 'sympy/core/mul.py', 'sympy/core/add.py', and 'sympy/core/power.py', which include methods like 'subs', 'limit', and related utility functions. These are directly relevant to the issue's focus on substituting variables and handling undefined expressions mathematically. For instance, the 'Basic.subs' and 'Basic._subs' methods in 'sympy/core/basic.py' are related to substitutions. Similarly, the 'Limit' class and its methods in 'sympy/series/limits.py' are relevant for evaluating limits. Given the nature of the issue, these code spans are identified as relevant to understanding and potentially resolving the problem related to substitutions leading to undefined expressions in sympy.",
