The reported example is `r.subs(b,a)` where `r` is defined as `(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`. The goal is to identify relevant code spans in the provided search results that are related to the `subs` method and handling of undefined expressions or substitutions.\n\n1. Analyzing the issue, the key focus is on the `subs` method, which is used to substitute variables in expressions. The issue specifically occurs when substituting `b` with `a`, leading to an undefined expression.\n2. The current file context shows several implementations of the `subs` method across different classes such as `Basic`, `ExprWithLimits`, `Application`, `Derivative`, `Subs`, `exp`, `Mul`, `Pow`, `Add`, `Piecewise`, and `PolyElement`.\n3. In the new search results, the `subs` method is found in `Mul`, `Pow`, `Basic`, `exp`, `Expr`, `Derivative`, `Add`, and `Piecewise`. Each of these implementations handles substitutions in slightly different ways, particularly in handling different types of expressions and conditions.\n4. The `Pow._eval_subs` method, for example, handles substitutions differently depending on whether `old` is a `Pow` and whether `self.exp` and `old.exp` match. It also deals with substitutions in the exponent.\n5. The `Piecewise._eval_subs` method handles substitutions for each condition in the piecewise function, ensuring that substitutions are made only for conditions that are not False.\n\nGiven the complexity and diversity of how substitutions are handled across different classes, identifying specific spans that directly relate to the issue of substituting `b` with `a` leading to an undefined expression is challenging. The core logic relevant to the issue is likely spread across multiple methods and classes, and a comprehensive review of the substitution logic in each context would be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause and relevant code spans.",

The current file context includes implementations of `subs` and `_eval_subs` methods in various SymPy modules such as `Basic`, `Expr`, `Mul`, `Add`, `Pow`, `Derivative`, and `Piecewise`. The search results provide additional implementations of `_eval_subs` in these same modules, suggesting that the relevant code spans likely involve these methods across different modules. The task is to identify which of these methods or their implementations within the code spans are most relevant to the issue of substitution leading to undefined expressions.",
