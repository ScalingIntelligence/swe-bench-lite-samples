To address this, we need to investigate the code responsible for handling substitutions and expressions in SymPy. The relevant classes and methods to look into include `Mul`, `Basic`, `Expr`, `Integral`, `Subs`, `Add`, and `Pow`, focusing specifically on their `_eval_subs` methods. Additionally, functions like `_smart_subs` and `substitution` are also relevant for understanding substitution logic. The goal is to identify where the substitution logic fails when a subexpression becomes undefined.",

The issue described involves a substitution that leads to an undefined expression, specifically when 'b' is substituted by 'a'. The code spans provided include methods and classes related to substitution, such as '_eval_subs' in various classes like 'Pow', 'Mul', 'Subs', and 'exp'. We should examine these methods to understand how substitutions are handled in each class. Additionally, we should look for any checks or conditions that might prevent or handle undefined expressions during substitutions. The provided search results contain detailed implementations of '_eval_subs' in different contexts, which will help in understanding the broader handling of substitutions within SymPy. Given the context and the reported issue, the '_eval_subs' methods in 'Pow', 'Mul', and 'Subs' are particularly relevant since they directly deal with substitutions and can potentially cause undefined expressions. These methods should be carefully reviewed to identify any conditions or checks that might prevent undefined expressions. Furthermore, the '_smart_subs' function in 'sympy/physics/mechanics/functions.py' might also be relevant as it appears to handle substitutions differently, possibly avoiding undefined expressions.",
