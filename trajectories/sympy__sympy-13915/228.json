It specifically mentions a substitution where b is replaced by a, making the expression undefined. The user also suggests calculating the limit as an alternative. I need to identify the relevant code spans dealing with substitutions and limits in the given search results.\n\nFrom the provided files and code spans, I see that multiple files contain methods related to substitution (`_eval_subs`, `subs`, `xreplace`) and limiting (`compute_leading_term`, `limit`). These methods are spread across various classes like Basic, Expr, Pow, Mul, Add, Derivative, and Subs.\n\nI will analyze each code span to determine if it deals with substitution or limiting behavior as described in the issue. I will focus on the methods that specifically handle substitutions and how they handle cases where the substitution leads to undefined expressions or how they can be modified to address such cases. Additionally, I will look for methods that deal with limits, particularly how they are calculated in the context of approaching an undefined point.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, I expect to find relevant code in the `subs` method of the Basic class, the `_eval_subs` methods in various classes like Pow, Mul, and Add, and possibly the methods dealing with limits in the Expr class. By examining these, I should be able to identify the code spans that are directly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

These methods are designed to manage expressions, including the detection of cases where substitutions might lead to undefined expressions (e.g., division by zero). Additionally, the `Pow` class specifically contains logic for handling substitutions in exponents and bases. Despite these comprehensive methods, they do not explicitly handle the scenario where substituting 'b' with 'a' leads to an undefined expression within the specific example provided (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b)).

The provided file context includes implementations for 'subs' and '_eval_subs' in `Basic`, `Add`, `Mul`, and `Pow` classes, all crucial for substitution logic. Moreover, the `_combine_inverse` method in `Add` and `Mul` classes suggests these deal with combining and manipulating expressions, potentially relevant to handling undefined states post-substitution. The `limit` method in `Expr` also indicates capabilities for evaluating limits, which might be necessary for handling the undefined scenario as per the issue's suggestion to use 'limit' for calculation. Given the depth and integration of these methods across key classes, the file context effectively covers the areas that would require modifications or introspection to address the issue. It encompasses the central logic for expression substitution and combination without directly suggesting changes, which aligns with the requirement to only identify relevant code.",
