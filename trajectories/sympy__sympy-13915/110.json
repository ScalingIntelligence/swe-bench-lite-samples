The key functionality to investigate is the `subs` method and its internal handling, particularly the `_eval_subs` method. The search results provide several relevant code spans that handle substitution logic in different parts of SymPy: \n1. In `sympy/core/mul.py`, `Mul._eval_subs` and its helper methods are found. This is relevant because the issue involves a complex expression with multiplication (1/(a+b) and 1/(a-b)).\n2. In `sympy/core/basic.py`, `Basic.subs` and `Basic._subs` are relevant as they define the higher-level substitution logic that would be inherited by other classes like `Expr`. The `Basic._eval_subs` method is also found, which is the fallback for classes without their own `_eval_subs` implementation.\n3. In `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Subs` class and its `_eval_subs` method are relevant if the substitution involves function expressions or if the problem relates to multivariate substitution handling.\n4. In `sympy/core/add.py`, `Add._eval_subs` is found, which is relevant because the problem involves addition in the given expression (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b)).\nGiven the nature of the issue, all these code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing the problem with substitutions leading to undefined expressions.",

The implementation of 'subs' in each class is thorough and indicates that if there are any edge cases like substituting a variable with another that makes an expression undefined, these classes are equipped to handle such scenarios, potentially using other methods like 'limit' for proper evaluation.
