The focus should be on the `subs` method and its related functionalities within the SymPy library. The relevant files identified so far, such as `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/mul.py`, already contain essential code related to `subs`. Additionally, the `sympy/series/limits.py` file may be relevant due to its handling of limits, which is another approach to dealing with undefined expressions. Further exploration in these areas may help uncover the exact cause of the undefined expression issue.",

The user provides an example where substituting `b` with `a` in an expression `r` causes a division by zero. The user also notes that calculating the limit with `r.limit(b, a)` returns the correct result, indicating a need for better handling of such substitutions.\n\nThe search results include multiple files from the SymPy codebase that deal with substitution handling. Relevant spans of code are found in files like `sympy/core/mul.py`, `sympy/core/basic.py`, and others, where methods such as `_eval_subs` and `subs` are defined. These methods are crucial for the substitution logic in the library.\n\nBy examining these spans, we can identify the parts of the codebase that are directly involved in handling substitutions. Key methods to focus on include `_eval_subs` in `Mul`, `Basic`, `Pow`, and other classes, as they contain logic for replacing expressions and handling specific edge cases like dividing by zero.

It checks for conditions under which a substitution can be made and handles cases where the result might be undefined.\n\n3. In 'sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py', the 'Piecewise' class's '_eval_subs' method manages substitutions within piecewise defined functions.
