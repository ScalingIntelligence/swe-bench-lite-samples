To address this, we need to look for code related to substitution (subs) and handling undefined expressions or limits in the SymPy codebase. The provided search results indicate several relevant files and spans: 'sympy/core/basic.py' contains the 'subs' method within the 'Basic' class, suggesting it's a core function for substitution. 'sympy/series/limits.py' includes the 'limit' function, which could be pertinent for handling undefined expressions by calculating limits. Moreover, 'sympy/core/expr.py' and 'sympy/calculus/util.py' also contain methods related to 'limit', indicating how SymPy might manage such cases. Additionally, 'sympy/core/add.py' and 'sympy/core/mul.py' include '_eval_subs' methods for 'Add' and 'Mul' classes, which would be crucial for understanding how expressions are manipulated during substitution. Based on this analysis, the provided search results sufficiently cover the necessary code spans related to substitution and handling undefined expressions in SymPy. This includes the core substitution functionality, methods for evaluating substitutions specifically in add and multiply operations, and functions for managing limits in series and calculus modules.",

This involves understanding how the subs method works in SymPy, particularly when the substitution can cause the expression to become undefined. The user has provided a specific example where substituting b with a in the expression r makes it undefined, and they are looking for ways to calculate the limit instead.\n\nThe current file context already contains three key files: `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/series/limits.py`, and `sympy/core/expr.py`, which are relevant to the subs method, limit calculations, and expression handling in SymPy. The provided search results include additional files and code spans that are pertinent to this issue, such as `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/core/power.py`, which contain methods related to function and power substitutions.\n\nTo determine the relevance of each code span, I will examine whether the code spans address the handling of substitutions, particularly those that could lead to undefined expressions, and how limit calculations are implemented or referenced in the code. I will also look for any overlapping functionality with the already identified code spans to avoid redundancy.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will compile a list of relevant files and span IDs, ensuring that the identified spans indeed contribute to solving the reported issue.",
