The user observes that substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r` results in an undefined expression, despite the possibility of calculating the limit. The key elements to focus on are the methods related to substitution (specifically `subs` and `_eval_subs`) and potentially the handling of limits. The search results contain relevant code spans from `Basic.subs`, `Basic._eval_subs`, `Mul._eval_subs`, and `Pow._eval_subs`, which are directly involved in the substitution process and could be where the issue arises. Additionally, the `Expr.limit` method might also be relevant for understanding how limits are handled during substitution failures. By examining these methods, we can gain insight into how substitutions are implemented and why they might lead to undefined expressions.",
