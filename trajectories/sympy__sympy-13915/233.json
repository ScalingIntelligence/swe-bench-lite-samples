The\n               resulting sorted list is then processed as an iterable container\n               (see previous).\n\n        If the keyword ``simultaneous`` is True, the subexpressions will not be\n        evaluated until all the substitutions have been made.\n\n        Examples\n        ========\n\n        >>> from sympy import pi, exp, limit, oo\n        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n        >>> (1 + x*y).subs(x, pi)\n        pi*y + 1\n        >>> (1 + x*y).subs({x:pi, y:2})\n        1 + 2*pi\n        >>> (1 + x*y).subs([(x, pi), (y, 2)])\n        1 + 2*pi\n        >>> reps = [(y, x**2), (x, 2)]\n        >>> (x + y).subs(reps)\n        6\n        >>> (x + y).subs(reversed(reps))\n        x**2 + 2\n\n        >>> (x**2 + x**4).subs(x**2, y)\n        y**2 + y\n\n        To replace only the x**2 but not the x**4, use xreplace:\n\n        >>> (x**2 + x**4).xreplace({x**2: y})\n        x**4 + y\n\n        To delay evaluation until all substitutions have been made,\n        set the keyword ``simultaneous`` to True:\n\n        >>> (x/y).subs([(x, 0), (y, 0)])\n        0\n        >>> (x/y).subs([(x, 0), (y, 0)], simultaneous=True)\n        nan\n\n        This has the added feature of not allowing subsequent substitutions\n        to affect those already made:\n\n        >>> ((x + y)/y).subs({x + y: y, y: x + y})\n        1\n        >>> ((x + y)/y).subs({x + y: y, y: x + y}, simultaneous=True)\n        y/(x + y)\n\n        In order to obtain a canonical result, unordered iterables are\n        sorted by count_op length, number of arguments and by the\n        default_sort_key to break any ties. All other iterables are left\n        unsorted.\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, sin, cos\n        >>> from sympy.abc import a, b, c, d, e\n\n        >>> A = (sqrt(sin(2*x)), a)\n        >>> B = (sin(2*x), b)\n        >>> C = (cos(2*x), c)\n        >>> D = (x, d)\n        >>> E = (exp(x), e)\n\n        >>> expr = sqrt(sin(2*x))*sin(exp(x)*x)*cos(2*x) + sin(2*x)\n\n        >>> expr.subs(dict([A, B, C, D, E]))\n        a*c*sin(d*e) + b\n\n        The resulting expression represents a literal replacement of the\n        old arguments with the new arguments. This may not reflect the\n        limiting behavior of the expression:\n\n        >>> (x**3 - 3*x).subs({x: oo})\n        nan\n\n        >>> limit(x**3 - 3*x, x, oo)\n        oo\n\n        If the substitution will be followed by numerical\n        evaluation, it is better to pass the substitution to\n        evalf as\n\n        >>> (1/x).evalf(subs={x: 3.0}, n=21)\n        0.333333333333333333333\n\n        rather than\n\n        >>> (1/x).subs({x: 3.0}).evalf(21)\n        0.333333333333333314830\n\n        as the former will ensure that the desired level of precision is\n        obtained.\n\n        See Also\n        ========\n        replace: replacement capable of doing wildcard-like matching,\n                 parsing of match, and conditional replacements\n        xreplace: exact node replacement in expr tree; also capable of\n                  using matching rules\n        evalf: calculates the given formula to a desired level of precision\n\n        \"\"\"\n        from sympy.core.containers import Dict\n        from sympy.utilities import default_sort_key\n        from sympy import Dummy, Symbol\n\n        unordered = False\n        if len(args) == 1:\n            sequence = args[0]\n            if isinstance(sequence, set):\n                unordered = True\n            elif isinstance(sequence, (Dict, Mapping)):\n                unordered = True\n                sequence = sequence.items()\n            elif not iterable(sequence):\n                from sympy.utilities.misc import filldedent\n                raise ValueError(filldedent(\"\"\"\n                   When a single argument is passed to subs\n                   it should be a dictionary of old: new pairs or an iterable\n                   of (old, new) tuples.\"\"\"))\n        elif len(args) == 2:\n            sequence = [args]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"subs accepts either 1 or 2 arguments\")\n\n        sequence = list(sequence)\n        for i in range(len(sequence)):\n            s = list(sequence[i])\n            for j, si in enumerate(s):\n                try:\n                    si = sympify(si, strict=True)\n                except SympifyError:\n                    if type(si) is str:\n                        si = Symbol(si)\n                    else:\n                        # if it can't be sympified, skip it\n                        sequence[i] = None\n                        break\n                s[j] = si\n            else:\n                sequence[i] = None if _aresame(*s) else tuple(s)\n        sequence = list(filter(None, sequence))\n\n        if unordered:\n            sequence = dict(sequence)\n            if not all(k.is_Atom for k in sequence):\n                d = {}\n                for o, n in sequence.items():\n                    try:\n                        ops = o.count_ops(), len(o.args)\n                    except TypeError:\n                        ops = (0, 0)\n                    d.setdefault(ops, []).append((o, n))\n                newseq = []\n                for k in sorted(d.keys(), reverse=True):\n                    newseq.extend(\n                        sorted([v[0] for v in d[k]], key=default_sort_key))\n                sequence = [(k, sequence[k]) for k in newseq]\n                del newseq, d\n            else:\n                sequence = sorted([(k, v) for (k, v) in sequence.items()],\n                                  key=default_sort_key)\n\n        if kwargs.pop('simultaneous', False):  # XXX should this be the default for dict subs?\n            reps = {}\n            rv = self\n            kwargs['hack2'] = True\n            m = Dummy()\n            for old, new in sequence:\n                d = Dummy(commutative=new.is_commutative)\n                # using d*m so Subs will be used on dummy variables\n                # in things like Derivative(f(x, y), x) in which x\n                # is both free and bound\n                rv = rv._subs(old, d*m, **kwargs)\n                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):\n                    break\n                reps[d] = new\n            reps[m] = S.One  # get rid of m\n            return rv.xreplace(reps)\n        else:\n            rv = self\n            for old, new in sequence:\n                rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)\n                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):\n                    break\n                if rv.is_undefined:\n                    try:\n                    try:\n                        rv = self.limit(old, new)\n                    except (PoleError, NotImplementedError):\n                        pass\n            return rv\n```.\n\nMake sure that you return the unchanged code in the replace tag exactly as it is.
