The provided code snippet shows that substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r` results in an undefined expression. The relevant files identified so far suggest that the issue might be related to the substitution method in SymPy, specifically in the core modules like `basic.py`, `expr.py`, and `function.py`. Additionally, the `limit` method in `series/limits.py` might also be relevant for understanding the behavior when an expression becomes undefined. Therefore, the search should focus on these specific areas, including the `subs` and `limit` methods.",

The `_subs` method is responsible for performing substitutions in SymPy expressions, which is where the undefined behavior arises when substituting `b` with `a` in the example. The `limit` function is used to handle cases where direct substitution leads to an undefined expression. The file context provided is sufficient to understand how SymPy handles these situations, making it likely that any fix or enhancement related to the issue would involve changes to these methods.

As rule\n        you can use string or a destination function instance (in\n        this case rewrite() will use the str() function).\n\n        There is also the possibility to pass hints on how to rewrite\n        the given expressions. For now there is only one such hint\n        defined called 'deep'. When 'deep' is set to False it will\n        forbid functions to rewrite their contents.\n\n        Examples\n        ========\n\n        >>> from sympy import sin, exp\n        >>> from sympy.abc import x\n\n        Unspecified pattern:\n\n        >>> sin(x).rewrite(exp)\n        -I*(exp(I*x) - exp(-I*x))/2\n\n        Pattern as a single function:\n\n        >>> sin(x).rewrite(sin, exp)\n        -I*(exp(I*x) - exp(-I*x))/2\n\n        Pattern as a list of functions:\n\n        >>> sin(x).rewrite([sin, ], exp)\n        -I*(exp(I*x) - exp(-I*x))/2\n\n        \"\"\"\n        if not args:\n            return self\n        else:\n            pattern = args[:-1]\n            if isinstance(args[-1], string_types):\n                rule = '_eval_rewrite_as_' + args[-1]\n            else:\n                try:\n                    rule = '_eval_rewrite_as_' + args[-1].__name__\n                except:\n                    rule = '_eval_rewrite_as_' + args[-1].__class__.__name__\n\n            if not pattern:\n                return self._eval_rewrite(None, rule, **hints)\n            else:\n                if iterable(pattern[0]):\n                    pattern = pattern[0]\n\n                pattern = [p for p in pattern if self.has(p)]\n\n                if pattern:\n                    return self._eval_rewrite(tuple(pattern), rule, **hints)\n                else:\n                    return self\n\n    _constructor_postprocessor_mapping = {}\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _exec_constructor_postprocessors(cls, obj):\n        # WARNING: This API is experimental.\n\n        # This is an experimental API that introduces constructor\n        # postprosessors for SymPy Core elements.
