The key to resolving this issue involves examining the substitution mechanism in the SymPy library. The initial search results focus on specific files and methods within the SymPy codebase that handle such substitutions. Specifically, sympy/core/mul.py contains the `Mul` class and its `_eval_subs` method, which is critical for understanding how substitutions are currently handled for multiplications. Similarly, sympy/core/basic.py has the `Basic` class with its `subs` method, which orchestrates the substitution process more broadly. Additionally, sympy/core/add.py features the `Add` class and its `_eval_subs` method, relevant for additions. Finally, sympy/core/expr.py includes the `Expr` class with its `limit` method, which is pertinent to handling undefined expressions by calculating limits. These sections of code are pivotal in understanding and potentially fixing the issue reported. They would benefit from a detailed review to ensure they handle edge cases like substitutions leading to undefined expressions appropriately.",

If the substitution results in division by zero, the method should return the result of the limit calculation.\n\nThe instructions require modifying the `_eval_subs` method to handle undefined expressions resulting from substitution. Specifically, if the substitution leads to division by zero, the method should return the result of the limit calculation. This logic should be implemented starting from the point where the substitution is considered and the division by zero condition needs to be checked. The lines to be modified are those related to checking and handling division by zero.",
