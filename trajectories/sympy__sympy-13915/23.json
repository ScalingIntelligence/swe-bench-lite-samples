The key functionalities to investigate are the 'subs' method for substitution and the handling of such cases where a subexpression becomes undefined. Relevant files include those related to core expression handling, such as 'sympy/core/basic.py', 'sympy/core/expr.py', and 'sympy/core/mul.py', which contain classes and methods for basic expression manipulation and substitution. Additionally, 'sympy/series/limits.py' appears relevant due to its role in handling limits, which are used to manage undefined expressions. These files should be inspected for how they manage and evaluate substitutions and limits.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a substitution that leads to an undefined expression within the sympy library. The user provides an example where substituting `b` with `a` in an expression `r` makes `r` undefined. The user also mentions that calculating the limit of `r` as `b` approaches `a` provides a defined result, but if any subexpression of `r` is undefined, `r` itself becomes undefined. The relevant code spans should help address how sympy handles substitutions and limits, particularly in cases where substitutions lead to undefined expressions.\n\nGiven the search results, the following code spans appear relevant:\n\n1. In `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `Basic.subs` and `Basic._subs` methods handle substitutions, including the substitution of symbols. This could be particularly relevant as it directly addresses substitution operations.\n\n2. In `sympy/series/limits.py`, the `Limit` class and its methods like `__new__`, `doit`, and others manage limit calculations. This is crucial as the issue might also require handling or altering the way limits are evaluated to ensure expressions are not incorrectly marked as undefined.\n\n3. The `Lambda` class in `sympy/core/function.py` and its methods could potentially be related if sympy uses lambda expressions in substitutions or limit evaluations, though the direct relevance is less clear.\n\nThese code spans should provide good starting points for addressing the issue, including handling substitutions more robustly and ensuring that limits are correctly evaluated to avoid marking expressions as undefined when they could be handled mathematically.\n\n",
