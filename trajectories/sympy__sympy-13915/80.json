The main code spans to focus on include those related to the _eval_subs methods in various classes such as Basic, Add, Application, Derivative, Subs, Mul, and Pow. These spans suggest that various classes that can be substituted handle the substitution logic in potentially different ways. Notably, the issue involves checking for undefined expressions after substitutions, which might require handling at the point where the substitution can turn a term to zero, causing the expression to be undefined. Thus, I will pinpoint the relevant parts concerning this specific oversight where substitution might be naively applied without considering the denominator suddenly turning to zero and causing an undefined expression.",
