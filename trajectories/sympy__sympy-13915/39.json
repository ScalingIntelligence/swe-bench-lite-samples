Given the context, it is likely related to how substitutions are handled in expressions, particularly when dealing with division where denominators might become zero. Key files to investigate include those related to core expression handling, substitution, and limit calculations. Specific classes such as 'Expr', 'Basic', 'Mul', 'Add', and functions like 'subs', 'limit', and '_eval_subs' should be focused on.",
