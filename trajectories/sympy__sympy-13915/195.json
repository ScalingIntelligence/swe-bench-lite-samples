Specifically, substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))` results in an undefined expression. The issue suggests that when a subexpression of `r` is undefined, `r` itself becomes undefined. The task is to identify relevant code spans from the search results that deal with handling substitutions and undefined expressions in SymPy.\n\nFrom the search results, several code spans are relevant:\n1. `sympy/core/function.py` - The `Subs` class and its methods, particularly `__new__`, deal with substitutions and handling of undefined expressions.\n2. `sympy/series/limits.py` - The `Limit` class and its methods, particularly `__new__`, deal with defining and handling limits, which is relevant when expressions become undefined.\n3. `sympy/integrals/manualintegrate.py` - The `find_substitutions` function is relevant as it deals with substitutions in integrals, which is a more general context but still relevant to substitutions.\n\nThese code spans are chosen because they directly address the handling of substitutions and undefined expressions, which are central to the reported issue.",

The user is looking for the relevant code spans that handle substitutions and deal with potentially undefined results in SymPy.\n\nThe current file context includes code spans from sympy/core/function.py, particularly focusing on the Derivative and Subs classes. These classes handle the differentiation and substitution of expressions respectively. The Derivative class includes methods like __new__ and _eval_subs, while the Subs class has methods like __new__, __hash__, and several properties like variables and expr.\n\nThe new search results include code spans from sympy/core/basic.py and sympy/core/function.py. In the Basic class from sympy/core/basic.py, there are methods like subs, _subs, and _eval_subs, which are relevant for handling substitutions in expressions. In sympy/core/function.py, the Subs class has additional methods like doit, evalf, and properties like expr_free_symbols, which are relevant for evaluating substitutions and handling the expressions involved.\n\nBased on the issue and the current context, the relevant code spans to identify for handling substitutions and managing undefined results are from the Basic class in sympy/core/basic.py and the Subs class in sympy/core/function.py.",

The specific expression is r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b)), and the issue arises when substituting b with a. The current context provided shows relevant files and spans in the SymPy codebase that deal with derivatives and substitutions. To ascertain the relevance of the new search results, I examined each code span in detail. The spans involving 'Basic.subs', 'Derivative._eval_subs', and 'Subs.__new__' in the function.py file are directly related to the substitution functionalities, which are central to the reported issue. Additionally, 'find_substitutions' in manualintegrate.py and 'Limit.doit' in limits.py are relevant as they deal with finding substitutions and evaluating limits, which are related to handling undefined expressions. Therefore, these spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue of handling undefined expressions during substitutions.",

The provided file context includes SymPy's `Derivative` and `Subs` classes, which are relevant for dealing with differentiation and substitutions. Additionally, there's a reference to `sympy/series/limits.py` which contains the `Limit` class, crucial for evaluating limits when expressions become undefined. The `Derivative` class includes a `_eval_subs` method for substitutions, and the `Subs` class handles substitutions at points. While the specific logic to handle undefined expressions during substitutions is not directly evident in the provided code (possibly in `_eval_subs` methods or elsewhere), the structure and methods hint at where such logic should be implemented or extended to address the issue effectively. Given the breadth of SymPy and the issue's complexity, it's plausible that there might be additional relevant code and methods across other files that would need to be examined or implemented. However, based on the provided context, it appears that the relevant bases for addressing the issue are present through the classes and methods discussed.",

One is also able to calculate derivatives of Subs objects - in\n    this case the expression is always expanded (for the unevaluated form, use\n    Derivative()).\n\n    A simple example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Subs, Function, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n    >>> f = Function('f')\n    >>> e = Subs(f(x).diff(x), x, y)\n    >>> e.subs(y, 0)\n    Subs(Derivative(f(x), x), (x,), (0,))\n    >>> e.subs(f, sin).doit()\n    cos(y)\n\n    An example with several variables:\n\n    >>> Subs(f(x)*sin(y) + z, (x, y), (0, 1))\n    Subs(z + f(x)*sin(y), (x, y), (0, 1))\n    >>> _.doit()\n    z + f(0)*sin(1)\n\n    \"\"\"\n    def __new__(cls, expr, variables, point, **assumptions):\n        from sympy import Symbol, Limit\n        if not is_sequence(variables, Tuple):\n            variables = [variables]\n        variables = list(sympify(variables))\n\n        if list(uniq(variables)) != variables:\n            repeated = [ v for v in set(variables) if variables.count(v) > 1 ]\n            raise ValueError('cannot substitute expressions %s more than '\n                             'once.' % repeated)\n\n        point = Tuple(*(point if is_sequence(point, Tuple) else [point]))\n\n        if len(point) != len(variables):\n            raise ValueError('Number of point values must be the same as '\n                             'the number of variables.')\n\n        expr = sympify(expr)\n\n        # use symbols with names equal to the point value (with preppended _)\n        # to give a variable-independent expression\n        pre = \"_\"\n        pts = sorted(set(point), key=default_sort_key)\n        from sympy.printing import StrPrinter\n        class CustomStrPrinter(StrPrinter):\n            def _print_Dummy(self, expr):\n                return str(expr) + str(expr.dummy_index)\n        def mystr(expr, **settings):\n            p = CustomStrPrinter(settings)\n            return p.doprint(expr)\n        while 1:\n            s_pts = {p: Symbol(pre + mystr(p)) for p in pts}\n            reps = [(v, s_pts[p])\n                for v, p in zip(variables, point)]\n            # if any underscore-preppended symbol is already a free symbol\n            # and is a variable with a different point value, then there\n            # is a clash, e.g. _0 clashes in Subs(_0 + _1, (_0, _1), (1, 0))\n            # because the new symbol that would be created is _1 but _1\n            # is already mapped to 0 so __0 and __1 are used for the new\n            # symbols\n            if any(r in expr.free_symbols and\n                   r in variables and\n                   Symbol(pre + mystr(point[variables.index(r)])) != r\n                   for _, r in reps):\n                pre += \"_\"\n                continue\n            break\n\n        obj = Expr.__new__(cls"
