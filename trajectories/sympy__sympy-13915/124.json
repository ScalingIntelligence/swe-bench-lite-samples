The key elements to consider are the behavior of the substitution function, particularly when substituting 'b' for 'a' in an expression 'r' defined as '(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))'. The issue highlights that the substitution results in an undefined expression but the limit can be calculated. This suggests that the core issue lies in the handling of substitutions that lead to division by zero or similarly undefined operations. From the provided search results, we need to focus on the '_eval_subs' methods across different classes such as 'Mul', 'Order', 'Basic', 'Subs', 'Add', and 'Pow', and other related methods that might catch or handle undefined substitutions. Additionally, we should look for any methods that might help in defining behavior for such cases, potentially adding new methods or modifying existing ones to handle the undefined scenarios gracefully as suggested in the issue. Notable spans include 'Mul._eval_subs', 'Basic._eval_subs', 'Subs._eval_subs', 'Order._eval_subs', and similarly named methods in other classes. These provide the necessary context and code implementation to understand how substitutions are currently handled and where improvements or new logic might be needed to address the reported issue. The spans also give insights into the overall architecture of SymPy's core functionalities, making it easier to decide where new code or modifications should be placed.",
