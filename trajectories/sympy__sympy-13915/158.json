The problem arises when `b` is substituted by `a`, which makes `r` undefined. The relevant parts of the code to investigate are those that handle substitution (`subs`) and potentially the handling of undefined expressions or limits. The `subs` method in `sympy.core.basic` and `sympy.core.expr` might be crucial, as well as the `limit` method in `sympy.series.limits`, which is used to handle the calculation of limits when the expression becomes undefined. The specific implementation of `subs` in classes like `Mul`, `Add`, and `Expr` should also be reviewed. Additionally, the `_eval_subs` methods in various classes might be relevant, as they handle the substitution logic internally. The example files and the version of sympy used in the issue are also noted.",

The provided search results include various files and code spans related to this functionality. Notably, the `sympy/core/basic.py` file contains the `Basic.subs` and `Basic._subs` methods, which are directly related to substitution operations. The `sympy/core/function.py` file also contains the `Derivative._eval_subs` and `Lambda._eval_subs` methods, which are relevant as they handle substitution within derivative and lambda expressions, respectively. Furthermore, the `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` file has the `exp._eval_subs` method, which is crucial for substitution within exponential functions. Given these findings, it's clear that the relevant code spans are distributed across multiple files, each addressing different aspects of substitution within the `sympy` library. Therefore, the identified code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue and provide a comprehensive view of the substitution functionality within the library.",
