The user mentions that using 'r.limit(b, a)' calculates the limit correctly but expects 'r.subs(b, a)' to handle such cases. To address this, we need to identify the code responsible for the 'subs' method in SymPy and ensure it can handle or detect undefined sub-expressions. The search results provide different implementations of the 'subs' method across various SymPy files. We will focus on these implementations and determine if they correctly handle the substitution in the context of the reported issue. Specifically, we will look at 'sympy/core/basic.py' for the 'Basic.subs' method, 'sympy/core/function.py' for 'Application._eval_subs' and 'Derivative._eval_subs', 'sympy/core/power.py' for 'Pow._eval_subs', 'sympy/core/mul.py' for 'Mul._eval_subs', and 'sympy/core/add.py' for 'Add._eval_subs'.",

The error arises because `r` becomes undefined when `b` is substituted by `a`. To address this, it's crucial to delve deeper into how SymPy handles such substitutions and how it manages expressions becoming undefined. The provided context reveals methods like `_eval_subs` across different classes such as `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, and `Derivative`, which play a key role in handling substitutions. Additionally, exploring the handling of limits when expressions are undefined, as evidenced by the `limit` method in `Expr`, might provide necessary insights into managing these scenarios more effectively.",

This results in undefined expressions due to divisions by zero.

Further exploration in the codebase, especially around error handling and the management of special cases in substitutions, would be necessary to ensure complete relevant context is identified.
