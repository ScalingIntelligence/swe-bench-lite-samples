Specifically, the `subs` method in the `Basic` class and the `_eval_subs` method in various classes like `Mul`, `Add`, and `Pow` are likely to be relevant. Additionally, understanding how limits are handled in the `Expr` class and its subclasses will be essential to debug the undefined expression scenario.",

The user demonstrates an issue where substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression makes it undefined, suggesting a need for handling such cases with careful consideration of the substitution logic. The search results include multiple files from the SymPy codebase, notably 'sympy/core/basic.py' and 'sympy/core/function.py' which contain methods related to substitution and evaluation of expressions. The 'Basic.subs' method in 'sympy/core/basic.py' is a primary focus as it defines how substitutions are performed in SymPy expressions. This method includes logic for handling simultaneous substitutions and various edge cases, which could be relevant for addressing the reported issue. Additionally, the 'Subs' class in 'sympy/core/function.py' and related methods like 'doit' and 'expr' are also significant as they handle the evaluation of substitutions. Further, 'sympy/core/basic.py' also discusses the handling of unordered substitutions and the conversion of inputs to a format suitable for substitution. The 'Order._eval_subs' method in 'sympy/series/order.py' also deserves attention as it handles substitution in the context of order terms, which might be relevant for understanding the behavior of expressions under substitution. Given the nature of the issue reported, where a simple substitution leads to an expression becoming undefined, it is crucial to inspect code that directly influences or performs such substitutions.",
