The problem arises when substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, which should ideally return `-1` using limits but results in an undefined expression due to division by zero. The focus should be on the `subs` method and how it handles such cases, potentially including the `_eval_subs` method in relevant classes like `Basic`, `Expr`, `Mul`, `Add`, etc. Additionally, the `limit` method should also be considered as it is used to handle such undefined expressions gracefully. Given the provided files, the search should narrow down to relevant methods and classes in sympy/core and sympy/series directories.",

The code for handling substitutions, managing undefined expressions, and dealing with special cases like division by zero are present in these methods. Additionally, the `limit` function from `limits.py` could be relevant for handling cases where a substitution would lead to an undefined expression and a limit needs to be calculated instead. Overall, the provided file context appears to be comprehensive in addressing the issue related to substitutions leading to undefined expressions in SymPy, particularly when using the `subs` method with conditions that could lead to division by zero or similar undefined operations. The presence of the `extract_multiplicatively` and `limit` methods further supports the handling of such cases, suggesting that the file context is likely complete for addressing the reported issue.",
