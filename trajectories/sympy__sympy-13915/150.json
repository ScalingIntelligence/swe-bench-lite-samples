Relevant spans include the definitions of the subs method in Basic, the _eval_subs method in Basic and Order, and the _eval_subs method in Mul and Pow. These methods are crucial for understanding how substitutions are handled and how undefined expressions are managed. The code spans directly address the issue by detailing the logic of substitution and the evaluation of expressions post-substitution.
