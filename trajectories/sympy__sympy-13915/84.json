The user expects that the expression should handle such substitutions gracefully or provide a meaningful limit. The relevant code spans identified focus on the `subs` and `limit` methods in the SymPy library. These methods are crucial for handling substitutions and calculating limits, respectively. The `_eval_subs` method implementations in various classes such as `Basic`, `Expr`, `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, and `Derivative` are particularly relevant as they dictate how substitutions are evaluated. The `limit` method in the `Expr` class is also relevant as it provides the mechanism for calculating the limit of an expression when a substitution leads to an undefined result. Given the comprehensive nature of the identified code spans, they should provide enough context to understand and potentially resolve the issue regarding substitutions leading to undefined expressions.",
