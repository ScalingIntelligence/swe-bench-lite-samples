The methods `_eval_subs` in `sympy/core/mul.py`, `sympy/core/add.py`, and `sympy/core/power.py` also provide insights into how substitutions are handled for multiplication, addition, and power expressions, respectively. Additionally, `sympy/core/function.py` contains the `Subs` class which supports substitution by matching expression patterns. The `sympy/series/limits.py` file includes the `limit` function, which is relevant for handling limits in SymPy, supporting the investigation into the behavior of expressions when certain variables approach specific values, which is directly related to the issue of substitutions leading to undefined expressions. Given these details, all relevant components necessary for understanding and addressing the issue of substitutions leading to undefined expressions appear to be present in the file context. This includes the core substitution logic and handling of various expression types, as well as the mechanism for calculating limits to understand the behavior of expressions at critical points.",
