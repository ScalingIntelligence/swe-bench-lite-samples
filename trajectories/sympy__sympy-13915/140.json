This issue is directly related to the substitution mechanism in SymPy. From the provided search results, several relevant code spans can be identified in different files. These spans primarily involve the 'subs' method in various classes like 'Basic', 'Add', 'Mul', 'Pow', etc., which handle the substitution of variables. The 'subs' method in these classes likely plays a crucial role in the reported issue. Additionally, the '_eval_subs' method in classes like 'Add', 'Mul', 'Pow', 'Derivative', and 'Piecewise' also appear relevant as they handle the substitution scenarios specific to their respective expression types. The 'subs' method in 'PolyElement' and the '_eval_subs' method in 'Order' could also be potential candidates since they handle specific cases of substitution. Analyzing these spans should provide a comprehensive view of how substitutions are handled in different contexts within the SymPy library.",
