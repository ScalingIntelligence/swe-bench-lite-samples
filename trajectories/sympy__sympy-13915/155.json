The key areas to focus on are the implementation of the `subs` method and how substitution is handled, especially when dealing with potentially undefined expressions. The code spans provided include several relevant methods such as `Basic.subs`, `Basic._subs`, `Basic._eval_subs`, `Subs.__new__`, `Subs._eval_subs`, `Add._eval_subs`, and `Order._eval_subs`. These spans cover the core logic of substitution handling, which is directly related to the issue described.
