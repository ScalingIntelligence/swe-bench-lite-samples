To address this issue, I need to identify code spans that handle substitutions and possibly handle undefined expressions or manage limits. In the provided search results, I can see spans related to the `subs` method in `Basic` class, and the `limit` method in `Expr` class. These spans are likely relevant because they directly deal with the substitution and limit calculations that are central to resolving the reported issue. The `subs` method in `Basic` class contains the logic for substitution, which is the operation causing the undefined expression. The `limit` method in `Expr` class is relevant because it provides a way to handle undefined expressions by calculating limits, which is a suggested solution in the issue.

The user is particularly concerned about the behavior of the `subs` method when substituting `b` with `a` in an expression, resulting in an undefined expression. This issue requires careful examination of the `subs` method and its related functionalities within the `Basic` and `Expr` classes. The provided search results include critical methods such as `subs`, `_subs`, and `_eval_subs` within the `Basic` class, and `limit` within the `Expr` class. These methods are directly relevant to the problem at hand as they either handle the substitution process or the evaluation of limits to deal with undefined expressions. Additionally, the presence of the `as_leading_term` method in `Expr` suggests that leading terms can be helpful in understanding and handling undefined expressions. Based on these observations, the relevant code spans cover the implementation details of the `subs` method and its underlying logic in handling substitutions, as well as the methods designed to manage undefined expressions and limits.",
