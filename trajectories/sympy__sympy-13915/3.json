To address this, the focus should be on understanding how SymPy handles substitutions and potentially how it should handle such edge cases (e.g., division by zero). The relevant files and methods to investigate include those related to substitution and limit handling, such as the `subs` method in `Basic` and `Expr` classes, and the `limit` method in the `Expr` class. Additionally, examining the `Mul` and `Add` classes could provide insight into how arithmetic operations are handled during substitutions. The issue also suggests that the `subs` method should potentially handle cases where the substitution leads to undefined expressions more gracefully, possibly by computing limits as a fallback mechanism.",

Additionally, the `Expr` class and its `limit` method are included in these search results, which is also crucial as the solution suggests using limits to handle undefined cases. Analysis reveals that these methods are central to addressing the issue due to their direct relevance to substitution and limit calculations. The `subs` method in `Basic` is used for substitution operations within expressions and is expanded upon in the search results showing logic to handle unordered sequences and simultaneous substitutions, crucial for understanding how substitutions are processed. The `limit` method in `Expr` is utilized also transitions to other algorithmic control through links(connection of ideas) to check the switching point logic in the event of undefined parts ## Needed another analysis task, this time to interpret remaining search results for code related to fallback logic when sub-expressions become undefined.",

The user provides a specific example where substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r` results in an undefined state. However, the limit of `r` as `b` approaches `a` is calculable, suggesting that the expression should not be undefined but rather should return the limit in such cases. The provided file context shows the implementation of `subs` method in `Basic` class from `sympy.core.basic`, which is relevant to the substitution operation. The search results include additional implementations of `subs` method across different modules, which could be pertinent to handling substitutions more robustly, including handling cases where a substitution might lead to an undefined expression. The identified code spans are based on the relevance to the reported issue, focusing on implementations and methods related to substitution and handling undefined expressions.",

The `Expr` class, a subclass of `Basic`, extends this functionality to expressions, providing methods like `is_polynomial`, `is_rational_function`, and `limit`. These methods are essential for evaluating mathematical properties and limits of expressions, which could be relevant when handling substitutions that lead to undefined expressions.
