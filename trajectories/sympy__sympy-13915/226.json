This suggests that the problem might lie in the `subs` method or related evaluation methods in the core or basic modules. Given the code snippets provided, focusing on the `_eval_subs` method in classes like `Mul`, `Basic`, `ExprWithLimits`, `Subs`, `Add`, and `Pow` would be relevant. Additionally, since the limit function is used to handle the undefined case, looking into the `limit` method in the `Expr` class or related modules like `limits.py` could also be beneficial.",

The key focus is on understanding the behavior of the '_eval_subs' method in various classes within SymPy. This method is responsible for substituting variables in expressions and needs to handle cases where substitutions result in undefined expressions. The search results include several classes from different files within the SymPy codebase, each containing variations of the '_eval_subs' method. These methods are central to resolving the issue as they directly handle substitution logic. By examining these methods, we can understand how SymPy currently handles substitutions and identify potential issues or improvements related to the reported undefined expression problem. Given the widespread nature of the '_eval_subs' method across multiple classes, a thorough analysis of these methods is necessary to determine if they adequately handle or need adjustments for substitutions leading to undefined expressions.",
