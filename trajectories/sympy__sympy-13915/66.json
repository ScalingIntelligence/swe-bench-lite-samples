Specifically, the expression r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b)) becomes undefined when b is substituted by a. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that are related to handling substitutions and dealing with undefined expressions in SymPy.\n\nFirst, I will examine the code spans in 'sympy/core/basic.py' which contains the 'Basic' class with a 'subs' method. This method is central to substitution operations. Next, I will look at 'sympy/integrals/integrals.py' and 'sympy/series/limits.py' for methods related to handling undefined expressions, such as transformations and limits. Then, I will explore 'sympy/solvers/solvers.py', 'sympy/core/add.py', 'sympy/solvers/solveset.py', and 'sympy/core/mul.py' for additional context and methods that could be relevant.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the key methods to focus on are those directly related to substitution, checking for undefined behavior, and calculating limits. The primary focus will be on the 'subs' method in 'Basic', transformations and limits in 'Integral' and 'limit' functions, and any methods that handle undefined expressions or division by zero.\n\nBy analyzing these sections, I aim to identify specific code spans that handle the problematic substitution and determine if there are mechanisms to prevent or handle undefined expressions effectively.",
