This issue could potentially be in the '_eval_subs' method of classes that handle substitutions, such as 'Expr', 'Basic', 'Pow', 'Mul', 'Add', etc. Also, the 'subs' method in the 'Basic' class could be relevant. Furthermore, functionality related to handling limits, such as in the 'limit' method of the 'Expr' class, could be relevant since the issue mentions calculating the limit as a workaround.",

This suggests a need to look at the substitution logic within the library code. The search results include several key files and spans that might be relevant: 'sympy/core/basic.py' with 'Basic.subs' and '_eval_subs', 'sympy/core/add.py' with 'Add._eval_subs', 'sympy/core/mul.py' with 'Mul._eval_subs', 'sympy/core/function.py' with 'Subs.__new__', 'Subs.variables' and 'Subs._has', and 'sympy/solvers/solveset.py' with 'substitution'. These spans deal with the main substitution logic, handling of special cases, and management of variables during substitution.
