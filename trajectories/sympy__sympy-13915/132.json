The key elements to focus on are the `subs` method and the handling of undefined expressions. From the provided search results, the following are relevant:\n\n1. **sympy/core/basic.py** - This file contains the `Basic` class which has the `subs` method. This method is responsible for performing substitutions on expressions. The `_subs` method and `_eval_subs` method within this class are also relevant as they handle the substitution process in detail. These methods will help understand how substitutions are processed and how undefined expressions might be handled.\n\n2. **sympy/series/limits.py** - This file contains the `limit` function and `Limit` class, which are relevant for handling limits when expressions become undefined. This is directly related to the workaround suggested in the issue to use limits instead of substitutions when encountering undefined expressions.\n\n3. **sympy/core/function.py** - This file contains the `Subs` class, which involves substitution operations in SymPy. The `Subs.__new__`, `Subs.variables`, `Subs._has`, `Subs._eval_nseries`, and `Subs._eval_as_leading_term` methods are relevant for understanding how substitutions are managed and how they interact with series expansions and leading terms, which might also relate to undefined expressions.\n\nBy analyzing these sections of the code, we can gain insight into how substitutions are performed in SymPy and how the system handles cases where expressions become undefined. This will help in addressing the reported issue and potentially suggesting improvements or fixes where necessary.",

Additionally, the `limit` method in `sympy/series/limits.py` is also relevant as it handles the calculation of limits, which can be used to address the undefined expressions resulting from certain substitutions. The `Subs` class in `sympy/core/function.py` also appears to be related to substitutions.
