The user provides an example where substituting b with a in the expression r results in an undefined expression. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results that deal with the substitution and handling of undefined expressions in SymPy. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that: 1. The 'Basic.subs' method in 'sympy/core/basic.py' handles the substitution logic, including the simultaneous substitution option and error handling for invalid input. 2. The 'Expr.limit' method in 'sympy/core/expr.py' is responsible for calculating limits, which is a related functionality as the user mentions using limits to handle undefined expressions. 3. The 'Mul._eval_subs' method in 'sympy/core/mul.py' contains detailed logic for substitution in multiplication operations, including handling of commutative and non-commutative terms, which is likely relevant to the issue of substitution leading to undefined expressions. Based on this analysis, the identified spans in 'sympy/core/basic.py' and 'sympy/core/mul.py' are most relevant to the reported issue.",
