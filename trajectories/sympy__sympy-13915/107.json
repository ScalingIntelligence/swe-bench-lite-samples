The issue specifically mentions that substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression 'r' leads to an undefined result. The user also mentions the use of the 'limit' function as a workaround. To address this, we need to identify code spans related to substitution handling and limit calculations in the SymPy library. The provided search results contain several relevant spans: 1. In `sympy/core/basic.py`, the `Basic.subs` and `Basic._eval_subs` methods handle general substitution logic. 2. In `sympy/series/limits.py`, the `limit` function deals with limit calculations. 3. In `sympy/core/function.py`, `Application._eval_subs` and `Derivative._eval_subs` methods handle substitution for function and derivative classes. 4. In `sympy/core/power.py`, the `Pow._eval_subs` method handles substitution for power expressions. 5. In `sympy/core/mul.py`, the `Mul._eval_subs` method handles substitution for multiplication. 6. In `sympy/core/add.py`, the `Add._eval_subs` method handles substitution for addition. 7. In `sympy/core/expr.py`, the `Expr.limit` method links to limit calculations. These spans are relevant as they deal with the core functionalities needed to address the substitution issue and limit calculations. The search results do not cover all detailed logic within these methods, but they provide a starting point for investigating how substitutions and limits are handled in the codebase.",

Within these files, the `subs` and `_eval_subs` methods are notably relevant as they handle substitution operations that the issue is concerned with. These methods are found across different files, suggesting that substitution logic is distributed throughout the codebase, which is typical for a complex library like SymPy. Given the complexity and the way substitution logic is spread across files, the provided context seems comprehensive, though some fragments direct attention to other parts of the codebase not included in the context.
