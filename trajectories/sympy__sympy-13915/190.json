            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves handling of undefined expressions in SymPy's substitution method (`subs`). Specifically, when substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, the result becomes undefined due to division by zero. The user expects such cases to be handled by calculating the limit instead of directly substituting. Given the issue, it's crucial to identify the parts of the code responsible for substitution and the evaluation of expressions when they become undefined. The search results provide several relevant code spans in the `sympy` library, which include methods like `subs` and `_eval_subs` in various classes such as `Basic`, `Subs`, and `Mul`. These methods are central to the functionality of substituting variables in SymPy expressions. By examining these methods, we can determine how SymPy currently handles substitutions and identify where improvements or modifications are needed to manage cases where substitutions lead to undefined expressions. It's also important to review the functionality of `limit` methods in the context of expression evaluation to understand how limits are currently computed and to see if integration between `subs` and `limit` methods could address the issue effectively. Overall, the identified code spans in `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/function.py`, `sympy/core/mul.py`, and others are relevant to understanding how substitution works and where enhancements or new handling of undefined cases could be implemented.",
