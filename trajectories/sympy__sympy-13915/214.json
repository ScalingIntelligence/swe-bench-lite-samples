The specific problem occurs when substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, which results in an undefined expression. This suggests exploring the `subs` method and how it handles such substitutions, specifically checking if it correctly identifies undefined expressions. Additionally, the related `limit` method might need examination to ensure it correctly computes limits when direct substitution is not possible.",

The user provides an example where substituting `b` with `a` in an expression `r` leads to an undefined result. The user also shows that calculating the limit as `b` approaches `a` provides the correct result. The task is to identify relevant code spans that handle substitutions and potentially where handling undefined expressions might be implemented. Upon analyzing the provided search results, several key areas are identified that are relevant to the issue: The `Basic.subs` method, which is the core method for substitution in SymPy, and the `Basic._subs` method, which is a cached version of the substitution method. Additionally, the `Pow._eval_subs` and `Mul._eval_subs` methods are relevant as they handle specific cases of substitutions involving powers and multiplications, respectively. The `limit` function and the `Limit` class in `sympy.series.limits` are also relevant as they handle limits and can provide a way to handle undefined expressions. Despite finding relevant methods for substitution and limit handling, the search task is not yet complete as there might be other parts of the codebase that specifically handle cases where substitutions lead to undefined expressions or could be instrumental in implementing new functionality to handle such cases. Further search is needed to ensure completeness.",
