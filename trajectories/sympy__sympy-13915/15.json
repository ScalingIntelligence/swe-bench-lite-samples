Specifically, the substitution of 'b' by 'a' in the expression 'r' results in an undefined expression. The code provided suggests that the problem is with the 'subs' method in the SymPy library. Relevant classes and methods are likely in 'Mul', 'Add', 'Basic', 'Expr', and 'Subs'. The issue also mentions calculating the limit using 'limit' method which implies looking into 'limit' method in 'Expr' and potentially in 'Limit' class in 'sympy.series.limits'. It's also useful to check 'subs' method implementations across these classes. Since no files have been identified yet and the issue is clearly related to SymPy's substitution and limit handling, a targeted search on these specific methods and classes should be conducted first using the provided file paths and method names as hints.",

However, it does not explicitly handle cases where substitutions lead to undefined expressions. The 'Expr' class implements the 'limit' method but does not override the 'subs' method, suggesting that the functionality for dealing with such undefined expressions might be within the 'limit' method itself. Given that the issue involves substitution leading to undefined expressions and calculating limits, examining the 'Limit' class in 'sympy.series.limits' does not seem to add more relevant context within the file provided. Thus, based on the provided context, I believe all relevant parts of the code dealing with these issues have been identified. For completeness, one should ensure that the 'Limit' class in 'sympy.series.limits' is thoroughly examined for full context.",
