Specifically, when substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r`, the result should ideally be evaluated as `-1` using limits, but the expression becomes undefined. The key focus is on the `_subs` and `_eval_subs` methods in the Sympy codebase, which are responsible for substituting variables in expressions. The analysis of the search results reveals several relevant spans of code in different files. Notably, `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/add.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, `sympy/core/mul.py`, and `sympy/core/function.py` contain classes and methods that handle substitution, including `Basic._subs`, `Add._eval_subs`, `exp._eval_subs`, `Mul._eval_subs`, and `Derivative._eval_subs`. These methods are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the substitution behavior that leads to undefined expressions. The decision to identify these spans is based on their direct relevance to the substitution mechanisms and their potential to cause or resolve the undefined expression issue mentioned in the reported issue.",

Specifically, the methods `_subs` in classes `Basic`, `Add`, `exp`, `Mul`, and `Derivative` are central to substitution logic. These methods handle different aspects of substitution, including how to manage expressions when certain substitutions lead to undefined results. For instance, the `_subs` method in `Add` class handles cases involving rational coefficients, and the `_subs` method in `Mul` class ensures that mismatches in signs or unmatched terms are handled appropriately. The `_subs` method in `exp` class specifically targets substitutions involving exponential functions. Thus, the provided file context comprehensively covers the relevant parts of the codebase necessary to address the reported issue. Given that these methods cover the necessary functionality for managing substitutions, including edge cases like undefined expressions, I can conclude that the relevant code has been identified and task can be considered complete.",
