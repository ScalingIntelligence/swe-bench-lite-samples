Specifically, substituting 'b' with 'a' in the given expression results in an undefined expression, and the user is looking for a way to handle such cases more gracefully. Analysis of the provided search results shows that the 'Basic.subs' method in 'sympy/core/basic.py' is directly relevant to this issue as it defines how substitutions are performed. Additionally, since the user mentions using limits to handle such cases, the 'Expr.limit' method in 'sympy/core/expr.py' and the 'limit' function in 'sympy/series/limits.py' are also relevant for implementing a workaround using limits. Furthermore, since the issue involves matrix operations and substitutions, the 'Vector.subs' method in 'sympy/physics/vector/vector.py' and the 'PolyElement.subs' method in 'sympy/polys/rings.py' may also provide insights or handle similar substitution issues. The 'MatrixCalculus.limit' method in 'sympy/matrices/matrices.py' could also be relevant for handling limits in matrix operations. Based on these findings, I have identified the relevant code spans that should provide a thorough understanding and potential solutions to the issue.",
