The `subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` is critical for the substitution operation that is failing in the issue. The `limit` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` is also relevant as it is used to calculate the limit when the expression becomes undefined due to the substitution. Additional methods such as `_subs` and `_eval_subs` are examined to understand the internal workings of the substitution operation. The search results provided additional context by covering `Mul`, `Pow`, and `Rational` classes, which are key components of the algebraic operations involved in the issue. By reviewing these areas, I can accurately identify the most relevant code spans to the reported issue.",
