The specific problem arises when substituting 'b' with 'a' in the expression 'r', which leads to undefined behavior. The context provided suggests that the substitution mechanism might need to handle singularities more gracefully. The relevant classes and methods to investigate include 'Mul', 'Basic', 'Expr', 'Subs', and 'ExpressionWithLimits', all of which have '_eval_subs' methods. Also, the 'limit' method in 'Expr' might be relevant for handling limits as a substitute for direct substitution when subexpressions become undefined.",

The key methods of interest are `_eval_subs` and `_subs` within the `Mul`, `Basic`, and `Subs` classes, among others. These methods are responsible for handling the substitution logic in expressions and can provide insights into how undefined expressions might be occurring. Additionally, it's important to note the presence of `_eval_subs` in classes like `ExprWithLimits` and `Pow`, which also deal with substitution operations within their respective mathematical constructs, suggesting that the problem could be distributed across different expression types. Given the complexity of SymPy's handling of expressions through various classes and methods, understanding where the substitution operation fails or leads to undefined returns becomes crucial for resolving the reported issue.",
