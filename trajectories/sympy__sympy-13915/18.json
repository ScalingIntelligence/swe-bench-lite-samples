Given the relevance of the `subs` method in SymPy, it's crucial to locate the exact implementation within the provided file context. Additionally, understanding how SymPy handles undefined expressions or limits could provide insights.

The user has provided a specific expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))` and observes that substituting `b` with `a` makes `r` undefined. The user also mentions the need to calculate the limit when `b` approaches `a`. The search results contain relevant code spans that handle substitution (`_subs` and `_eval_subs` methods) and limit calculations (`limit` method) in various parts of the SymPy codebase. These code spans are primarily located in files such as `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/expr.py`, `sympy/core/mul.py`, `sympy/core/function.py`, and `sympy/core/power.py`. Each file contains specific methods that are likely related to how SymPy handles substitutions and limits. For instance, the `_subs` method in `Basic` class and the `_eval_subs` method in the `Expr` class are crucial for understanding how SymPy processes substitutions. Additionally, the `limit` method in the `Expr` class is relevant for handling limit calculations. These methods will provide insight into the logic behind substitution handling and the conditions under which expressions become undefined. By analyzing these methods, we can identify the code spans that are most relevant to the reported issue.",
