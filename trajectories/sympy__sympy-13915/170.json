The provided search results contain several relevant files and code spans that deal with substitution functionality in SymPy. The most pertinent spans are those in 'sympy/core/basic.py' and 'sympy/core/add.py'. Both these files contain implementations of the 'subs' method and related evaluation methods that can affect how substitutions are handled, which is likely where the issue arises. Additionally, the implementation in 'sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py' for 'exp._eval_subs' may also be relevant if the expression involves exponentials. However, it remains to focus primarily on the 'subs' and '_eval_subs' methods in 'sympy/core/basic.py' and 'sympy/core/add.py' as these are more directly tied to the substitution behavior.",

The user provides an example where substituting 'b' with 'a' in a particular expression results in an undefined expression, even though calculating the limit could provide a meaningful result. The user is using SymPy version 1.1.1 and is interested in how the substitution works and why it leads to undefined expressions in certain cases.\n\nReviewing the search results, it's clear that several files and functions are relevant to this issue, particularly those involving the `subs` method, `_eval_subs`, and `limit`. The files `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/add.py`, `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, and `sympy/series/limits.py` are particularly important as they contain implementations and evaluations of substitution methods and limit calculations.\n\nThe `subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` is crucial as it handles the substitution of variables. The method involves converting arguments to a sequence of substitutions, processing each substitution, and handling simultaneous substitutions if specified. The `_eval_subs` method is further defined in various classes like `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, and `exp`, which are essential for evaluating substitutions in different types of expressions.\n\nThe `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` is also significant as it deals with evaluating limits, which the user is trying to do when a simple substitution fails.\n\nThese insights indicate that the relevant code spans across handling substitutions and evaluating limits in different expression types within SymPy, which aligns with the reported issue of handling substitutions that lead to undefined expressions.",

            "scratch_pad": "In the reported issue, the focus is on handling substitutions that lead to undefined expressions in SymPy. The provided search results contain multiple files and spans of code related to the `subs` method, which is crucial for implementing substitutions in SymPy expressions. The issue specifically mentions that substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r` leads to an undefined expression, but the limit can still be calculated. This suggests that the `subs` method should handle these edge cases where substitutions create undefined subexpressions.\n\nThe `basic.py` file contains the `Basic.subs` method, which is a general method for performing substitutions. The `Basic._subs` method is also present, which is a more detailed method for substituting expressions.\n\nIn `power.py`, the `Pow._eval_subs` method is defined, which handles substitutions for power expressions. The `Mul._eval_subs` method in `mul.py` handles substitutions for multiplication expressions.\n\nIn `add.py`, the `Add._eval_subs` method is defined, which handles substitutions for addition expressions. Additionally, the `exp._eval_subs` method in `exponential.py` handles substitutions for exponential expressions.\n\nThe `expr.py` file defines the `Expr` class, which is a base class for algebraic expressions in SymPy, including methods for performing substitutions.\n\nThe `function.py` file contains the `Derivative._eval_subs` and `Subs._eval_subs` methods, which handle substitutions for derivative and substitution expressions, respectively.\n\nThe `piecewise.py` file contains the `Piecewise._eval_subs` method, which handles substitutions for piecewise expressions.\n\nPossibly relevant, the `rings.py` file contains the `PolyElement.subs` method, which handles substitutions for polynomial elements.\n\nGiven the issue's specifics and the breadth of the methodology involved, it is essential to thoroughly review and analyze these spans to identify appropriate code modifications or additions to address the reported issue. Understanding how the `subs` method responds to unanticipated substitutions is crucial for this task. Based on the issue description, it appears that handling undefined expressions and calculating limits may require new methodology within the existing framework.",
