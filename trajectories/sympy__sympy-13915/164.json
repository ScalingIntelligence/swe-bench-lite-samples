This can be explored further by looking into the '_eval_subs' method in the relevant classes, such as 'Basic', 'Expr', 'Mul', 'Add', and 'Pow'. Additionally, since handling limits is also part of this problem, it's important to also search for methods related to 'limit' handling in classes like 'Expr' and 'Limit'. Search should cover both the logic and setup of substitution and limit calculation within these classes and their methods.",
