Specifically, substituting 'b' with 'a' in an expression 'r' results in an undefined expression, even though the limit as 'b' approaches 'a' can be calculated. The search should focus on the substitution and limit calculation functionalities within SymPy. Relevant files and methods identified initially include 'Mul', 'Basic', 'Expr', and 'Subs' classes, which handle substitution, and 'limit' function in 'expr.py' for limit calculations. The search should also consider other files involved in symbolic manipulation and evaluation, such as 'integrals.py', 'solvers.py', and 'series/limits.py'.",

The specific expression given in the issue involves substituting 'b' with 'a' in a formula, which results in an undefined expression. We are also directed to use the limit function to handle such cases gracefully. The search results provide context from multiple files such as 'mul.py', 'basic.py', 'function.py', and 'limits.py'. These files contain methods like '_eval_subs', 'limit', 'Subs', and 'matches' which are fundamental for understanding how substitutions and limits are handled within SymPy. Among the search results, 'Mul._eval_subs' and 'limit' from 'limits.py' appear most relevant as they directly deal with substituting variables and calculating limits. However, it's crucial to analyze the entire logic within the '_eval_subs' method in 'mul.py' to fully understand how variable substitutions such as in the issue are handled. Additionally, the 'limit' function in 'limits.py' is crucial for defining behavior when expressions become undefined, closely aligning with the need to handle the reported issue.",
