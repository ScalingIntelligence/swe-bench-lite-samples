The provided files hint at the relevant parts of SymPy's core and series modules. Specifically, looking into the implementation of the subs method in the Basic, Expr, and other related classes is crucial. Additionally, understanding how limits are handled in SymPy could provide insights into managing undefined expressions. Therefore, the search should focus on the subs method in different classes and the limit handling functions.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves the behavior of the `subs` method in SymPy when substituting 'b' with 'a' in an expression, leading to an undefined result. To address this, we need to examine the implementation of the `subs` and `_eval_subs` methods in the relevant classes to understand how substitutions are handled and how undefined expressions can be managed. Given the search results, we can analyze the spans in the context of the issue.\n\nIn sympy/core/basic.py, the `subs` method in the `Basic` class provides the main substitution logic, including handling unordered sequences and sympifying inputs. The `_subs` method is a cached method that performs deeper substitution, considering the recursive nature of the substitution process. The `_eval_subs` method in the `Basic` class is designed for subclasses to provide specific substitution rules.\n\nIn sympy/core/power.py, the `_eval_subs` method in the `Pow` class handles substitutions specifically for power expressions, including the treatment of rational coefficients and checking for undefined expressions.\n\nIn sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py, the `_eval_subs` method in the `exp` class manages substitutions specifically for exponential functions, including handling substitutions within the exponent.\n\nAcross multiple files (sympy/core/mul.py, sympy/concrete/expr_with_limits.py, sympy/core/add.py, sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py, sympy/core/function.py, sympy/series/order.py), the `_eval_subs` methods handle substitutions for their respective classes, potentially impacting how substitutions in composed expressions are evaluated.\n\nThe focus should be on how these methods handle special cases where the substitution leads to undefined expressions, such as division by zero, and how they manage the logic to avoid such cases or return appropriate results (like Python's `None` or an undefined indicator).\n\nThese methods and their implementations are crucial in understanding and potentially addressing the undefined substitution issue reported.",
