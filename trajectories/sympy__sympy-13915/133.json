The substitution operation is likely failing due to a division by zero. To resolve this, it would be beneficial to identify how SymPy handles substitutions in expressions containing divisions and how it deals with potential undefined expressions. Specifically, the focus should be on the '_eval_subs' methods in classes like 'Mul', 'Basic', 'ExprWithLimits', 'Subs', 'Add', and 'Pow'. Additionally, understanding the 'limit' function in the 'Expr' class might provide insight into how SymPy deals with undefined subexpressions. Given the nature of the issue, the selection of search parameters is targeted at the core SymPy modules where substitution and evaluation logic is handled.",

Specifically, substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r` results in an undefined value. This issue is related to how the substitution is handled, particularly when dealing with division by zero scenarios during substitution. The key components to identify in the search results are the implementations of the `_subs` and `_eval_subs` methods across different classes, as these methods are responsible for handling substitutions. Additionally, the `Limit` class and its methods are relevant for understanding how limits are calculated in SymPy, which might provide a workaround for the undefined expression. After analyzing the search results, it is evident that the code spans identified in `Basic`, `Mul`, `Add`, `Pow`, and `Limit` classes are directly relevant to the issue at hand. These classes contain methods that manage substitutions and limits, which could either be the cause of the problem or provide a solution to handle such cases more gracefully.",

The file context includes core modules like basic.py, limits.py, mul.py, add.py, and power.py which handle various aspects of SymPy's functionality. In particular, the _eval_subs method in each of these modules is relevant to the substitution operation. The context provides insights into how the substitution logic is implemented for Basic, Mul, Add, and Pow classes, including handling of undefined expressions. However, specific details on how undefined expressions are dealt with during substitution are not fully detailed in the provided code. For instance, the _eval_subs method in the Mul class includes logic to handle substitutions in the presence of commutative and non-commutative terms, but it does not explicitly address division by zero or other scenarios that lead to undefined expressions. Similarly, in the Pow class, the _eval_subs method handles substitutions based on the exponent and base, but it does not explicitly handle conditions where the substitution would lead to an undefined expression due to division by zero or other such scenarios. Given the nature of the issue, more specific handling of undefined expressions in substitution logic, especially related to division by zero, might need further examination in the actual codebase or deeper understanding of SymPy's internal handling of such cases.",
