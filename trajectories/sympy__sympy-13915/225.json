This suggests that the problem lies in the handling of substitutions and possibly the evaluation of limits. The relevant classes and functions to investigate are those related to substitution (`subs`), limit calculations (`limit`), and possibly expressions handling (`Expr`). From the provided file context, we can see that the files containing these functionalities are distributed across various modules. I will focus specifically on the `_eval_subs` method within classes like `Basic`, `Expr`, `Mul`, `Add`, and also `limit` function and its related classes. Additionally, I need to look into how expressions are handled when substitutions lead to undefined values, which might involve the `_combine_inverse` methods or the `transform` method in integrals.",

The analysis of the search results reveals several relevant code spans that handle substitutions, expressions, and limits. The main focus is on the `subs` and `_subs` methods in sympy/core/basic.py, which are responsible for substituting expressions. Additionally, the `_eval_subs` methods in sympy/concrete/expr_with_limits.py and sympy/core/expr.py are relevant for evaluating substitutions. Furthermore, the `limit` method in sympy/core/expr.py is important for calculating limits, which is a suggested approach for handling undefined expressions.\n\nThese code spans are crucial because they directly address the scenarios where substitutions may lead to undefined expressions, and the use of limits to handle such cases. By examining these code spans, we can understand how SymPy handles and manages expressions that become undefined during substitutions, providing insight into potential fixes or improvements to address the reported issue.",

Additionally, the `limit` method within `Expr` is relevant for calculating limits, although the actual limit calculation logic resides in the `sympy.series.limits.limit` function which is not included in the provided context.
