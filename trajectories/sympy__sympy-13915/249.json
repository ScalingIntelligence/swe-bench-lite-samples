Specifically, the expression r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b)) becomes undefined when b is substituted by a. This issue is related to the implementation of the 'subs' method in SymPy's core classes such as Basic, ExprWithLimits, and Mul. The search results provide code spans that are relevant to the 'subs' method and its handling of substitutions. The 'Basic.subs' span defines the 'subs' method for the Basic class, which is a fundamental class in SymPy. The 'Basic._subs' span contains a cached version of the substitution method. The 'ExprWithLimits._eval_subs' span handles substitutions for expressions with limits. The 'Derivative._eval_subs' span is relevant as it handles substitutions for derivatives, which could be indirectly related to the issue. The 'Subs._eval_subs' span is crucial as it specifically handles the Subs class, which is used for substitutions. The 'Mul._eval_subs' span is relevant as it handles substitutions for multiplication operations, which could involve the problematic expression. Based on these observations, the identified spans are relevant to the reported issue, as they cover the core functionalities related to substitutions in SymPy.",

Specifically, add a condition to detect if substituting `b` with `a` results in an undefined expression and handle it appropriately. This could involve returning a special value indicating the expression is undefined or taking an alternate path that leads to the result of the limit calculation.\n\nThe `_subs` method should be modified at two points: first, where the substitution check begins (line 1030) to include a check for undefined states when substituting `b` with `a`. This check should be done before proceeding with the substitution. This involves adding new logic to handle the case where performing the substitution would lead to an undefined expression. This logic will determine whether to return a special value or to detour the computation in a specific manner.",
