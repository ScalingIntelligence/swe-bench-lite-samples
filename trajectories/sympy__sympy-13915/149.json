The provided search results include several relevant code spans from different files, notably 'sympy/core/function.py' and 'sympy/core/basic.py', which contain classes and methods related to substitution (Subs, Lambda, and Basic.subs). These spans provide the necessary context to understand how substitutions are implemented and potentially identify where checks for undefined expressions might be missing or need enhancement. It's crucial to note the implementation details of methods like '__new__' in the Subs class and the subs method within the Basic class, as these are directly responsible for handling and performing substitutions.

Given the provided context, it appears that the core functionality for substitution, which could lead to undefined expressions if not handled properly, is covered. However, the specific handling of undefined expressions or division by zero scenarios within the `subs` method is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. This could suggest that while the core functionality is present, the exact handling of the undefined scenarios as described in the issue might require further investigation in the broader codebase, possibly in other modules or classes related to expression handling, limits, or exception management.",

The user provides an example in SymPy and explains that the substitution results in an undefined expression, which can be handled using limits.\n2. The current file context includes the `subs` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` and the `Subs` class in `sympy/core/function.py`. These are relevant because they deal with substitution and handling of substitutions.\n3. The new search results include various files and spans of code. Key spans to consider are `sympy/core/power.py` for `Pow._eval_subs`, `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` for vector operations, and `sympy/solvers/solvers.py` for `checksol` which checks if a solution satisfies an equation.\n4. Of particular interest is `Pow._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/power.py` which deals with substitution for power expressions. This is relevant because the reported issue involves a power expression that becomes undefined upon substitution.\n5. Also relevant is `sympy/core/basic.py` which contains the `_eval_subs` method for the `Basic` class. This method is the base for substitution in SymPy expressions.\n6. The `AccumulationBounds.__div__` in `sympy/calculus/util.py` might also be relevant as it deals with division and undefined results involving 0.\n\nBased on these considerations, the relevant spans of code are those that deal with substitution, particularly for power expressions and for handling undefined results.",

Checking if there are specific checks or limits applied to avoid undefined expressions. From the provided context and search results, several relevant code spans have been identified. Notably, the 'Subs' class in 'core/function.py' is crucial as it handles substitution operations. The 'Basic.subs' and 'Pow._eval_subs' methods are also important, as they are involved in the substitution process. In the search results, the 'limit' function in 'calculus/util.py' and the 'limit' method in 'functions/special/hyper.py' could be relevant for handling undefined expressions by computing limits. Another area to consider is the 'AccumulationBounds' class, which might handle undefined behavior when dealing with bounds and divisions.",

Similarly, the `Basic` class and its `subs` method from `sympy/core/basic.py` are crucial for understanding how substitutions are processed at a basic level in SymPy. Additionally, the `Pow` class from `sympy/core/power.py` is relevant as it involves power operations that could become undefined due to substitutions, aligning with the issue's concern about undefined expressions. The `AccumulationBounds` class from `sympy/calculus/util.py` provides methods for handling bounds and divisions, which are also relevant contexts for dealing with undefined expressions. The `limit` function from `sympy/series/limits.py` is explicitly related to handling limits, which the issue suggests as a way to manage undefined subexpressions. Overall, the provided file context covers a substantial part of the relevant code needed to understand and potentially address the issue of substitutions leading to undefined expressions in SymPy.",
