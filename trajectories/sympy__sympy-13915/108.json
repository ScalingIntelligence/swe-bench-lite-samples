The key method involved is 'subs', which is used for substitution. The error points to an area where expressions become undefined during substitution, likely in the '_eval_subs' method or similar handling substitutions. Additionally, handling limits is relevant since a limit can be calculated in cases where the expression becomes undefined. The search should focus on methods related to substitution and handling of undefined expressions, specifically in the core and series modules where 'subs' and 'limit' methods are typically implemented.",

The key parts of the issue are the substitution operation and the limit calculation. I have reviewed the search results and identified code spans that directly deal with substitution and limit calculation within the SymPy codebase. The relevant files are sympy/core/function.py, sympy/core/basic.py, sympy/series/limits.py, and sympy/core/expr.py. In sympy/core/function.py, I found a class Subs that deals with the substitution operation. In sympy/core/basic.py, I found the subs method in the Basic class which is a core functionality for substitution in SymPy expressions. In sympy/series/limits.py, there are classes and methods related to limit calculation which are relevant when the substitution leads to an undefined expression. Finally, in sympy/core/expr.py, I found the limit method in the Expr class which is used to calculate limits for SymPy expressions. Based on this analysis, I have selected the appropriate code spans that are most relevant to the reported issue.",
