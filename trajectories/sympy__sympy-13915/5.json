The focus is on understanding how the `subs` method handles such cases and exploring if the limit function can be used instead. Initial analysis points to the `Basic.subs` and `Expr._eval_subs` methods as key areas to investigate for understanding the substitution logic. Additionally, the `limit` method from `sympy.series.limits` is relevant for handling undefined expressions.\n\nFrom the search results, several key sections of the codebase are identified as relevant:\n1. `Basic.subs` in `sympy/core/basic.py` which defines the `subs` method for the `Basic` class.\n2. `Basic._eval_subs` and `Expr._eval_subs` in `sympy/core/basic.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` which handle the evaluation of substitutions.\n3. The `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` which is used to compute limits and handle undefined expressions.\n\nThese sections are crucial for understanding how substitutions are processed and how undefined expressions are managed in SymPy. It appears that the `subs` method does not handle undefined expressions gracefully and may need enhancements to handle such cases effectively, potentially integrating more deeply with the `limit` function.\n\nGiven the analysis, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of SymPy's substitution and limit handling mechanisms, aligning well with the reported issue.",
