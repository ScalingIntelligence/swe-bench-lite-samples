            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with substitution in SymPy, particularly focusing on how substitutions are handled in expressions like 'Mul', 'Add', and 'Pow'. Given the description of the issue, the focus should be on methods like '_eval_subs' within these classes. The provided search results contain implementations of these methods in various files of the SymPy library. Below, I outline the analysis and justification for selecting relevant code spans.\n\n1. **sympy/core/mul.py**: This file contains the 'Mul' class which is relevant for the operations involving multiplication. The '_eval_subs' method within the 'Mul' class is crucial as it handles the substitution logic for multiplication expressions. This is directly related to the reported issue since it involves substitution in mathematical expressions.\n\n2. **sympy/core/basic.py**: The 'Basic' class and its '_subs' method are fundamental as they provide the base implementation for substitution in all SymPy expressions. Although the 'Basic' class is more generic, understanding how substitutions are managed at the basic level is essential for a holistic understanding of the substitution mechanics in SymPy.\n\n3. **sympy/core/add.py**: The 'Add' class is analogous to the 'Mul' class but for addition expressions. The '_eval_subs' method in 'Add' is essential as it handles substitutions in addition expressions, which are a common part of mathematical expressions including the one in the issue.\n\n4. **sympy/core/power.py**: The 'Pow' class and its '_eval_subs' method are relevant for handling power expressions. Since the issue involves an expression with a denominator that becomes undefined upon substitution, handling cases like this in the 'Pow' class is critical.\n\n5. **sympy/core/function.py**: The '_eval_subs' methods in the 'Application', 'Derivative', and 'Subs' classes provide the substitution logic for functions and derivatives. While the issue does not directly involve these types of expressions, understanding the behavior when substitutions where done in contexts like these can provide a broader perspective.\n\n6. **sympy/core/numbers.py**: The '_eval_subs' method in the 'Number' class handles substitutions in numerical values. Since the evaluation of mathematical expressions often involves numbers, this method is relevant to grasp how substitutions in numerical context might influence the behavior outlined in the issue.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans directly relate to the reported issue by providing the underlying implementation of substitution logic across different types of mathematical expressions in SymPy. Therefore, all the mentioned spans are included as required for a comprehensive understanding and addressing of the issue.",

The analysis of the provided search results revealed several key spans of code that are relevant to the issue. These include the `_eval_subs` methods from various classes such as `Mul`, `Basic`, `Add`, `Pow`, and `Derivative`. These methods dictate how substituions are handled in different mathematical operations such as multiplication, basic expressions, addition, powers, and derivatives. The detailed examination of these methods was conducted to understand how substitutions are currently implemented and determine any potential bugs or areas of improvement, particularly when substitutions result in undefined expressions. The `Mul._eval_subs` method contains logic that handles negative numbers, commutative and noncommutative objects, and the division of coefficients and exponents. The `Basic._subs` method features a cache system and fallback mechanism, while `Add._eval_subs` also handles coefficients and terms in additions. The `Pow._eval_subs` method explicitly handles the substitution of base and exponent expressions for powers. These insights help pinpoint the most relevant code that should be examined or possibly modified to fix the reported issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue involves a substitution that leads to an undefined expression. The key to solving this issue lies in understanding how the substitution mechanism works in SymPy, particularly in the `_eval_subs` methods of various classes like `Mul`, `Add`, `Pow`, and `Basic`. These methods are responsible for handling substitutions and ensuring that the operations involving the substituted expressions are correctly evaluated. The provided search results and context focus on these classes and their methods, which are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue. The `_eval_subs` method in the `Mul` class, for instance, handles the substitution logic for multiplication-related expressions. Similarly, `Basic._eval_subs` handles the substitution for the base class, while `Add._eval_subs` and `Pow._eval_subs` manage the substitution logic for addition and power expressions, respectively. These methods need to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that substitutions that lead to undefined expressions are handled gracefully, possibly by implementing a check for such conditions or modifying the substitution logic to avoid undefined outcomes. Additionally, the `lambda` function substitution in the `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` file might also be relevant if lambda functions are used in the context of the substitution issue. Overall, the issue requires a detailed examination of substitution logic across different classes and potentially adjusting this logic to prevent undefined outcomes.",
