This suggests a potential bug or limitation in the subs method or its related functionalities in SymPy. The provided context points to several files in the SymPy library that might be relevant for investigating this issue, focusing on classes and methods related to substitution, such as 'Mul', 'Basic', 'Integral', 'Limit', 'Expr', and others. These files should be examined for implementations of subs, eval_subs, and related logic to understand how substitution is handled and how it might lead to undefined expressions. Additionally, the limit method might be relevant for understanding how SymPy handles undefined expressions mathematically.",

The issue arises when the symbol 'b' is substituted by 'a', causing an undefined expression. The user is looking for the relevant code spans that handle the substitution logic to understand why this undefined behavior occurs. \n\nThe search results include multiple files from the SymPy library, focusing on the core modules that deal with expressions, substitutions, and mathematical operations. Key files include 'sympy/core/mul.py', 'sympy/core/basic.py', and 'sympy/core/expr.py', which contain classes and methods for handling multiplications, basic operations, and expressions, respectively. \n\nRelevant code spans are identified in the 'sympy/core/mul.py' file, particularly the 'Mul._eval_subs' method, which is responsible for handling substitutions in multiplication expressions. Additionally, the 'sympy/core/basic.py' file contains the 'Basic._subs' method, which is a more generic substitution method applicable to all basic SymPy objects. These methods are central to understanding how substitutions are processed within SymPy, and they align with the reported issue's focus on substitution leading to undefined expressions. \n\nThe detailed analysis of these methods and their logic helps in pinpointing how and why a substitution like 'b' to 'a' could lead to an undefined expression. By studying these methods, we can identify the conditions under which substitutions fail or lead to undefined results, which directly addresses the reported issue.",

These methods can handle commutative and non-commutative multiplications, substitutions, and matching operations, which are important for the issue at hand. Additionally, the 'Basic' class in 'sympy/core/basic.py' includes a '_subs' method that is a fallback for substitution, which suggests that this is a broad mechanism used across many SymPy classes.
