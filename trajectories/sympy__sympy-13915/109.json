The user expects that 'r.subs(b, a)' would handle the undefined case more gracefully, potentially by calculating the limit. To address this issue, I need to identify the relevant code spans in SymPy that handle substitution and possibly the evaluation of limits to see if enhancements can be made to handle undefined subexpressions more gracefully. In the provided search results, several files and code spans appear relevant. Specifically, the `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py` contains methods `subs` and `_subs` which are responsible for substitution operations. Additionally, the `Expr` class in `sympy/core/expr.py` contains a method `limit` which might be relevant for handling undefined expressions by calculating limits. To fully address the issue, it would be beneficial to review these methods in detail to understand how they handle substitutions and undefined expressions, and whether they can be modified or enhanced to better handle the case where a substitution leads to an undefined expression.",
