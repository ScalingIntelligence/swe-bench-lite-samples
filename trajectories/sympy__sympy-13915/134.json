By analyzing the provided code spans, we can identify key sections that might contribute to this behavior. Specifically, we should look at the `subs` method in the `Basic` class and its overridden methods in subclasses like `Application`, `Derivative`, `Subs`, and `Pow`. These sections handle the substitution logic and return `None` or raise errors when certain conditions are met, which could be the cause of the undefined expression. We also need to consider the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, as the reported issue suggests using limits as an alternative to handle undefined expressions.",
