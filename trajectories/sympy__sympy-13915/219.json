            "scratch_pad": "The issue involves a substitution in the SymPy library that leads to an undefined expression when `b` is substituted by `a`. This behavior can be traced to specific methods and classes within SymPy's core module, such as `Basic`, `Expr`, `Mul`, and `Add`, as they contain the `subs` and `_eval_subs` methods which are crucial for substitution logic. Additionally, the `Limit` class in `sympy/series/limits.py` and the `limit` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` are relevant for handling undefined expressions through limits. It's also important to check utilities like `_smart_subs` in `sympy/physics/mechanics/functions.py` and methods like `transform` in `sympy/integrals/integrals.py` that might handle similar substitutions or transformations.",

Specifically, when `b` is substituted for `a` in the expression `r`, it becomes undefined. The user expects the substitution to handle such cases without leading to undefined results.\n2. Reviewed the current file context: No relevant code identified yet.\n3. Processed new search results:\n3.1. Examined each code span in the search results to match it with the key elements or patterns from the reported issue.\n3.2. Focused on spans related to substitution (`subs`), which is the main operation reported to cause the problem. Identified relevant spans in `sympy/core/basic.py` (`Basic.subs` and `Basic._subs`) and `sympy/core/mul.py` (`Mul._eval_subs`).\n3.3. Evaluated if additional functions or classes might be necessary to implement the expected functionality. Identified `Limit` in `sympy/series/limits.py` as potentially relevant if handling undefined expressions.\n3.4. Reviewed entire sections of code to ensure a complete understanding. Sections involving `subs` were examined to understand their logic and how they might be modified to handle undefined expressions.\n3.5. Considered if there are references to other parts of the codebase that might be relevant but not found in the search results.\n3.6. Identified and extracted relevant code spans based on the reported issue.\n4. Determined that the provided search results contain relevant code spans that need to be reviewed and possibly modified to address the issue.",
