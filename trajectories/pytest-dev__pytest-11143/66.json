Given the stack trace, the error originates from the 'rewrite_asserts' function in '_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py'.

I've identified the most relevant code spans, specifically those dealing with the assertion rewrite process, as the error originates from the rewrite mechanism in pytest. The identified spans include functions `_rewrite_test`, `rewrite_asserts`, and the method `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled`.

To fix the issue, it is essential to locate where the docstring is extracted and ensure it correctly handles non-string literals.

The relevant code in the `AssertionRewriter` class includes the `run` method, which handles the docstring check, and the `is_rewrite_disabled` static method, which specifically checks for the presence of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in the docstring. From the search results, it's evident that the `run` method processes the module's docstring and calls `is_rewrite_disabled`.

If conditions are met, it sets the extracted docstring to 'doc'. Notably, 'ast.Constant' in Python 3.8+ would not include non-string literals like integers, which aligns with the prevention of TypeErrors. Therefore, the actual extraction and type checking are thorough and suitable for preventing the described error. However, there's still some uncertainly on the wrapper function '_rewrite_test' where 'ast.parse' might handle the first non-string literal expressions differently than expected, potentially causing the issue. Further inspection around this part might be necessary, especially on how the tree object is created and what possibilities or safeguards exist for unexpected data handling around 'docstring' processing directly in 'ast.parse' or downstream methods called on the subtree such as '_rewrite_test', despite the critical code path handling the majority of the case.",
