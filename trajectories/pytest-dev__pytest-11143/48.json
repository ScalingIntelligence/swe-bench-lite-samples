This error occurs during the pytest collection phase, specifically in the `AssertionRewriter` class within the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file. The error is triggered by the `is_rewrite_disabled` method, which attempts to check for the presence of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in the docstring. However, if the docstring is an integer, this operation fails with a `TypeError`. Given this context, it's crucial to focus on the parts of the code where the docstring is handled, especially in the `run` method of the `AssertionRewriter` class. This method checks if the docstring is present and valid before proceeding with the rewrite process. By examining the provided code spans in the search results, it's evident that the `run` method already contains checks to handle docstrings, but there's no explicit check for the type of the docstring. The immediate solution involves adding a type check for the docstring to ensure it's a string before performing any string operations on it. This will prevent the `TypeError` when the docstring is an integer. The relevant code spans to be identified include the `run` method and the `is_rewrite_disabled` method, as these are central to the issue.",
