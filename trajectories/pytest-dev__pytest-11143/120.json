This issue seems to be in the assertion rewriting phase of pytest, specifically in the `rewrite_asserts` function within `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`.

The error about the integer being non-iterable could be occurring within the `AssertionRewriter` class or related methods called within `rewrite_asserts`. To diagnose this, a more detailed examination of the `AssertionRewriter` class and its `run` method, as well as related helper methods or properties within this class, is necessary. Therefore, the search request should be updated to focus on methods within the `AssertionRewriter` class.

This error occurs during the collection of test cases in pytest. The traceback points to the `is_rewrite_disabled` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class within `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. The method is checking for the presence of the string 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in the docstring, but in this case, the docstring is an integer, leading to the error.\n\nReviewing the current file context, the `_rewrite_test` and `rewrite_asserts` functions are identified as relevant. The new search results show the full implementation of the `AssertionRewriter` class, which includes the `is_rewrite_disabled` method. This method is crucial as it directly relates to the issue, attempting to check for a specific string in the docstring. The method should handle cases where the docstring might not be a string, such as an integer or other types.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the `is_rewrite_disabled` method should include a type check to ensure that the docstring is a string before performing the membership test. Additionally, the `run` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class should also be reviewed to ensure that it correctly initializes and handles the docstring attribute.\n\nGiven these considerations, the relevant code spans are the entire `AssertionRewriter` class and the `_rewrite_test` function, as they are both directly involved in the process where the error occurs.",
