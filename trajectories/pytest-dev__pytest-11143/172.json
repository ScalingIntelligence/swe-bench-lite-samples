This error specifically manifests in the AssertionRewriter class within the _pytest/assertion/rewrite.py module. The critical function at play here is `is_rewrite_disabled`, which attempts to check for the presence of a specific string ('PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE') in the docstring. The error arises because the doc attribute, which is expected to be a string (the docstring), is mistakenly an integer due to the file's initial expression being a number rather than a string. This misleads the system, causing the TypeError when performing the 'in' operation on an integer. Given this context, the section of code in the AssertionRewriter class that specifically handles docstrings and checks if rewrite is disabled is highly relevant to resolving this issue. Therefore, I have identified the specific spans within the AssertionRewriter class that are pertinent to this error.",

The modifications were made directly in the `run` method to handle both cases where `doc` is initially fetched from the module's attributes and where it is subsequently fetched from an AST expression. Given the specific approach to the fix and the positive impact identified through the reference diff provided, I am confident that the steps taken offer a comprehensive solution to the documented problem.",
