The TypeError suggests that an integer is being passed where a string (docstring) is expected. \n\nReviewing the provided code spans, the relevant code spans are located in the `_rewrite_test` and `rewrite_asserts` functions, as well as within the `AssertionRewriter` class, particularly the `is_rewrite_disabled` method. These sections are directly involved in the assertion rewriting process and the check for disabling the rewrite. It's crucial to ensure that the docstring is correctly identified and processed, especially under the condition where the first expression might be a number rather than a string. \n\nGiven the context of the error and the provided code spans, the identified spans are relevant and should help in diagnosing and fixing the issue. The search task is likely complete as the code spans cover the needed functionality related to the issue.",
