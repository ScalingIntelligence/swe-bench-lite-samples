The error specifically points to a line in `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` where an attempt to check a docstring (`PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE`) fails because the first expression in the file is mistaken as a docstring and is actually an integer ('int'). This suggests that the error occurs during the initialization or handling of the `docstring` attribute in the `AssertionRewriter` class. The current context provided in `<file_context>` does not directly reference the assertion rewriting or docstring handling, which is critical for addressing the reported issue. The new search results, however, include detailed code spans from `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, particularly the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods. These methods handle the parsing and rewriting of assertions in Python test modules and include logic to determine if assertion rewriting should be disabled based on the docstring. This code is directly relevant to the reported issue as it concerns the handling of docstrings during the assertion rewriting process. Therefore, the identified spans focus on the logical flow and checks in the `AssertionRewriter` class where the docstring could be incorrectly identified or mistaken as an integer.",
