This error occurs during the test collection process, specifically in the `_rewrite_test` function within `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` when checking the docstring of the module for the presence of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE'. Given this context, I analyzed the provided `Module` class within `_pytest/python.py`, focusing on the method `_importtestmodule` which handles the import of test modules. This method directly relates to the import process where the error is suspected to occur. It attempts to import the test module, handling various exceptions like SyntaxError, ImportPathMismatchError, ImportError, and skip.Exception. If any of these exceptions occur, it raises a `CollectError`, which implies the method is involved in the early stages of module handling, relevant to what's described in the issue. Additionally, the `_pretty_fixture_path` function, although not directly related to the import process, deals with paths and file handling which could indirectly influence the issue if there are any discrepancies in file or path handling. Therefore, the method `_importtestmodule` in the `Module` class and the `_pretty_fixture_path` function are tentatively identified as relevant code spans that could address the reported issue, particularly in how module imports and file handling are managed in pytest.",
