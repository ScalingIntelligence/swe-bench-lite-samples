This issue specifically relates to the pytest assertion rewriting mechanism where it fails to correctly identify the docstring. The error traceback leads to the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file, specifically the `rewrite_asserts` function and the `is_rewrite_disabled` method which suggests a problem with how the code handles docstrings. The search results provided partially align with this issue, particularly in the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file. Here are the relevant parts: The `_rewrite_test` function is responsible for rewriting the test module, and the `rewrite_asserts` function is key as it applies the assertion rewriter to the AST tree. The `is_rewrite_disabled` method within the AssertionRewriter class is critical as it checks if the 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' tag is in the docstring, which raises the TypeError when the docstring is an integer. The spans in the results that are most relevant are the ones related to the `rewrite_asserts` function in `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and the `is_rewrite_disabled` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class.

This issue is directly related to the `_pytest.assertion.rewrite` module, as seen in the provided stack trace. The `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods, such as `run`, are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing this issue. The current context already includes relevant code spans related to `_rewrite_test` and `rewrite_asserts` in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. \n\nUpon further analysis of the new search results, it's clear that the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` are the most relevant to the issue. The `run` method of this class specifically iterates over the module's body and checks for a docstring. If the first expression in the file is an integer, it could erroneously pass this check, leading to the reported TypeError. Hence, the relevant code spans to focus on are those related to the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods handling the docstring initialization and the iteration over the module's body. These spans include the 'run' method and potentially other methods like 'visit_Attribute', 'visit_Starred', etc., that could handle different types of AST nodes during the rewrite process. This is crucial to ensure that the rewrite process correctly differentiates between docstrings and other types of expressions, especially those possibly represented as integers. Therefore, the identified code spans are sufficient to resolve the reported issue.",

In the context of the issue, it's crucial to ensure `docstring` is a string before performing the check.
