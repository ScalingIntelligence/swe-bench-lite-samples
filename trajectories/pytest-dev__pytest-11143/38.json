Specifically, the problematic method appears to be `is_rewrite_disabled`, which checks if the docstring contains 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE'.

The provided search results confirm the existence of this method in the `AssertionRewriter` class and other methods associated with the assertion rewriting process.
