The relevant part of the codebase to investigate is the `AssertionRewriter` class in the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file, particularly the `run` method where the docstring is checked and the `is_rewrite_disabled` method, which contains the line `return \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" in docstring`, which would cause the TypeError if `docstring` is an integer. The `run` method is responsible for rewriting asserts and initially checks if the docstring disables the rewrite. Given the provided context and search results, these are the most relevant sections to address the issue. The `run` method and the related checks within it are critical to understand how the first expression, especially if it's numerical, might interfere with the intended operation.",
