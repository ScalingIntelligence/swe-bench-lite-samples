This method checks if the 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' string is in the docstring.

Specifically, the `Module` class's `_importtestmodule` method is responsible for importing test modules and managing any exceptions during the import process. Additionally, the `AssertionRewriter` class in `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` has a static method `is_rewrite_disabled` that checks for the presence of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in a module's docstring. However, the method assumes that `docstring` is always a string, which could lead to the type error if a non-string value is passed. This indicates a potential area to improve by adding type checks or ensuring that only string values are passed to this method.",

This error happens during the collection of test cases and specifically within the assertion rewrite process. The traceback points to the function `is_rewrite_disabled` in `AssertionRewriter`, where the error `TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable` occurs. This suggests that the function is attempting to check a string for the presence of a specific substring ('PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE'), but instead encounters an integer. The analysis should focus on understanding how the first expression of a file, particularly when it's a number, can enter the `is_rewrite_disabled` function and why it's being treated as a string or docstring. Additionally, it's important to verify if the input to `is_rewrite_disabled` is properly sanitized and if there are any checks missing that would prevent non-string types from being processed. The provided code spans show the implementation of `AssertionRewriter` and the `is_rewrite_disabled` method, which can be used to identify the specific lines or conditions that might lead to the reported error.",
