Additionally, examining the `Module` class in `python.py` might provide insights into how modules are imported and processed during the collection phase.",

This scenario leads to a failure during the test collection phase. The codebase seems to be related to `pytest`, particularly around the `AssertionRewritingHook` class which is responsible for rewriting assert statements in tests, and the `Module` class which deals with collecting and importing test modules. Given the provided source context and the nature of the issue, the focus should be on the `AssertionRewritingHook.exec_module` method and the `Module._importtestmodule` method, as they handle module importing and the actual execution of the code after rewriting.\n\nOn examining the provided search results, one relevant fragment is `AssertionRewritingHook.exec_module` where the module's code is executed after being possibly rewriten. Another is the `Module._importtestmodule` method, which involves the importing of test modules. Analysis indicates that these methods are key interaction points for the issue cited in the input. Specific check or rewrite procedure mishap happens within these spans, as indicated when an \"`int object is not iterable\" type error arises due to the attempted iteration of a number is present where a valid docstring would ordinarily reside. Logically this error is indicative of improper data type handling potentiall when switching from doc string interpretation to non-string variable handling, per events logically staged around `AssertionRewritingHook.exec_module`.\n\nBoth `AssertionRewritingHook` and `Module` classes, detailed in the provided repo's copy, are working together towards solving this. The issue stems from the assumption in `pytest` that at the module level only have either docstrings or regular content - hence the TypeError when coming across another data inferring a wrong interpretation of the data.\n\nTo address the issue tackled here, the `exec_module` in the `AssertionRewritingHook` class and the `_importtestmodule` module from `Module` class ought to be focussed on since these areas are where the reported issue arises mainly for test module transcription potential adjustments must be initiated here. Specifically, alterations aiming to identity verify and correct how pytest deal with; possibly rewrite this handling of combinations which a number can appear effectively correcting the reported code transcription erring occurrences.",
