The error trace points to `pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, line 760. To debug and fix this issue, we need to locate specific functions and checks related to docstring handling and assertion rewriting. The pytest internals responsible for these tasks should be our focus.",

This issue is relevant to the `AssertionRewritingHook` and `AssertionRewriter` classes, which are responsible for rewriting assertions in the pytest framework. In particular, the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method is likely the source of the error as it attempts to check if a docstring contains 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE', and it expects the docstring to be a string. If the first expression is an integer instead of a string, this method will fail. Given the search results, the relevant code spans are located in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, specifically within the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods `run` and `is_rewrite_disabled`. These methods handle the rewriting of assertions and the checking of docstrings, respectively. This analysis identifies the relevant code spans that need to be addressed to fix the reported issue.",
