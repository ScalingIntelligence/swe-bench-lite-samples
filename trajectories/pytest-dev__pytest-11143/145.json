The traceback points to the function `is_rewrite_disabled` in the `AssertionRewritingHook` class, where the error occurs while checking if the string 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is in the docstring. This suggests a potential issue with how docstrings are being handled or initialized, particularly if they could be mistakenly set to an integer. From the search results, the relevant span appears to be the `is_rewrite_disabled` method implementation within the `AssertionRewritingHook` class. This method directly relates to the error context mentioned in the issue. The method checks if the 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' marker is present in the docstring and might fail if the docstring is not a string but an integer or another type. This code span is crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue where an integer is mistakenly treated as a docstring.

The provided search results confirm the existence of this class and relevant methods. Additionally, the search results include the `_rewrite_test` and `rewrite_asserts` functions which are integral to the assertion rewriting process. Since the file context already covers the methods and class involved in the issue and the search results complement this with the actual rewriting functions, it appears that all relevant code spans have been identified.

This suggests that the issue lies within the handling of docstrings during the assertion rewriting process, particularly in the `is_rewrite_disabled` method which checks for the presence of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in the docstring. However, the current error is related to treating an integer as a docstring, which implies a misinterpretation in the data type. The relevant code spans identified include the `AssertionRewritingHook` class methods, particularly the `exec_module` method which handles the rewriting of the module, and the `_rewrite_test` function which performs the actual rewrite process. The `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` static method should also be inspected as it determines if the rewrite should be disabled based on the docstring. These areas are critical for understanding and addressing the issue because they directly involve the parsing and rewriting of test files, including the handling of docstrings. Additionally, the initialization methods and the process by which modules are marked for rewrite could shed light on how the number-as-docstring scenario is being misinterpreted.",
