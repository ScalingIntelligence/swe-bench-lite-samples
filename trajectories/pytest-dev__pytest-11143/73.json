The provided search results contain detailed code spans that handle the rewriting process, including the `AssertionRewritingHook` class which manages the rewriting of assertions and the `_rewrite_test` function which performs the actual rewrite. The relevant code spans are those that handle the importing and rewriting of modules, as well as the detection of the 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' directive in docstrings.

See\n+    http://pybites.blogspot.be/2011/07/behind-scenes-of-pytests-new-assertion.html\n+    for an overview of how this works.\n+\n+    The entry point here is .run() which will iterate over all the\n+    statements in an ast.Module and for each ast.Assert statement it\n+    finds call .visit() with it.  Then .visit_Assert() takes over and\n+    is responsible for creating new ast statements to replace the\n+    original assert statement: it rewrites the test of an assertion\n+    to provide intermediate values and replace it with an if statement\n+    which raises an assertion error with a detailed explanation in\n+    case the expression is false and calls pytest_assertion_pass hook\n+    if expression is true.\n+\n+    For this .visit_Assert() uses the visitor pattern to visit all the\n+    AST nodes of the ast.Assert.test field, each visit call returning\n+    an AST node and the corresponding explanation string.  During this\n+    state is kept in several instance attributes:\n+\n+    :statements: All the AST statements which will replace the assert\n+       statement.\n+\n+    :variables: This is populated by .variable() with each variable\n+       used by the statements so that they can all be set to None at\n+       the end of the statements.\n+\n+    :variable_counter: Counter to create new unique variables needed\n+       by statements.  Variables are created using .variable() and\n+       have the form of \"@py_assert0\".\n+\n+    :expl_stmts: The AST statements which will be executed to get\n+       data from the assertion.  This is the code which will construct\n+       the detailed assertion message that is used in the AssertionError\n+       or for the pytest_assertion_pass hook.\n+\n+    :explanation_specifiers: A dict filled by .explanation_param()\n+       with %-formatting placeholders and their corresponding\n+       expressions to use in the building of an assertion message.\n+       This is used by .pop_format_context() to build a message.\n+\n+    :stack: A stack of the explanation_specifiers dicts maintained by\n+       .push_format_context() and .pop_format_context() which allows\n+       to build another %-formatted string while already building one.\n+\n+    :variables_overwrite: A dict filled with references to variables\n+       that change value within an assert. This happens when a variable is\n+       reassigned with the walrus operator\n+\n+    This state, except the variables_overwrite,  is reset on every new assert\n+    statement visited and used by the other visitors.\n+    \"\"\"\n+\n     def __init__(\n         self, module_path: Optional[str], config: Optional[Config], source: bytes\n     ) -> None:\n@@ -656,6 +713,12 @@\n             self.enable_assertion_pass_hook = False\n         self.source = source\n         self.variables_overwrite: Dict[str, str] = {}\n+\n+    @staticmethod\n+    def is_rewrite_disabled(docstring: str) -> bool:\n+        if isinstance(docstring, str):\n+            return \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" in docstring\n+        return False\n \n def run(self, mod: ast.Module) -> None:\n     \"\"\"Find all assert statements in *mod* and rewrite them.\"\"\"\n",
