The stack trace points to the `is_rewrite_disabled` method in `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, where it is trying to check if 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is in a docstring. The issue likely arises because the docstring being checked is actually an integer, not a string. To find the root cause, I should focus on the file `test_socks_user_011.py` and check the first expression to ensure it is not a number being mistaken for a docstring.",

This error is traced back to the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file, specifically in the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method. This method checks if the string 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is in the docstring of the module, but it seems that an integer is being passed instead of a string, causing the TypeError.\n\nSince the error occurs in the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method, it's crucial to focus on the handling of docstrings and ensure that they are being correctly identified as strings before any operations are performed on them. The relevant code spans in `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` include the `AssertionRewriter.run` method, where the docstring is extracted and passed to `is_rewrite_disabled`, and the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method itself. Both of these methods need to be carefully reviewed to ensure proper type handling and error prevention.\n\nThe search results provided include the necessary code spans related to the assertion rewriting process, specifically those that deal with docstring handling and the potential type mismatch error.",
