This occurs during the pytest collection phase, specifically in the assertion rewrite process. 2. Reviewed the current file context: The context provided focuses on `src/_pytest/python.py` and contains spans related to module collection and import processes. 3. Processed new search results: The new search results pertaining to `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` include spans that cover the assertion rewriting process (particularly interesting are those related to `AssertionRewritingHook` and `AssertionState`). These spans include methods like `_early_rewrite_bailout`, `_should_rewrite`, and `_is_marked_for_rewrite`, which are directly related to the assertion rewriting process and could potentially contain the logic where the issue arises. Additionally, the provided code spans in `src/_pytest/python.py` related to `Module` and its methods (`_importtestmodule`), which handle the importing and collection of test modules, are relevant as they contextualize the conditions under which the assertion rewriting occurs. 4. Matching the code spans with the issue: This analysis indicates that the key areas to focus on are those handling the rewriting process (e.g., `_rewrite_test` and methods within `AssertionRewritingHook`) in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, and the import/collection mechanism in `src/_pytest/python.py` to fully understand how files are processed during testing.
