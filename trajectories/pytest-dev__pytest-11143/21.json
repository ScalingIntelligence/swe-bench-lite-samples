The `run` method of the `AssertionRewriter` class processes the module body to rewrite asserts. There is a specific check for docstrings at the beginning of this process.

The error occurs because the docstring is being compared to an integer, not a string.

Importantly, it seems to handle the docstring separately during this process, which is marked by an `expect_docstring` variable that aids in identifying the first item to be a docstring if it's an expression and a constant.

The issue mentions that an integer is mistakenly processed as a docstring, causing a TypeError. The file context shows that the 'run' method indeed expects a docstring to be of type 'str' and processes it accordingly. It appears that the current file context provides enough information to understand and potentially fix the issue since the failure point is directly within the provided methods. Further, the code snippet indicates that the method 'is_rewrite_disabled' (which checks for the 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' string in the docstring) uses the 'in' operator, susceptible to the TypeError if the docstring argument is of type 'int'. This design necessitates a type check to confirm whether the item is a string before performing the 'in' check.",
