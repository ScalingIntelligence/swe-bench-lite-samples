The error occurs when an integer is mistakenly treated as a docstring, suggesting a problem with how the pytest assertion rewriter handles initial module expressions. The existing context suggests that the code snippet responsible might be in the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file. However, given the error's nature, it's possible there could be a broader issue with how file paths or module imports are being handled. We should specifically look at the AssertionRewriter class's `run` method in `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` and possibly any related functions where document strings might be checked or processed, ensuring that such checks do not wrongly apply to numbers.",

This error occurs within the _pytest/assertion/rewrite.py module. Analyzing the provided code spans, the relevant function causing the error is `is_rewrite_disabled`, where the TypeError occurs because the function attempts to check for the presence of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in the `docstring`. The issue arises because `docstring` is sometimes an integer, not a string, due to some initial expression being mistaken as a docstring. The solution involves ensuring that `docstring` is indeed a string before performing the check. The relevant code spans to address this issue include the `AssertionRewriter` class with its methods `__init__`, `run`, and `is_rewrite_disabled`. These methods encompass the logic for rewriting assertions and checking for the disabling directive, making them key to resolving the reported issue.",

We need to extend the search to confirm if there's a situation where an integer could mistakenly pass through these checks, especially around the `expect_docstring` condition. We should ensure that any initial expression checked for being a docstring does not improperly consider an integer as valid input.

I will start by analyzing the current file context provided in the <file_context> tag, which contains a large class 'AssertionRewriter'. This class has methods such as 'run', 'is_rewrite_disabled', and others that seem relevant to rewriting. It deals with AST nodes, docstrings, and assertions, which are related to the issue being reported.\n\nI will now analyze each code span in the new <search_results> tag. The relevant code seems to be within the 'AssertionRewriter' class, which is extended in the search results. The 'AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled' method is present in both contexts. It's used to check if 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is present in the docstring.\n\nThe method 'AssertionRewriter.run' in both contexts includes these lines: 'if doc is not None and self.is_rewrite_disabled(doc):'\nreturn', which indicates how the docstring is being checked.  The 'AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert' in search results is also worth noting as it has a hypothesis about parentheses. The 'AssertionRewriter.visit_Call' method in the search results may be useful for rewriting function calls as it modifies expressions.\n\nIt looks like the search results give us clues on bug fixing, such as handling of function calls and handling of type 'int' mistaakened as string might be resolved possibly in these areas.\n\nWe can see enough of the 'pyest rewrite assert features to conclude that the provided search results are relevant to report issue.

The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method, which checks if a string contains 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE'. The error is due to an `int` being passed instead of a `str`. This suggests that the code should ensure that docstrings are always strings before processing them. The `AssertionRewriter` class in the provided `rewrite.py` file is responsible for rewriting asserts in test modules. The relevant methods are `run` and `is_rewrite_disabled`. The `run` method processes the module's body and handles docstrings. Ensuring that docstrings are always strings before calling `is_rewrite_disabled` will prevent this TypeError. The provided search results contain the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods, including `run` and `is_rewrite_disabled`, which are the key parts of the code needed to address the issue. Thus, these sections are relevant to the reported issue.",

The `run` method processes the module body, checking for docstrings and handling them appropriately. However, the method does not explicitly check for the type of the initial expression, which might be causing the issue where an integer is mistakenly treated as a docstring. A detailed inspection of this method is necessary to ensure that all types are correctly managed to prevent such mix-ups. Additionally, the issue might be deeper, involving the interaction between pytest's collection phase and the handling of initial module expressions. Given the complexity and the specific focus on type handling within the `run` method, further inspection is warranted to confirm whether all relevant code is covered.",
