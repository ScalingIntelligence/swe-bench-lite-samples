The error suggests that an integer is being passed instead. There isn't any logic in the provided context that explicitly modifies or checks the type of docstrings before passing them to `is_rewrite_disabled`. Therefore, to resolve this issue, additional code is needed to ensure that only strings are passed to `is_rewrite_disabled`.

It is crucial to locate this caller to ensure it does not pass a non-string type to `is_rewrite_disabled`. Since we haven't identified the caller in the provided context, an examination of other parts of the code responsible for extracting and managing docstrings is necessary.

This error is happening during the collection phase of tests. The traceback indicates that the error is triggered in the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method where it checks if 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is in the docstring of the module. The issue arises because the docstring is being mistakenly assumed to be an integer. The current context and search results show significant portions of the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file, which is central to the assertion rewriting mechanism in pytest. This includes the `AssertionRewritingHook` class responsible for deciding which modules to rewrite and the `AssertionRewriter` class that actually performs the rewriting. Further analysis of the `is_rewrite_disabled` method within `AssertionRewriter` reveals that it is designed to check for the presence of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in a string. However, if the `docstring` argument is not a string, this check will fail, leading to the reported `TypeError`. The search results include other files such as `_pytest/config/__init__.py` and `_pytest/doctest.py`, but the issue seems specific to the assertion rewriting process, making these less relevant. Therefore, the main focus should remain on the `AssertionRewriter` class and its methods, especially `is_rewrite_disabled`, to ensure it handles cases where the input is not a string.",
