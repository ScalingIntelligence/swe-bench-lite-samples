The error described (`TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable`) is likely to be occurring in the `is_rewrite_disabled` method because it expects a string (docstring) and is attempting to check for the presence of a substring. The issue of a module starting with a number being mistaken as a docstring is not directly addressed in the provided context, but the context does suggest where future inspection or modification might focus to resolve the issue. Given the context, it seems plausible that the problem lies in how pytest handles module imports and possibly in how it interprets docstrings.
