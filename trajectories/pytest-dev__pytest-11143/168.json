The detailed stack trace indicates that the error occurs in the `AssertionRewriter` class in the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file, specifically at the point where it checks if 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is in the docstring. The TypeError suggests that an attempt was made to check an integer value in the docstring, implying an incorrect assumption about the type of the first expression in the file. Given the specificity of the error, it's important to review the `AssertionRewriter` class and the `is_rewrite_disabled` method to ensure it correctly handles cases where the first expression is a number. Since the error occurs during test collection, it might also be beneficial to check the test files themselves where the first expression might be a number.",
