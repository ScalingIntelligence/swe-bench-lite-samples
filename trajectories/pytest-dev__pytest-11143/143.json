The error traceback indicates that the issue occurs within the AssertionRewriter class in the _pytest/assertion/rewrite.py file. This suggests that the problem might be with how the AssertionRewriter handles certain types of data or expression evaluations. Given the description and the traceback, it's likely that the issue is not just limited to the AssertionRewriter class but could be related to how other parts of the pytest framework interact with it, especially during the module collection and import process. To address this, we should focus our search on the AssertionRewriter class and related functions across the relevant files. Additionally, we should also investigate other parts of the codebase that interact with the pytest collection and import mechanisms to ensure all types being handled are appropriate and safe for iteration.",

Given the description of the problem, where an integer is being treated as an iterable, it's plausible that the issue could be in how data types are handled during the import and collection phases of pytest. Thus, a broader search might be necessary to pinpoint where this conversion or misinterpretation is happening. Another possibility is that the error isn't directly in the code we've searched so far but in how certain files or tests are structured, leading to this Type Error when pytest attempts to process them.

To address this issue, it's crucial to identify where the docstring is being processed and determine if it's correctly differentiating between docstrings and numbers.
