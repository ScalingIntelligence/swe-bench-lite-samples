I need to investigate the `AssertionRewriter` class within the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file and look for any places where an integer might be incorrectly handled as a docstring. Additionally, I should examine the `collect` and `_importtestmodule` methods in `_pytest/python.py` for any handling of file content that might lead to this error.",

This issue seems to be related to the handling of docstrings during the assertion rewriting process. Specifically, the error `TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable` suggests that a code section expects a string (like a docstring) but encounters an integer instead. The search results reveal several key sections of pytest code that deal with collecting, importing, and rewriting tests. The most relevant file appears to be `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, specifically the `AssertionRewriter` class which is responsible for rewriting the assertions in test files. This class includes methods to process the module path, configuration, and source bytes during the rewriting process, which aligns with the reported issue. Additionally, `src/_pytest/python.py` contains the `Module` and `Package` classes that are critical for importing and collecting test modules, which are secondary areas related to the reported issue. Based on this analysis, the identified issue seems to be directly addressed by the code spans in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. Given that the reported issue is about the handling of docstrings and the TypeError encountered in the assertion-rewriting process, focusing on the `AssertionRewriter` class and its related methods offers a precise place to look for the cause and potential resolution of the issue.",

Specifically, the error is encountered in the `is_rewrite_disabled` method of the `AssertionRewriter` class, which checks if a docstring contains 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE'. The issue arises because an integer is being passed to this method instead of a string.\n\nGiven this context, it's crucial to inspect the `run` method of the `AssertionRewriter` class to understand where and how the docstring is being extracted and passed around. This method processes the module and its body, handling docstrings and deciding whether to rewrite asserts. The analysis of the `run` method shows that it handles docstrings from module bodies and checks if they should be considered for rewriting. The method also prepares imports for rewriting if necessary, indicating the need to further ensure that docstrings are handled correctly at this stage.\n\nThus, the primary focus should be on the `run` method of the `AssertionRewriter` class to ensure that docstrings are correctly obtained and handled. This method is found in the search results, making it directly relevant to addressing the reported issue.\n\nAdditionally, ensuring that docstrings are correctly identified and handled in other segments of the code can also be beneficial.

These methods handle the rewriting of assertions and check for markers within docstrings that prevent rewriting.

While there are other components in the pytest framework that could interact with these methods during test collection (such as the `collect` and `_importtestmodule` methods in `_pytest/python.py`), the direct code related to handling docstrings and rewriting assertions appears to be accounted for in the file context.

This indicates a possible issue with the handling of docstrings during the collection phase.

The provided file context includes relevant parts of `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` where the `AssertionRewriter` class is defined, particularly the `run` method which processes the initial part of the module's body to identify and potentially rewrite asserts. This method includes checks for docstrings, which are expected to be strings. The error in question points to the `is_rewrite_disabled` method, which expects a string argument to check for the presence of a specific marker. The issue suggests that an integer is being passed to this method instead of a string, leading to the TypeError. It appears that the relevant sections of code are provided to investigate this issue, including the handling of module body elements and the specific parsing of docstrings.
