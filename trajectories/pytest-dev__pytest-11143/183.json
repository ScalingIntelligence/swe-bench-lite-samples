The `AssertionRewriter` class's `run` method attempts to check if the rewrite is disabled by looking for the 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' marker within a docstring. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where the first item in the module body is a number, which leads to the reported TypeError. Thus, the relevant code to fix this issue is identified in the `run` method of the `AssertionRewriter` class, specifically where it checks the docstring. The provided code snippet confirms the existence of the potential error point in handling the first item as a docstring. However, it does not explicitly handle numbers differently, which is needed to resolve the issue.

The problem identified is that a number at the start of a file is being treated as a docstring, leading to a TypeError. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `run` method correctly identifies docstrings and does not mistakenly treat a number as a docstring. We also need to ensure that the `is_rewrite_disabled` method accurately checks for the presence of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in the docstring, which it currently does.
