The method expects the `docstring` to be a string, and the error indicates that an integer is being passed instead. This discrepancy suggests that there could be a logical error or an unexpected data input upstream from where the docstring is handled. To resolve this issue, I recommend adding type-checking mechanisms before the docstring is processed in the `is_rewrite_disabled` method.

This error arises in the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method, specifically where it checks for the presence of the string 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in the docstring. The issue can be traced back to the `run` method in the same class, where it attempts to handle the docstring. The provided code spans in the `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file seem relevant and cover the necessary methods and logic associated with assertion rewriting and docstring handling. Specifically, the `AssertionRewriter.run` method is responsible for the initial checks on the docstring and might be the point of failure if an unexpected type (like an integer) is encountered. The `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method is also pertinent as it directly involves the check that fails due to the incorrect type. Overall, the provided search results contain sufficient code spans to address the reported issue by examining and potentially modifying the logic for handling docstrings within the AssertionRewriter class.",

The method expects the `docstring` to be a string, and the error indicates that an integer is being passed instead. This discrepancy suggests that there could be a logical error or an unexpected data input upstream from where the docstring is handled. To resolve this issue, I recommend adding type-checking mechanisms before the docstring is processed in the `is_rewrite_disabled` method. This would help identify where the integer is being introduced as a docstring. Additionally, reviewing the extraction logic in the `run` method is crucial to ensure that only strings are assigned to the `doc` variable.",
