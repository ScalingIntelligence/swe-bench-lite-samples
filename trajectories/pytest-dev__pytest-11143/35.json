Therefore, the focus shifts to ensuring that the `mod` object passed to `AssertionRewriter.run` correctly sets its `docstring` attribute to a string, particularly in scenarios where the first item of the module body might be misinterpreted as a docstring due to some odd parsing issue.

The error described in the issue suggests a `TypeError` due to treating an integer as a string, likely occurring in this part of the code where the docstring is checked. Additionally, the `Module` class in `src/_pytest/python.py` handles importing test modules, which is another critical area related to the issue. However, the direct cause of the issue (treating a number as a docstring) is not explicitly identified in the provided context, suggesting that the exact code responsible for this behavior might be in another part of the codebase or in the test scripts themselves.

        "message": "The search returned 1 results. But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue concerns a TypeError that occurs when the first expression of a file is a number, which is mistaken as a docstring during the pytest rewrite process. This is likely due to the `is_rewrite_disabled` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class, which checks if the 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' string is present in the docstring. If the first expression is an integer (or any non-string type), it could cause the TypeError when the method attempts to check the membership of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE'. The existing code spans provided in the context already cover the relevant parts of the `AssertionRewriter` class. The new search results do not add any new relevant information, as they are primarily duplicates or unrelated to the issue at hand. Given the existing context and the redundant nature of the new search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans have already been identified and the search task is complete.",
