This error occurs in the collection phase when pytest attempts to rewrite assertions in the test module. Specifically, the error originates from the `_pytest.assertion.rewrite` module where the `is_rewrite_disabled` method tries to check for the string 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in the docstring. However, if the first expression in the file is a number, it is wrongly considered as a docstring, thereby causing the TypeError.\n\nThe relevant code spans from the search results that could be contributing to this issue are primarily in the `_pytest/python.py` file. The spans of interest include `Module._importtestmodule` where the test module is imported, `Module.collect` which handles the collection process, and `Module._inject_setup_module_fixture` where setup module fixtures are injected. Additionally, the `PyobjMixin.module` property could be of interest as it deals with getting the module object.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, it is likely that the issue could be resolved by improving how docstrings are handled or identified in the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file. However, the search results provided do not include this file directly, which suggests that further investigation is needed into that specific file to pinpoint the exact location of the erroneous handling of docstrings when a number is used.\n\nFor now, the identified spans from `_pytest/python.py` are the closest matches to the context of the reported issue, as they involve aspects of module importing, collection, and setup fixture injection, which could indirectly relate to how pytest handles docstrings and numbers at the beginning of files.",
