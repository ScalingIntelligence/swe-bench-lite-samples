This error occurs in the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method where it tries to check if 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is in the docstring, but the docstring is actually an integer. The provided code spans are all part of the `AssertionRewriter` class in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. Specifically, the `run` method is responsible for processing the module's body and checking the docstring. The `is_rewrite_disabled` method is called within the `run` method to check if the rewrite should be disabled based on the docstring. The issue seems to be that the code does not correctly handle cases where the docstring (or first expression) is not a string but an integer. Therefore, the relevant code spans should include the `run` method and the `is_rewrite_disabled` method to address this issue. No new relevant code spans were found in the search results that weren't already in the file context.",
