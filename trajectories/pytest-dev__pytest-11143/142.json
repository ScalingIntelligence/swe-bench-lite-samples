The relevant sections of the code involve functions and methods related to the assertion rewriting process in pytest. Specifically, the `AssertionRewriter.run` method checks if the docstring contains 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE', which raises a TypeError if the 'doc' is actually an integer rather than a string. This suggests that the issue lies within the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method where it tries to search for a substring in 'doc'. Therefore, the relevant spans to address this issue are those involving the `run` method in `AssertionRewriter` and possibly the `is_rewrite_disabled` method. Additionally, the `_rewrite_test` and `rewrite_asserts` functions are also relevant as they initiate the process of rewriting and involve handling the module's body and docstrings.",
