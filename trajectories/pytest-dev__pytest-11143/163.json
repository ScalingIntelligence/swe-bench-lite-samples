This issue is relevant to the `AssertionRewriter` class and its `is_rewrite_disabled` method in the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file.

The traceback provided points to a specific location in the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file in the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method, where a check for the presence of a specific string in the docstring is being performed. The Error (`TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable`) indicates that the code is trying to perform an iterable operation (most likely a containment check) on a variable (`docstring`) that is unexpectedly an integer rather than a string. The search results revealed additional methods in the `AssertionRewriter` class, such as `run`, `is_rewrite_disabled`, and various `visit_*` methods, which are pertinent to the issue as they involve the processing of the AST nodes, which likely include docstrings and other expressions. The key to resolving this issue would be ensuring that all nodes that potentially contain docstrings (or any attributes used by methods like `is_rewrite_disabled`) are correctly handled in and explicitly checked during various stages of the `run` method to avoid encountering integers where strings are expected.",
