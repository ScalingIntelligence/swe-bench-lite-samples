This error leads to a TypeError because the type 'int' is not iterable. The core problem seems to be in the `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` method, which expects a string but receives an integer, causing the 'in' operation to fail. The search results focus on the `AssertionRewriter` class in the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file, providing detailed methods that handle assertion rewriting. Additionally, other files like `_pytest/python.py` and `_pytest/pathlib.py` offer context on how files are imported and collected during testing, which could be indirectly related to the issue at hand. Given this information, the relevant code spans are primarily within the `AssertionRewriter` class, specifically focusing on the methods `is_rewrite_disabled`, `run`, and potentially how docstrings are extracted and handled in `run`.

However, the error indicates that an integer is being passed to `is_rewrite_disabled`, so we need to delve deeper into how `docstring` might be set or passed throughout the project. We will: 1.

This error happens during the assertion rewriting process in pytest. The relevant part of the codebase that needs to be examined is the AssertionRewriter class in the module src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py.\n\nThe error trace specifies that the TypeError occurs in the method 'is_rewrite_disabled' of the AssertionRewriter class, where it tries to check the presence of 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' in the docstring. The issue arises because the docstring is being treated as an integer, which is not iterable.\n\nGiven the context of the error and the provided search results, the relevant file is src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py. This file contains the AssertionRewriter class which has the method 'is_rewrite_disabled' that is causing the issue. Additionally, examining the method 'run' in the same class will provide more context on how the docstring is processed and potentially where the integer input is coming from.\n\nAdditional files listed in the search results, such as src/py.py, src/pytest/__main__.py, src/_pytest/doctest.py, src/_pytest/monkeypatch.py, src/pytest/__init__.py, and src/_pytest/python.py, do not directly relate to the assertion rewriting process or the handling of docstrings as specified in the error message. Therefore, they are not critical to the resolution of the reported issue.\n\nI have identified the relevant file (src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py) and the specific sections of code ('AssertionRewriter.run' and 'AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled') that are most pertinent to the reported issue.
