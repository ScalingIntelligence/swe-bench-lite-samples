The error message `TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable` suggests that somewhere in the process, an integer is being treated as a string or iterable object where it shouldn't be. This likely happens during the collection phase when pytest tries to import and rewrite test modules. It's possible that the first expression in the file is being incorrectly interpreted as a docstring because it's a number. This could be caught and handled more gracefully in the pytest rewrite logic. To address this, it would be beneficial to focus on the `assertion/rewrite.py` file and the `rewrite_asserts` function, as well as any related functions that check for or manipulate docstrings. Additionally, checking the preprocessing or interpretation of the first line in a test file might reveal where the incorrect assignment of a number to a docstring is occurring.",

This error happens during the assertion rewriting process in pytest. The error traceback points to the `is_rewrite_disabled` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class, where it tries to check if 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is in the docstring. The issue arises because the docstring is mistakenly treated as an integer. From the provided code span in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, it's clear that the `AssertionRewriter` class and its `run` method are involved in the assertion rewriting process. The `run` method checks if the docstring disables rewrite, which suggests that handling and verifying the docstring properly could resolve the issue.

It checks if the first item in the module's body is an expression containing a constant (which could be a string or a number), and treats it as a docstring if it expects a docstring and the item is an instance of `ast.Expr` containing an `ast.Constant`. A crucial improvement could be added to check the type of the constant more strictly to ensure it is indeed a string before treating it as a docstring.

This function expects a string but encounters an integer, leading to the TypeError.

These methods are crucial for understanding how the `AssertionRewriter` class initializes and checks docstrings to determine if assertion rewriting should be disabled.
