Specifically, the error occurs in the evaluation of the coth function for certain values of x, and it relates to a NameError indicating that 'cotm' is not defined. This error points to a potential issue in the coth.eval method within the hyperbolic.py file. Upon reviewing the coth.eval method in the provided search results, it becomes clear that the method attempts to use 'cotm' without defining it, which is likely the source of the error. Additionally, the trigonometric.py file includes the cot function, which may be relevant to understanding how the coth function interacts with trigonometric functions or how the error might propagate. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans are in the hyperbolic.py file where the coth.eval method is defined, and possibly in the trigonometric.py file where the cot function and its substitution behavior are defined.",

The problem occurs when substituting specific integral values into the expression, leading to a NameError due to 'cotm' not being defined. We should focus on the 'coth' and 'tan' functions in the hyperbolic.py file as well as any potential references to 'cot' in the trigonometric.py file.\n\nReviewing the previous context, we see that the file 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' contains relevant functions like 'tanh' and 'coth'. We can extract code spans related to these functions' evaluation methods. The 'coth.eval' method is particularly relevant, as it checks for specific conditions and could be where the NameError originates.\n\nIn the new search results, the 'coth.eval' method again appears, confirming our direction. We need to pay attention to how 'coth' handles specific numeric substitutions and any potential undefined variables like 'cotm', which should be referenced or defined to avoid future errors.\n\nThe 'coth.eval' method not only handles numeric conditions but also converts the argument into different forms, such as imaginary coefficients or added terms. It's crucial to ensure that all conversion paths are correctly managed and do not lead to undefined states.\n\nSince 'cotm' is mentioned in the initial context within the 'coth.eval' method, and not defined, this seems to be the direct cause of the error. We should ensure that 'cotm', if used, is appropriately defined or referenced in both the hyperbolic and trigonometric file contexts.\n\nBased on this analysis, we must include the 'coth.eval' function span from both the initial context and new search results to fully address the issue. Additionally, we may need to expand the scope if further connections between 'coth' and 'cot' (from trigonometric functions) are found to resolve all relevant undefined variable issues.",

The evaluation of cot in 'trigonometric.py' confirms that it handles cases similar to those in hyperbolic functions like coth.
