To address this, the following steps were taken: 1. Identify the file containing the `coth` function - `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`. 2. Locate the relevant code spans in the `coth` class, including the `eval` method where the error occurs and any related methods that could influence the behavior for the specified values of x. 3. The `eval` method contains logic to handle different types of arguments and their transformations. It checks for specific conditions such as complex infinity and handles additions and functions like `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`, and `acoth`. Importantly, the error arises because the variable 'cotm' is used without being defined within the method. This suggests an oversight or bug in the code.",
