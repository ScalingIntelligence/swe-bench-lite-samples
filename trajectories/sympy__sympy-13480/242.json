The search results bring up the 'coth' class within the hyperbolic.py file of the sympy project. This class contains the 'eval' method, which is likely where the error is occurring based on the traceback provided. The 'eval' method is responsible for evaluating the coth function for different types of arguments, including handling specific cases such as when the argument is a complex infinity or part of an addition. It also checks if the argument is a number or involves trigonometric functions. Given the reference to 'cotm' in the error message, it looks like the issue might be related to how the 'coth' function handles specific mathematical operations or internal function calls within its evaluation.
