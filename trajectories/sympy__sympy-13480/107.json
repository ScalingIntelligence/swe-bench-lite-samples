However, the variable 'cotm' is indeed not defined within the context provided.\n\nIn the search results, the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file contains the implementation of the trigonometric functions, including `tan` and `cot`. The `tan.eval` and `cot.eval` methods are of particular interest as they handle the evaluation of tangent and cotangent functions, respectively. These functions are likely to be used within the `coth` function, especially given the expression `coth(log(tan(x)))`. The `cot` class and its `eval` method contain logic similar to what might be needed within the `coth` evaluation, especially in handling cases involving `ComplexInfinity` and direct evaluations of arguments.\n\nGiven the reported issue and the context of the code, the relevant code spans include the `cot` class and its `eval` method from the `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` file.
