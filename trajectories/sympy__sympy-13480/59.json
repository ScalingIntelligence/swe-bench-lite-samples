The error occurs specifically in the coth.eval method due to an undefined variable 'cotm'. Reviewing the current file context, it was noted that no relevant code was identified yet. In the new search results, I focused on analyzing the coth class and its eval method in the file 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py'. The relevant code spans include the import statements, the definition of the coth class, and particularly the coth.eval method where the error occurs. Additionally, since the issue involves tan(x) within the expression, I also considered the tan class and its eval method from the file 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' as potentially relevant for understanding and fixing the issue. The 'cot' class from the trigonometric file was also briefly considered but did not directly contain code relevant to the error.",
