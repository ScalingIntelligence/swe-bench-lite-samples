The stack trace points to a `NameError` in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` where the variable 'cotm' is referenced but not defined. Given this context, the search should focus on the `coth` function's `eval` method within `hyperbolic.py` as the potential source of the error, and ensure that related functions like `tan` and `cot` are correctly handled. Specific focus should be on the `eval` method of the `coth` class to correct the undefined 'cotm'.",

Since 'cotm' is not defined in the context where it's used, it indicates a possible typo or an incomplete implementation. To address this, further investigation is needed into the `eval` method of the `coth` class and related functions like `tan` and `tanh`. We should broaden our search to include the broader context of hyperbolic and trigonometric functions to understand the interaction and handling of nested expressions. Additionally, we should look into the `log` function's evaluation as it is part of the nested expression `coth(log(tan(x)))`. Thus, we need to search across relevant files that contain implementations of these functions to identify where the issue with 'cotm' could arise.",

Specifically, the error is a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `cotm` in the `coth.eval` method. To address this, I need to find the relevant code spans that handle the evaluation of `coth` and `tan`, particularly where they interact with `log`. The search results provide several spans in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`. Key spans to focus on include the `coth.eval` method where the error occurs and the `tan.eval` method where the transformation of `tan` into other functions might happen. Additionally, the `imports` span in both files outlines the imported modules and functions which could aid in understanding the context and dependencies. Other spans related to `coth` and `tan` provide additional evaluation and transformation methods, which could also be relevant. The `coth.eval` method specifically deals with numerical evaluations, which is directly related to the reported issue.",
