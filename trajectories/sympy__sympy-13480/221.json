The relevant part of the codebase is within the `coth` class located in 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py'. The specific section that needs review is the `eval` method of the `coth` class since it handles the evaluation logic of the coth function and contains the error-prone condition checking 'if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity'. It's clear that the variable `cotm` is being used without being defined, which is the root cause of the issue.
