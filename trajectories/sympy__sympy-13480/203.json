Specifically, the line 'if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity:' suggests that 'cotm' is intended to be a variable related to the cotangent function. Since the error indicates that 'cotm' is not defined, it is crucial to also look for the code span where 'cotm' might be defined or used. The search results include the eval method of the cot class in the trigonometric.py file, which could be related to 'cotm'. Additionally, the eval method of the tan class in the same file is relevant because tan(x) is involved in the log(tan(x)) expression inside coth. These code spans should provide a comprehensive context to understand and resolve the issue.",
