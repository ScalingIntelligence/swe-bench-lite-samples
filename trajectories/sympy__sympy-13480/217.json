Also, since the error occurs during substitution with `x = 2`, it might be helpful to look into the `_eval_subs` method in `trigonometric.py`.",

Recognize that the variable 'cotm' should not be present directly but rather should check for 'cothm' instead, assuming 'cothm' was intended to be checked against 'S.ComplexInfinity'.\n5.
