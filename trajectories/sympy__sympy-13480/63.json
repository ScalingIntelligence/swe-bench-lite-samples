The traceback indicates that a `NameError` occurs due to the undefined variable `cotm` inside the `eval` method of the `coth` class. This suggests a potential issue in the evaluation logic of the `coth` function or a missing initialization of the `cotm` variable. To address this, we should focus our search on the `hyperbolic.py` file, specifically lines related to the `coth` class and its `eval` method. Additionally, the issue involves trigonometric functions and their hyperbolic counterparts, so it wouldn't hurt to also include the `trigonometric.py` file for broader context.",
