The error specifically occurs at the line where 'cotm' is referenced. This error is observed for specific values such as 2, 3, 5, and others.\n\nIn examining the search results, the file 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' contains the definition of the 'coth' function and its evaluation method ('coth.eval'). This evaluation method includes handling for several conditions, including when the argument is an addition or when it matches specific function forms like asinh, acosh, atanh, and acoth. The problematic section where 'cotm' is supposed to be defined is found here, which likely contributes to the observed issue with .subs method.\n\nAdditionally, the 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' file defines the 'tan' function, which could be related to the internal computations of 'tan(x)' within the 'coth(log(tan(x)))' expression. The 'tan' function and its evaluation method ('tan.eval') are found here, detailing its behavior for various input types, including when the argument is a multiplication of S.Pi and certain coefficients.\n\nThese findings indicate that the relevant code spans that could be directly influencing the issue are in both the 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' and 'sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py' files. The first file leads to the precise location of the error, while the second hints at the preliminary process before the problematic step.",
