Within this method, the error occurs at the line where 'cotm is S.ComplexInfinity'. This suggests that 'cotm' is expected to be defined at some point in the method but isn't. The method also references other parts of the code like 'tanh' and 'cos', though these don't directly relate to the issue at hand.\n\nThe code spans identified should focus on the 'coth' class and its 'eval' method.

The new search results reduplicate some of the code spans from the file context, particularly focusing on the coth.eval method, which is likely where the error is occurring. The key elements to focus on are the eval methods for coth and tanh, as they handle the evaluation of these functions, and any potential issues within these methods could lead to the observed error. The relevance of the search results lies in their alignment with the reported issue's focus on the coth function and its evaluation method.
