The error message points to a `NameError` related to the variable `cotm` in the `eval` method of the `coth` class. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the `coth` function interacts with other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, especially `tan` and `cot`. The relevant files identified so far include `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, focusing on the `tan`, `cot`, and `coth` classes. The search should focus on these classes and their methods, especially `eval`, to find the root cause of the `NameError`.",
