This is critical for the `identity` property which uses a tuple including `through_fields`. The error occurs because `through_fields` can sometimes be a list, making it unhashable. The search should focus on the `ManyToManyRel` class within the Django ORM, specifically looking for instances where `through_fields` is used and `make_hashable` is not applied. Given the stack trace and the context provided, the focus should be on the file `reverse_related.py`. However, since the `ManyToManyRel` class extends `ForeignObjectRel`, it could also be relevant to check the superclass for methods related to hashing or identity.",

The `identity` property directly uses `self.through_fields` without conversion, which aligns with the reported issue. Additionally, the search results do not include any utility functions named `make_hashable`, suggesting that the `make_hashable` function might be part of the internal Django framework or needs to be implemented. Given the current context and search results, the relevant code spans are those that involve the `ManyToManyRel` class and its attributes, particularly `through_fields`.
