Given the stack trace and the description, we need to focus on the `ManyToManyRel` class and its related methods, especially those handling `identity` and `through_fields`. The error specifically points to the `__hash__` method in `reverse_related.py`, which is likely where the fix needs to be applied. We should also consider the `ManyToManyField` class in `related.py` as it relates directly to the issue.",

The traceback indicates a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` when trying to hash the `identity` property, which includes `through_fields`. The relevant code spans are in the `ManyToManyRel` class, specifically the `__init__` method where `through_fields` is assigned and the `identity` property where it is used. Identifying these spans is crucial to understand and fix the issue. The additional files and classes are related to the broader context of how ManyToMany relationships are handled, such as the `ManyToManyField` class and related functions, which help in understanding the overall structure but are not directly causing the issue.",
