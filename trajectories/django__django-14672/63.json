This argument needs to be made hashable, likely within or just before the '__init__' method. Interestingly, the implementation of the 'identity' property in `ManyToManyRel` combines several attributes, including `through_fields`, into a tuple for the 'identity' property where they can be hashed. Hence, it's reasonable to add the call to `make_hashable` for `through_fields` just before its usage in the tuple created in the 'identity' property. If 'make_hashable' is available from 'django.utils.hashable', it could be used here, or we need to define such a utility for better manageability and utility across such cases.",
