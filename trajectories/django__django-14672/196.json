The provided search results reveal relevant code spans in `ManyToManyRel` and its parent class `ForeignObjectRel`. Specifically, the `identity` property in `ManyToManyRel` and `ForeignObjectRel` are key as they construct the tuple that includes `through_fields` and `limit_choices_to`, respectively. Notably, `ForeignObjectRel` already uses `make_hashable` on `limit_choices_to`, suggesting a straightforward approach to apply the same mechanism to `through_fields` in `ManyToManyRel`.
