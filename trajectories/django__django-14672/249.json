The new search results contain additional related code spans including the `identity` property and `get_related_field` method within `ManyToManyRel`. According to the issue, `through_fields` can be a list and needs to be hashable. The provided search results show that `through_fields` is part of the `identity` property tuple which is used in the `__hash__` method. This confirms that `through_fields` indeed needs to be hashable to prevent the `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` during hashing.
