This issue is particularly problematic when dealing with proxy models. On analyzing the provided search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans involve the `ManyToManyField` class and its initialization method `__init__`. The `through_fields` parameter is handled here without any call to `make_hashable`. Additionally, the `ManyToManyRel` class, which is the relationship descriptor for many-to-many fields, should be investigated to see where `through_fields` might get processed without this required call. Given the detailed description and the specific focus on `through_fields`, the current search results align well with the issue, suggesting that the immediate next step should be to implement the missing `make_hashable` call within the `ManyToManyField`'s initialization or in `ManyToManyRel` to handle `through_fields` appropriately. Additionally, considering the issue's manifestation specifically with proxy models, a deeper check into the handling of proxy models within these code spans could also be beneficial.",
