This is relevant because `through_fields` can be a list, and without `make_hashable`, the `identity` property which includes `through_fields` in its tuple, can fail when trying to hash it, especially when working with proxy models. I examined the provided code spans to identify where this could be addressed. The `ManyToManyRel.identity` property is where `through_fields` is included in the tuple that gets hashed, and there's no evidence of a call to `make_hashable` at this point. This confirms the issue reported. Furthermore, the `ManyToManyField` class and its `__init__` method suggest a clear pathway for modifying the `ManyToManyRel` class to include a call to `make_hashable` on `through_fields`, ensuring they are always hashable before being included in the `identity` tuple. I considered other parts of the codebase referred to in the search results to be relevant context but not directly the site of the bug or its solution.",
