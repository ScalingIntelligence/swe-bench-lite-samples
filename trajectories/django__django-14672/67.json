  "initial_message": "Missing call `make_hashable` on `through_fields` in `ManyToManyRel`\nDescription\n\t\nIn 3.2 identity property has been added to all ForeignObjectRel to make it possible to compare them. A hash is derived from said identity and it's possible because identity is a tuple. To make limit_choices_to hashable (one of this tuple elements), \u200bthere's a call to make_hashable.\nIt happens that through_fields can be a list. In such case, this make_hashable call is missing in \u200bManyToManyRel.\nFor some reason it only fails on checking proxy model.
