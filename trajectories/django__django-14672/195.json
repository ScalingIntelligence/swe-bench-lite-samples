This causes a `TypeError` when attempting to hash `through_fields` if it is a list. Given the error trace and description, the focus should be on the `ManyToManyRel` class and its `identity` property, as well as the `through_fields` handling within the `ManyToManyField` class. The search should initially target these classes and methods to locate the exact code snippet where `make_hashable` should be added.",

This function is crucial for ensuring that `through_fields`, which can be a list, is hashable, thus allowing comparison and identity operations. The issue arises when `through_fields` is a list and not a tuple. The error occurs during the hashing process, where `through_fields` is expected to be hashable but isn't. The search results provide the relevant code spans in `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related.py`. Specifically, the `ManyToManyRel` class in `reverse_related.py` is responsible for handling many-to-many relationships and needs to ensure that `through_fields` is appropriately converted to a hashable type if it is a list. The `ManyToManyField` class in `related.py` initializes and checks the many-to-many fields, including handling `through_fields`. Additional code spans in `related.py` show various checks and initializations related to `ManyToManyField`, which are also relevant as they show how `through_fields` is managed and validated. The identified code spans are sufficient to address the reported issue, as they cover the initialization, handling, and checking of `through_fields`.",
