This suggests that the `make_hashable` call is missing in the class. A search should be conducted for the `ManyToManyRel` class, focusing on areas where `through_fields` is processed. Additionally, the issue involves proxy models, indicating a specific scenario impacting model validation in Django. Given the detailed error stack, it is clear that the error occurs during the check process, specifically within the `_check_field_name_clashes` and `__hash__` methods. Thus, searching for these methods and the `ManyToManyRel` class should help locate the relevant code.",

From this, it is clear the issue pertains to the 'make_hashable' function call being absent from 'through_fields' in 'ManyToManyRel'. Judging by the provided file (django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py), the ForeignObjectRel class precedes the ManyToManyRel class. Both contribute to the identity implementation. The ManyToManyRel class specifically is where we expect to identify missing implementation for handling list types of the through_fields property. Further digging shows the 'make_hashable' utility imported in 'django/db/models/base.py'. The rest of the search results cover diverse Django aspects and functionalities; but all relating back to specifics of the reported issue with '__hash__' related implementations, underscoring its generic nature. This scenario reiterates the importance of a foolproof check while integrating widespread django components like ForeignKey and ManyToManyField to enhance reliability.\n\n Through keen analysis of the reported issue outlining missing calls to 'make_hashable' on 'through_fields' in 'ManyToManyRel', this aligns with my findings: 'make_hashable' not being invoked on 'through_fields' in the ManyToManyRel initialization. The issue is specifically rooted in Django's consistency and data integrity in handling M2M field with a through model in proxy models. The relevant code spans confirm that during initialization of ManyToManyRel, 'self.through_fields' is set without ensuring its hashability which is critical for identity derivation. So, these spans clearly justify needed adjustments to include the said 'make_hashable' invocation and thus, resolve the issue.",

This omission is causing the `TypeError` because `through_fields` can sometimes be a list, which is unhashable. The solution proposed in the issue description, to add a call to `make_hashable` on `through_fields` in `ManyToManyRel`, is likely the correct approach to ensure that `through_fields` is always hashable before inclusion in the `identity` tuple. Since the current codespan does not include such a call and the search results did not yield a relevant implementation of `make_hashable`, further direct changes to the `ManyToManyRel` class are needed to resolve this issue.",
