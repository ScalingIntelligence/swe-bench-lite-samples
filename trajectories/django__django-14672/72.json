This is causing a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` when trying to hash the identity of `ManyToManyRel` instances. The issue is particularly problematic with proxy models, which have more checks. From the search results, we can see the `ManyToManyRel` class definition and the `identity` property where the `through_fields` are included in the tuple. However, there is no call to `make_hashable` within the `ManyToManyRel` class or its methods.\n\nTo address the issue, we need to identify the exact spot where the `make_hashable` call should be added. Based on the code provided, the `identity` property is the likely place where the `through_fields` need to be made hashable. However, the current code does not include any function named `make_hashable`, so we assume it is a function that needs to be called to convert `through_fields` to a hashable type if it is a list. The relevant spans of code are those where `through_fields` is initialized and used in the `identity` property. Specifically, the `__init__` method and the `identity` property are the relevant spans, as these are the places where `through_fields` is set and used respectively. Therefore, these spans need to be modified to include the `make_hashable` call, either directly or by ensuring `through_fields` is always converted to a hashable type before being used.",
