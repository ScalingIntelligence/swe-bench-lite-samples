The search results contain the relevant code spans within the 'ManyToManyRel' class, including the '__init__' method where 'through_fields' is initialized, the 'identity' property where 'through_fields' is used, and the 'get_related_field' method as context. These spans are directly related to the issue at hand, especially the initialization and usage of 'through_fields'.

However, there's no explicit call to `make_hashable` on `self.through_fields` to ensure it's hashable if it's a list. The `make_hashable` function in `django/utils/hashable.py` could be used to convert unhashable types like lists into hashable tuples. Currently, the code does not address this directly, potentially leading to the mentioned `TypeError` when `through_fields` is a list. The necessary alteration appears to be adding a call to `make_hashable` for `self.through_fields` within the `identity` property to guarantee its hashability. Given the context provided, while the necessary code for resolving the issue (by including a call to `make_hashable`) is identified, it's not yet implemented in the code snippets provided. More context is needed to see if there are additional utility functions or methods interacting with `through_fields` or the `identity` property.",
