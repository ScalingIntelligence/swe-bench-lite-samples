This is causing a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` when `through_fields` is a list due to the lack of processing to make it hashable. From the provided stack trace, it's evident that the error occurs in the `ManyToManyRel` class's `__hash__` method when attempting to hash `self.identity`, which includes `through_fields`. The solution is straightforward: add the missing `make_hashable` call on `self.through_fields` in the `ManyToManyRel` class. However, the specific location of this change is not immediately obvious from the provided files, and no specific code spans have been identified yet. Therefore, our initial search parameters will focus on the `ManyToManyRel` class in the 'django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py' file, based on the given context.",
