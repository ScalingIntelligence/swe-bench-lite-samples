Given the error and the stack trace in the issue, it is evident that the `through_fields` could possibly be a list, which is not hashable. This property needs to be properly managed, presumably with the function `make_hashable`. The search should focus on the `ManyToManyRel` class within the `reverse_related.py` file since this class has an `identity` property, likely where the hash is derived. Additionally, the related field might be involved in the `ManyToManyField` class definition within `related.py`. Therefore, the search will be directed to find any occurrences mentioning `through_fields`, the `ManyToManyRel` class, and its methods where this problem could occur.",

It's clear from the `identity` property of this class that it's meant to combine several fields into a hashable tuple. However, since `through_fields` can sometimes be a list, as mentioned in the issue, it could not be included directly in the identity tuple without potentially causing an error. To solve this, the implementation needs to make sure that `through_fields` is transformed into a hashable form before inclusion. Since `make_hashable` is already used for the `limit_choices_to` field in the `ForeignObjectRel` class, it should likely be used for `through_fields` in `ManyToManyRel` as well to ensure consistency and prevent type errors. Moreover, from the code in the `ManyToManyField` class in `related.py`, it appears that it initializes its relationship using the `ManyToManyRel` class constructor, which includes `through_fields`, underscoring its potential to be a list and thus needing this safeguard.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue highlights the need for a missing call to `make_hashable` on `through_fields` in the `ManyToManyRel` class. This is crucial for ensuring that the `through_fields` can be hashed and used within the identity tuple. The current context already provides the `ManyToManyRel` class and its `identity` property, which does not include the `make_hashable` call for `through_fields`. The new search results do not add any further relevant code related to this issue. The task is complete as the relevant code spans have been identified in the current context.",
