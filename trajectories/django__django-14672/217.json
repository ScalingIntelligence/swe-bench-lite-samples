To resolve this, we need to identify the code span where `through_fields` is used within `ManyToManyRel` and ensure that `make_hashable` is called on it.\n\nUpon examining the `search_results`, we find that the relevant code spans are within the `ManyToManyRel` class:\n\n1. The `__init__` method, where `through_fields` is initialized.\n2. The `identity` property definition, where `through_fields` is part of the tuple returned by the property.\n\nThese two spans should be selected as they are directly related to the handling and usage of `through_fields` in `ManyToManyRel`. Additionally, the issue's solution suggests adding the missing call to `make_hashable` within these spans to resolve the unhashable type error.\n\nThus, the search task for the relevant code spans can be considered complete as we have identified the specific parts of the code that need modification to incorporate the `make_hashable` call on `through_fields`.",
