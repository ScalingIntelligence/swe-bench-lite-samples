The solution is to add the missing `make_hashable` call. \n\nIn examining the search results, the relevant code spans are found within the `ManyToManyRel` class. Specifically, the constructor `__init__` and the `identity` property are identified. The constructor initializes `through_fields` but does not make it hashable as required by the issue. The `identity` property uses `through_fields` in its computation without ensuring its hashability. These sections of code directly address the issue at hand and need to be modified to include the missing `make_hashable` call.",
