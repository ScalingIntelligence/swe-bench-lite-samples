The issue specifically points out that `through_fields` can be a list, which causes a `TypeError` because lists are unhashable. The solution provided suggests adding the missing `make_hashable` call on `self.through_fields` in the `ManyToManyRel` class.\n\nReviewing the search results, it's evident that the relevant code spans are in the `ManyToManyRel` class definition. Specifically, the span containing the `identity` property method would need to be modified to include the `make_hashable` call on `self.through_fields`. This change is critical for ensuring that the `identity` tuple is composed of hashable elements, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.\n\nThe identified code span in the `identity` property is crucial because it directly relates to constructing the `identity` tuple used in hash calculations. Addressing this span is necessary to implement the solution as described in the reported issue.",
