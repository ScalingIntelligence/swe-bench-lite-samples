The `ManyToManyRel` class definition, its `__init__` method, the `identity` property, and the `get_related_field` method are all pertinent to the issue at hand. Specifically, the `identity` property is where the `through_fields` is used, and it needs to be made hashable to avoid TypeError. This suggests that the `make_hashable` call should be added where `through_fields` is initialized or used. Since the `identity` property should return a hashable type, ensuring `through_fields` is hashable before it's included in the identity tuple is crucial. Even though the exact call to `make_hashable` is not present in the provided code spans, understanding the context and requirements from the issue report leads to the conclusion that modifications should primarily focus around the `ManyToManyRel` class's handling of `through_fields`.",
