This is critical because `through_fields` can be a list, which is unhashable and causes a `TypeError`. The solution provided suggests adding this missing call to ensure that `through_fields` is hashable. Reviewing the code spans in `reverse_related.py`, I found the class `ManyToManyRel` and its methods `__init__` and `identity`. The `through_fields` attribute is initialized in `__init__` and used in the `identity` property. Currently, `make_hashable` is not called on `through_fields` in either method, which directly addresses the reported issue. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to the issue and should be modified to include the missing `make_hashable` call.",
