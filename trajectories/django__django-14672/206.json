This omission leads to a `TypeError` when `through_fields` is a list and is part of the 'identity' tuple, which is used in the hash function. The search results show the current implementation of the `ManyToManyRel` class with its `__init__` and `identity` methods. The `__init__` method sets up the `through_fields` attribute, but there is no mention or call to `make_hashable`. The `identity` property uses `through_fields` directly in its tuple, which could potentially include lists if `through_fields` is not properly hashable. Thus, the relevant code spans are the `__init__` and `identity` methods in the `ManyToManyRel` class where modifications are needed to include a call to `make_hashable` on `through_fields`to ensure that the 'identity' property tuple includes only hashable types.",

The `through_fields` attribute, which can be a list, should be converted to a hashable format using `make_hashable`. This is necessary because the `identity` property, used for hashing in the `__hash__` method, includes `through_fields`.\n\nI then searched for the definition of `make_hashable` in the provided search results and found it in `django/utils/hashable.py`. The function `make_hashable` is designed to handle various types, converting them into a hashable form, which is exactly what is needed to resolve the issue with the unhashable `through_fields`.\n\nFinally, I identified two files where the fix should be applied: `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` for the `ManyToManyRel` class and `django/utils/hashable.py` for the `make_hashable` function. This alignment ensures that the relevant code spans are correctly identified to address the reported issue.",
