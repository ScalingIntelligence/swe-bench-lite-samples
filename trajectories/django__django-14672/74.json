            "scratch_pad": "The provided file context includes the definition of `ManyToManyRel` and the `make_hashable` function, which are critical for resolving the reported issue. The `ManyToManyRel` class is shown to initialize and use `self.through_fields` directly in its `identity` property. The missing `make_hashable` call on `self.through_fields` could be addressed by applying `make_hashable` to `self.through_fields` before including it in the `identity` tuple. The `make_hashable` function is provided in the context, suggesting that the utility for converting `through_fields` to a hashable type is available. To fully resolve the issue, a modification to ensure `self.through_fields` is made hashable before use in the `identity` property is necessary. However, since this specific modification is not part of the provided context but is implied by the content, the task can be considered complete based on the identification of relevant code locations and functions.",
