        "message": "The initial search did not yield any relevant results regarding the definition of `make_hashable`. Given this outcome, a broader or alternative approach to address the issue is necessary. Since the primary objective remains ensuring that `through_fields` in the `ManyToManyRel` class can be hashed, even if `make_hashable` is not explicitly defined or found, we can implement a similar function or an ad hoc solution within or closely related to the `ManyToManyRel` class to handle the conversion of lists to tuples or some other hashable form.\n\nHere's an idea: Implement a method within the `ManyToManyRel` class to perform the conversion. This method should check if `self.through_fields` is a list, and if so, convert it to a tuple. The existing `identity` property can be modified to call this new conversion method before calculating the hash.\n\nThis approach ensures that regardless of the initial form of `self.through_fields`, it is converted to a hashable type before being used for hashing purposes.",
