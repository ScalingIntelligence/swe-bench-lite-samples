This suggests that the issue might be related to how Django handles filtering on fields that are marked as non-filterable. By examining the provided search results from 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', I identified that the method 'build_filter' and the integration of 'check_filterable' might be pivotal points of analysis. The 'build_filter' method includes a 'check_filterable' call for 'reffed_expression' and 'value', which aligns with the issue description and could lead to the NotSupportedError being raised. This method stands out as particularly relevant to the issue, as modifying or addressing the 'check_filterable' functionality could potentially resolve the reported error. Therefore, the relevant code spans seem to be those that encompass the 'check_filterable' call within the 'build_filter' method.",
