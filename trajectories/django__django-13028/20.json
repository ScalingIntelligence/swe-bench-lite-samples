The issue involves models with fields labeled 'filterable', and specific error handling in the Query class. The search results include various files related to Django's ORM and admin functionalities, which could be relevant. I focused on identifying code spans related to the Query class and the check_filterable method, as well as any model-related code where the 'filterable' attribute might be defined or handled. Notably, the search results include files such as 'django/db/models/query.py', 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', 'django/db/models/base.py', and 'django/apps/registry.py', which are central to the issue's context. I also looked for any admin-related configurations that might interact with these models or their fields.\n\nBased on the analysis, I identified several key code spans in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' and 'django/db/models/query.py' that are directly related to the Query class and its handling of filterable attributes, which align with the reported issue. Additionally, model base and options classes in 'django/db/models/base.py' and 'django/db/models/options.py' could be relevant for understanding how 'filterable' fields are managed in models. I chose these spans as they directly deal with the query construction and model field handling, especially those related to filterability.",

Therefore, the primary focus should be on the `Query` class and its `check_filterable` method, and how fields like `filterable` might interact with this mechanism. The new search results confirm the presence of the `QuerySet.filter` method and the `Query.check_filterable` method, which are highly relevant to the issue at hand. The `QuerySet.__init__` and `Query.__init__` methods are also relevant as they initialize the objects used in these methods.
