The error is triggered when filtering the ProductMetaData model based on a related field 'metadata_type', which references the ProductMetaDataType model. The ProductMetaDataType model has a Boolean field 'filterable' that defaults to False. The error message indicates that a model or attribute is disallowed in the filter clause, potentially due to the 'filterable' field's attribute being marked as non-filterable. This points to a need to investigate how Django's query system handles filtering conditions, particularly in relationships between models and how fields might be marked or handled differently under certain conditions. The key files to focus on are those related to queryset logic, model management, and field handling in Django's ORM. The error could be coming from a check within the build_filter method in the query class or related methods that handle field attributes and their filterability.",
