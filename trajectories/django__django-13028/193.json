This error is directly related to the 'check_filterable' method in Django's 'Query' class within the 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' file. The method 'check_filterable' explicitly raises this error if the 'filterable' attribute of the expression is 'False'. To address this issue, Django's 'Query' class logic needs to be examined, particularly the 'check_filterable' and 'build_filter' methods. The 'check_filterable' method is crucial because it checks if an expression is allowed in the filter clause and raises the error if it is not. The 'build_filter' method, on the other hand, builds the filter expression and calls 'check_filterable' to ensure the filter expression is valid. Both methods are relevant to understanding and potentially fixing this issue. No other files are needed as the issue is specific to Django's query handling.",
