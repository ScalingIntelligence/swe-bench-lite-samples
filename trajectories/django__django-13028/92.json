The error traceback points to a method in Django's ORM handling the filtering process. To address this, we should investigate the specific part of Django's ORM that triggers this error when dealing with filterable fields. Given the traceback, it's clear that the error occurs in the filtering logic of the Django ORM. Focusing on the 'build_filter' and 'check_filterable' methods within Django's query.py is crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue. Additionally, since the error specifically mentions 'NotSupportedError', it may be beneficial to look into how Django handles field filtering constraints and validations.",

The traceback indicates that the error occurs in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, specifically in the `check_filterable` method. This method is responsible for checking if an expression can be used in the filter clause and raises the `NotSupportedError` if the expression is not filterable. This is consistent with the error message seen in the traceback, which states that 'ProductMetaDataType is disallowed in the filter clause'. The search results indeed contain the relevant sections of Django's query module for this functionality, specifically the `Query.check_filterable` and `Query.build_filter` methods. These methods are crucial to understand where the check for filterable fields is implemented in Django and how the error is triggered. Therefore, both code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue.\n\nThe identified code spans can be used to further investigate and potentially modify the system to handle the `filterable` attribute correctly. They also provide insights into how to avoid the error by ensuring that fields intended to be filterable are properly marked as such. Additionally, understanding the `build_filter` method can help in diagnosing how filters are constructed and applied in Django, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Therefore, these code spans should be included in the identification process.",
