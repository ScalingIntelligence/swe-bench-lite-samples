The reported error indicates that the check_filterable method is raising the NotSupportedError. This method is likely located in the Query class or in a method called by build_filter, which constructs the filters for the query. Upon reviewing the code spans in the search results, I found relevant sections in the Query class: 1) The build_filter method, which calls self.check_filterable(reffed_expression) and self.check_filterable(value). This method is directly involved in constructing filters for the query and is where the filterability check would be relevant. 2) The Query.__init__ method, which initializes the Query object and sets up various attributes needed for constructing the query, although less directly related to the issue, it provides context on how the Query object is structured and what attributes are involved. Based on these observations, I will mark the build_filter method and relevant calls to check_filterable as relevant spans for the reported issue.",

The error occurs when attempting to filter `ProductMetaData` with a `metadata_type` attribute. The relevant part of the codebase appears to be in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, especially the `build_filter` method, which checks if a field is filterable. This method calls `check_filterable` and raises a `NotSupportedError` if the field is not filterable. This aligns with the error described in the issue. The provided search results include this relevant method, which allows me to identify the exact code spans related to the issue. Other search results, like those in `django/contrib/admin/filters.py` and `django/db/models/query.py`, do not directly relate to the filterability issue at hand. Therefore, the identified spans in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` are pertinent and sufficient to address the reported issue.",
