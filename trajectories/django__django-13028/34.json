The user is migrating to Django 3.0.7 and encountering this error while filtering ProductMetaData with a metadata_type. The specific error occurs in the build_filter method of the Query class in django/db/models/sql/query.py. This method is responsible for constructing the filter clause of the query. The error suggests that certain fields or expressions are not allowed in the filter clause, which aligns with the issue described. The provided search results include the build_filter method, which contains the logic for adding filters to the query and checks whether the fields are filterable. This method is crucial for understanding and resolving the reported issue. It is clear from the method that it includes a check_filterable function call, which likely is the source of the NotSupportedError.
