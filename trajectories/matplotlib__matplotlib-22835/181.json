The error arises from an attempt to call `inverse` on a BoundaryNorm instance, which is not invertible and thus raises a ValueError. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code sections in `colors.py` where BoundaryNorm is defined and used, especially in the context of `format_cursor_data` and potentially in image handling classes like `AxesImage` or `ScalarMappable`. A possible solution could involve adding a check or a try-except block to handle non-invertible norms gracefully.",
