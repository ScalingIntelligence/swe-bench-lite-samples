The error occurs specifically in the `inverse` method of `BoundaryNorm` which raises a `ValueError`. Given the provided context, it is clear that the problem arises due to the non-invertible nature of `BoundaryNorm`. To address this, the search should focus on the `BoundaryNorm` class and its associated methods in the `colors.py` file, as well as the `format_cursor_data` method in the `artist.py` file. Additionally, since the issue is tied to the handling of the norm in `ScalarMappable`, the `ScalarMappable` class in `cm.py` should also be inspected. Potential solutions might involve adding a try-except block, or making `BoundaryNorm` approximately invertible, as suggested in the issue description.",
