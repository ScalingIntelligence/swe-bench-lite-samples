When processing cursor data, it attempts to use the norm's inverse method, which is where the crash occurs for the BoundaryNorm due to its non-invertibility. To fix this issue, we can consider modifying the format_cursor_data method to include a try-except block around the call to self.norm.inverse, catching the ValueError specifically. Alternatively, if it makes sense for BoundaryNorm to be invertible under certain conditions or approximately, we could also modify the BoundaryNorm class to support a controlled inversion or approximate inversion mechanism.",
