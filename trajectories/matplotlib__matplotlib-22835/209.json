Specifically, the crash occurs at the 'format_cursor_data' method in 'artist.py' when attempting to call 'self.norm.inverse' on a 'BoundaryNorm' object, which raises a 'ValueError' because 'BoundaryNorm' is not invertible. From the search results, 'BoundaryNorm' is defined in 'colors.py', and its '__init__' method is present. Additionally, the 'format_cursor_data' method in 'artist.py' includes the problematic code that tries to use 'self.norm.inverse'. Both of these sections of code are relevant to addressing the bug as they directly involve the 'BoundaryNorm' class and the method that crashes. Therefore, the task can be considered complete as the relevant code spans have been identified.",
