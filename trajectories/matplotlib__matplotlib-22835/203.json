The error occurs in the `format_cursor_data` method of the `_ImageBase` class, which is part of the `image.py` module. The immediate cause of the crash is the `inverse` method in the `BoundaryNorm` class, throwing a `ValueError` stating that 'BoundaryNorm is not invertible'. To address this, we need to locate the exact implementation of `BoundaryNorm`, `format_cursor_data`, and other related methods to determine potential fixes such as adding special checks, implementing a try-except block, or making BoundaryNorm approximately invertible.",

The traceback indicates that the error occurs because BoundaryNorm is not invertible. The relevant code spans should focus on the interaction between BoundaryNorm, AxesImage, and ScalarMappable classes, particularly methods that handle cursor data and normalization. From the search results, key spans to analyze include: BoundaryNorm in colors.py, AxesImage and its get_cursor_data method in image.py, and ScalarMappable in cm.py. Additionally, the imshow method in axes/_axes.py is relevant as it sets up the image and its properties, including the norm which could be BoundaryNorm.\n\nAnalyzing the code, the BoundaryNorm class in colors.py raises the 'not invertible' error in its inverse method, which suggests improvements or checks might be needed in that area to prevent crashes. The AxesImage class in image.py has a get_cursor_data method that is logically where the interaction error might occur if it tries to use an inverse normalization that isn't available. The ScalarMappable in cm.py also involves processing data with color mapping transformations, which need to be handled carefully to avoid issues, especially when BoundaryNorm is involved.\n\nThese code spans provide a good starting point to understand and potentially fix the issue, but further contextual analysis and possibly more detailed error handling or alternative calculations for BoundaryNorm's functions could be necessary to fully resolve the reported bug.",

The `format_cursor_data` method, which is part of the `AxesImage` class in the `image.py` module, seems to be where the interaction error starts. This method is responsible for formatting data under the cursor during interactions, and it likely accesses the `inverse` method of `BoundaryNorm` directly or indirectly. The `BoundaryNorm` class, part of `colors.py`, includes an `inverse` method that specifically raises the 'BoundaryNorm is not invertible' error. This indicates that while `BoundaryNorm` is intended to normalize color boundaries, it does not support inverse operations, which is necessary for functions like `format_cursor_data` that might need to reverse-map data values to colors. Potential fixes could involve modifying how `format_cursor_data` handles norm instances, by catching instances where the norm is not invertible or by implementing an approximation for the inverse in the `BoundaryNorm` class itself. Additionally, given the involvement of the `imshow` method in `Axes` class from `_axes.py`, which initializes an `AxesImage` with potentially `BoundaryNorm`, ensuring that this initialization checks compatibility or alters how `BoundaryNorm` is utilized could also be a point of intervention.",

The `format_cursor_data` method, which is part of the `AxesImage` class in the `image.py` module, seems to be where the interaction error starts. This method is responsible for formatting data under the cursor during interactions, and it likely accesses the `inverse` method of `BoundaryNorm` directly or indirectly. The `BoundaryNorm` class, part of `colors.py`, includes an `inverse` method that specifically raises the 'BoundaryNorm is not invertible' error. This indicates that while `BoundaryNorm` is intended to normalize color boundaries, it does not support inverse operations, which is necessary for functions like `format_cursor_data` that might need to reverse-map data values to colors. Potential fixes could involve modifying how `format_cursor_data` handles norm instances, by catching instances where the norm is not invertible or by implementing an approximation for the inverse in the `BoundaryNorm` class itself. Additionally, given the involvement of the `imshow` method in `Axes` class from `_axes.py`, which initializes an `AxesImage` with potentially `BoundaryNorm`, ensuring that this initialization checks compatibility or alters how `BoundaryNorm` is utilized could also be a point of intervention."
