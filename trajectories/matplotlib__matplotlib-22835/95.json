The crash occurs in the `format_cursor_data` method of the ScalarMappable class, specifically when calling the `inverse` method of BoundaryNorm, which raises a ValueError because BoundaryNorm is not invertible. To resolve this, we need to find the relevant code sections in the Matplotlib library that handle ScalarMappable, BoundaryNorm, and possibly the imshow function. I will search for the specific class names `ScalarMappable`, `BoundaryNorm`, and the function name `imshow` to locate the necessary code.",

From the search results, the following code spans appear relevant:\n\n1. `ScalarMappable` class and its `__init__` method in `lib/matplotlib/cm.py` - This class is likely involved in processing the color mapping and normalization.\n\n2. `BoundaryNorm` class and its `__init__` method in `lib/matplotlib/colors.py` - This class is the source of the error indicating that `BoundaryNorm` is not invertible.\n\n3. `Axes.imshow` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` - This method is used to display the image and involves setting up the normalization and color mapping.\n\n4. `imshow` function in `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` - This is the high-level interface for displaying images, which calls the `Axes.imshow` method.\n\nThese spans cover the initialization and use of `BoundaryNorm` and `ScalarMappable`, as well as the method used to display the image.

Therefore, the focus should be on adding a check within the `ScalarMappable` class to handle `BoundaryNorm` instances. The best place to add this check is likely within a method that deals with normalization, such as `_scale_norm` or `set_norm`. Given the context, `_scale_norm` appears to be the most relevant method for this check.",
