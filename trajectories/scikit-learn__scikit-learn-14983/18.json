Upon reviewing the search results, it becomes apparent that both classes inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`, which in turn might not have an explicit `__repr__` method defined. The common practice observed in the code is the use of `_build_repr` function in the `__repr__` method of base classes like `BaseCrossValidator` and `BaseShuffleSplit`. However, `_RepeatedSplits` does not explicitly define a `__repr__` method, leading to the incorrect representation in `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. To resolve this issue, explicit `__repr__` methods should be defined in `_RepeatedSplits`, or in the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes themselves, calling `_build_repr` to ensure the correct representation string is generated. Thus, the relevant code spans to be extracted are those related to `_RepeatedSplits`, `RepeatedKFold`, and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes, as well as the `_build_repr` function to ensure that the `__repr__` method is implemented correctly for these classes.",

This is used by both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` since they inherit from `BaseCrossValidator`.\n2. The `_RepeatedSplits` class, parent of both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, also has an `__init__` method where the `n_repeats`, `random_state`, and `n_splits` are set.\n3. The `_build_repr` function constructs the string representation for these classes, using the `__init__` signature to get the necessary parameters. The parameters used in `__init__` can be seen in the spans for `RepeatedKFold.__init__` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold.__init__`.\n4. The issue might be related to how `_build_repr` fetches the values of the parameters.\n\nGiven these observations, the identified code spans seem relevant to addressing the issue, as they cover the initialization and string representation logic of the affected classes.",
