The expected __repr__ strings should include details like `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`, but the actual output shows the default object representation. To address this, we need to locate the classes `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` within the `sklearn/model_selection` directory and see if they have proper __repr__ methods implemented. Additionally, the `_build_repr` method that might be used for constructing the __repr__ string could also be relevant. Given the context provided, we should focus our search on the `sklearn/model_selection` directory, specifically looking for these classes and any related methods.",
