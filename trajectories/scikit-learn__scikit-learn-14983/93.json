However, these classes do not directly implement a __repr__ method but inherit one from a higher level class or superclass. The __repr__ method in the base classes should, in theory, incorporate the relevant attributes such as n_splits, n_repeats, and random_state into the string representation. Given that the initialization parameters are captured and included in the representation by the generic _build_repr function in the BaseCrossValidator class, it appears that the provided file context should be sufficient to address the issue. It is reasonable to assume that if the __repr__ method for these classes isn't functioning as expected, it could be due to either an incorrect implementation of _build_repr or some specific edge cases not being handled correctly within these specific classes.",
