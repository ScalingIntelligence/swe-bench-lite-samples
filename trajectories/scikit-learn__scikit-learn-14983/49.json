The expected results include showing the parameters `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. The current implementation in the search results shows how `BaseCrossValidator` and `BaseEstimator` classes define their `__repr__` methods. Specifically, `BaseCrossValidator` uses a helper function `_build_repr` which attempts to build a representation based on the class's init parameters. The `BaseEstimator` class directly implements its `__repr__` method using a pretty printer to format the output. To address the issue for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, it's necessary to ensure that their `__repr__` methods correctly include all relevant parameters such as `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.
