The expected result is to show the parameters `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state` when using `repr()`. The actual result shows a default object representation string. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the `__repr__` method for these classes. The search results show the definitions and `__init__` methods for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. However, there are no explicit `__repr__` methods listed in the spans provided. This suggests that the `__repr__` implementation might be inherited or handled by a superclass or a default mechanism. Given the context, identifying the `__init__` methods is still relevant as it pertains to the class instantiation and parameters required for a proper `__repr__` string. Further investigation or the inclusion of more spans related to `__repr__` might be necessary to fully address the issue.",

The search results include several relevant code spans, such as `BaseCrossValidator.__repr__`, `BaseShuffleSplit.__repr__`, and `_build_repr`. These spans are relevant because they involve the representation logic for classes in the scikit-learn model selection module. Additionally, the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes themselves are found in the search results, along with their constructors. By examining these components, we can determine if the __repr__ methods for these classes are correctly implemented or if there is a need for adjustments.
