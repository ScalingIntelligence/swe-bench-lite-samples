The provided context from the `_split.py` file shows definitions for RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold classes. Since the problem specifically concerns the `__repr__` method, I will search for the `__repr__` methods within these classes and their superclasses. Additionally, the context indicates that the BaseShuffleSplit class has a `__repr__` method, which might be relevant as these classes could inherit it. I will look specifically for the `__repr__` method in files related to `_split` module and related base classes.",

The `BaseShuffleSplit.__init__` method, which defines `n_splits`, `test_size`, `train_size`, and `random_state`, is also relevant as it shows how these parameters would be included in the `__repr__` output, aligning with the expected results.
