From the search results, we can see that both `BaseCrossValidator` and `BaseShuffleSplit` have a `__repr__` method that uses the `_build_repr` function. It is worth examining these methods to understand if they correctly handle the attributes of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. The provided code spans show the implementation of these methods, which could be the source of the issue or could be modified to resolve it.
