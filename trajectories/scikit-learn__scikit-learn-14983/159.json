The initial analysis suggests that the issue is likely due to the absence of a custom `__repr__` method in these classes, as they currently rely on the default behavior provided by the `object` class. From the search results, it's apparent that similar classes like `BaseCrossValidator` have a `__repr__` method using the `_build_repr` function. This function calls `sorted([p.name for p in init_signature.parameters.values() if p.name != 'self' and p.kind != p.VAR_KEYWORD])` to extract arguments from the initializer clearly. Additionally, `BaseEstimator` offers another model for implementing a `__repr__`, which uses the `_EstimatorPrettyPrinter` utility for pretty-printing and managing overflows in the string representation. By integrating similar functionality into `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, we can resolve the issue.",
