The expected output includes parameters like `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. However, the actual output is a generic object representation. To address this, we need to identify the `__repr__` method in the relevant classes or their base classes. In the provided search results, we can see that both classes inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`, which does not define its own `__repr__` method. Instead, it relies on `_build_repr`, which is defined in the file. This function constructs the representation string based on the class's init parameters. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those that define `_build_repr` and the `__repr__` methods in any of the base classes of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. We should also consider any additional methods in `_RepeatedSplits` that might affect the representation, although none are apparent from the provided code. Overall, the identified spans include `BaseCrossValidator.__repr__`, `BaseShuffleSplit.__repr__`, and `_build_repr`.",
