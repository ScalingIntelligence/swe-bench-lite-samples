The expected behavior is for these classes to display their parameters (e.g., n_splits, n_repeats, random_state) in their __repr__ output, but they currently display a less informative string. To address this, relevant code spans were identified in the `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` file, specifically the `__repr__` methods for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, which currently rely on `_build_repr`. Also, the `_build_repr` function itself was identified as essential for constructing the repr string. Additionally, the `__repr__` method of `BaseShuffleSplit` was noted as it might serve as a reference for how to implement the repr for the other classes. From the `sklearn/base.py` file, the `BaseEstimator.__repr__` method was also relevant as both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` likely inherit some behavior from `BaseEstimator`. These code spans should be sufficient to understand and potentially fix the incorrect repr output for the mentioned classes.",
