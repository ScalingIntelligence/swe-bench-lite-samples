This issue can be addressed by ensuring that these classes override the __repr__ method to display the expected output, similar to what `BaseShuffleSplit` class does with its __repr__ method. The current context shows the relevant code spans for the initialization of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes. The search results provide insights into the __repr__ method of `BaseCrossValidator` and `BaseShuffleSplit`, which are likely to be the parent or related classes. It is crucial to ensure that the __repr__ method in `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes follows a similar pattern to `BaseShuffleSplit.__repr__`, utilizing the `_build_repr` function to generate the string representation. This ensures that the __repr__ output includes the parameters specific to these classes, such as `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. The analysis of the search results indicates that the `_RepeatedSplits` class, the parent class for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, does not currently override the __repr__ method, leading to the incorrect representation.
