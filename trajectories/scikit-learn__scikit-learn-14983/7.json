The expected output should include the parameters `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`, but the actual output is a generic object representation string.\n\nFrom the search results, it is evident that both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`. While the constructors for these classes initialize the necessary parameters (`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`), the `__repr__` method is inherited from the `BaseEstimator` class defined in `sklearn/base.py`. The `BaseEstimator.__repr__` method is responsible for generating the string representation of the object. However, the current implementation does not include specific details about `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, leading to the generic output.\n\nTo resolve this issue, it is necessary to modify the `__repr__` method in such a way that it includes the specific parameters of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. This can be achieved either by overriding the `__repr__` method in the `_RepeatedSplits` class or by enhancing the `BaseEstimator`'s `__repr__` to include more specific information in subclasses like `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.\n\nThe relevant code spans identified are:\n\n1. `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` class definitions and their respective `__init__` methods.\n2.
