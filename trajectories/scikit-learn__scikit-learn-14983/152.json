The expected output includes the parameters `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`, but the actual output shows a generic object representation. To address this, we need to examine the `__repr__` method implementation for these classes. From the search results, we can see that `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`, which does not override the `__repr__` method from its superclass `BaseCrossValidator`. This method uses `_build_repr` function, which constructs the representation string based on the class initialization parameters. The issue might be that the `_build_repr` function does not correctly handle the additional parameters (`n_repeats`) specific to these classes. The relevant code spans to investigate further are the `__repr__` methods in `BaseCrossValidator` and `BaseShuffleSplit`, the `_build_repr` function, and the `__init__` methods of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.",

The current implementation of the __repr__ method in the BaseCrossValidator class and the _build_repr function seems to be designed to handle this, but it appears that RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold are not overriding this method correctly or inheriting the behavior as expected. The provided search results include the relevant sections of code where changes need to be made. Specifically, the __init__ methods for RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold need to ensure that the arguments are correctly passed and that the __repr__ method, which calls _build_repr, accurately reflects these parameters. By examining the code, it appears that the issue might lie in how the parameters are being handled in the _RepeatedSplits class or in the specific __init__ methods of RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold.
