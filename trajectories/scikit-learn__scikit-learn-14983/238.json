The current `__repr__` implementation in `BaseCrossValidator` does not include `n_repeats` because it is not defined in the `__init__` method of `BaseCrossValidator` or its immediate subclasses. `n_repeats` is a parameter of the `_RepeatedSplits` class, which `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` inherit from. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `_build_repr` function properly captures and displays `n_repeats` for these classes.",
