This indicates that the `__repr__` method for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` should also follow this implementation pattern since they inherit from `BaseCrossValidator`. The `_build_repr` function constructs the string representation for the class by gathering the names and values of the parameters passed to the class's `__init__` method, excluding 'self' and variable keyword arguments. Since the `__repr__` method is defined in the base class, we can confirm that the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes will also implement this method and should display the attributes `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state` if they are set. The unexpected behavior described in the issue might be due to a bug in the `_build_repr` function or missing attributes in the initialization of the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` instances.",
