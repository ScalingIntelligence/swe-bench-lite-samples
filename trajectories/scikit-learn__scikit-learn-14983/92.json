The current context shows the definitions and initializations of these classes in `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py`, but does not include the `__repr__` method implementations for these classes. The search results lead to `sklearn/utils/_pprint.py`, which contains utility code for pretty-printing objects. The code spans in this module, particularly the `KeyValTuple` class with its `__repr__` method, suggest that this module might be responsible for handling the string representation of objects. Further investigation is needed to determine if this module is directly involved in the `__repr__` method for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, or if these classes have their own `__repr__` method within `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` that needs to be corrected or implemented. Given the context, it is reasonable to conclude that the relevance of the search results is not directly evident, as the reported issue indicates that the `__repr__` methods are not functioning correctly, but the search results do not directly address this.

The initial search focused on the `_RepeatedSplits` base class, but if it does not contain the `__repr__` method, it's sensible to explore higher-level base classes like `BaseCrossValidator` or `BaseEstimator`. An alternative approach would be to identify where the string representation logic is being overridden or where there might be an issue in the inheritance chain that affects how `__repr__` is being handled for these classes.
