These classes are derived from `_RepeatedSplits`, which in turn is related to `BaseCrossValidator`. The `__repr__` method for these classes should display their parameters correctly, but currently, they show generic object representations. Examining the `_build_repr` function and possibly the `__repr__` methods in the `BaseCrossValidator`, `_RepeatedSplits`, `RepeatedKFold`, and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes is necessary to understand and fix this issue.",

The expected output should include parameters like n_splits, n_repeats, and random_state. The current implementation of __repr__ for these classes inherits from BaseCrossValidator which uses the _build_repr function to generate the representation string. This function inspects the class's __init__ method to determine which parameters to include in the representation. In the provided context and search results, the RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold classes are correctly inheriting the __repr__ method from BaseCrossValidator, but the issue lies in how _build_repr function constructs the string. The search results do include the relevant sections of code for these classes, particularly their __init__ methods and the inherited __repr__ method, which points to the _build_repr function. This function should capture the necessary parameters (n_splits, n_repeats, random_state) from the class's __init__ method. The analysis suggests that the issue might be resolved by ensuring that _build_repr correctly captures all necessary parameters from the __init__ methods of RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold. This process involves verifying that the _build_repr function correctly parses the __init__ signature and includes all relevant parameters in the output string.",
