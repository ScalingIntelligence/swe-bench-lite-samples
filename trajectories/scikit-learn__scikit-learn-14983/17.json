The current `__repr__` method does not display the correct string representation and instead shows a default object representation. To fix this, we need to locate the `__repr__` methods for these classes and ensure they correctly reflect the parameters: `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. Given the provided context, the `__repr__` methods might be defined in the `_split.py` file or might rely on a more generic method defined in another file, such as `base.py`.",

The `_build_repr` function, which is used by the `__repr__` method in `BaseCrossValidator` and `BaseShuffleSplit`, is also included. Since the issue is about the representation of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, the relevant spans are those defining these classes and their `__repr__` methods (if they exist). However, based on the search results, neither `RepeatedKFold` nor `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` have their own `__repr__` methods; they inherit from `BaseCrossValidator`, which uses `_build_repr`.
