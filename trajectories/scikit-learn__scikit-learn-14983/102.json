The expected representation string should include parameters like `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. However, the actual representation shows a generic object representation string. I should focus my search on the `sklearn.model_selection._split` module where these classes are defined. I will check for the presence of the `__repr__` method in these classes and if they correctly include the necessary parameters in their string representation.",
