Upon examining the search results, it's evident that both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`, which does not define its own __repr__ method. As a result, they likely fall back to the default object representation provided by Python. The key to solving this issue lies in defining a __repr__ method for `_RepeatedSplits` that captures and displays the specific parameters of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, such as `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. The function `_build_repr` can be utilized to create this representation since it seems to be used by other classes like `BaseShuffleSplit` to generate their __repr__ strings. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those pertaining to `_RepeatedSplits`, `RepeatedKFold`, and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, along with the `_build_repr` function.",
