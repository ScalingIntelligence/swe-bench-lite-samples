The provided file context confirms that other classes like `LeaveOneOut`, `LeavePOut`, `_BaseKFold`, and others correctly define their `__init__` methods with parameters that need to be included in the string representation. Since the `_build_repr` function handles the task of constructing the `__repr__` output based on the initialization parameters and their current values, it should now correctly reflect `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state` for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` once their `__init__` methods are properly defined.",
