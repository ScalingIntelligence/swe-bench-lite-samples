From the given context and search results, it is evident that both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`, which does not have its own __repr__ method. Consequently, they use the default method from the `object` class, leading to the undesired output format. To resolve this issue, we need to implement a __repr__ method in the `_RepeatedSplits` class or ensure that `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` correctly utilize the `_build_repr` function in their __repr__ method. Reviewing the search results, it is clear that `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` initialize correctly with parameters, but their __repr__ is not customized.
