Given the context provided, the `kind` attribute for the `Derivative` of a MatrixSymbol type is returning 'UndefinedKind' instead of the expected type. This suggests a potential bug in the `Derivative` class or its interaction with `MatrixSymbol`. It's likely that the issue can be found in the files where `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` classes are defined, as well as their interactions. Additionally, the `MatrixKind` and kind-related functionality might also be relevant.",

The issue highlights that while `Integral` correctly returns a `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` for a `MatrixSymbol`, `Derivative` returns `UndefinedKind`. This suggests a discrepancy in the handling of the `kind` attribute within the `Derivative` class when dealing with matrix expressions. The relevant code spans should include sections from the `Derivative` class, particularly where the `kind` attribute is set or inferred, and any interactions or conditions concerning `MatrixSymbol` or matrix expressions. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class should be inspected for any specific handling of derivatives or kinds that might relate to the issue. Furthermore, the `MatrixKind` class should also be reviewed as it defines the kind for matrix elements and might be involved in the kind determination process for both `Integral` and `Derivative` operations on matrices.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the 'kind' attribute of the Derivative class when applied to a MatrixSymbol. The correct behavior is shown for an Integral, where the 'kind' attribute correctly returns 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)'. However, when a Derivative is applied to the same MatrixSymbol, it returns 'UndefinedKind', which is incorrect. The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results and determine if the search task is complete.\n\nFirst, we examine the existing context in 'sympy/core/function.py', focusing on the 'Derivative' class and its methods. The '__new__' method handles the initialization and differentiation logic. It imports and handles various types, including 'MatrixCommon' and 'MatrixExpr'. The 'variable_count' property extracts the variables and their counts from the instance.\n\nNext, we look at 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py', where the 'MatrixSymbol' class is defined. This class has a '_diff_wrt' attribute set to True, indicating it can be differentiated. The '_eval_derivative' method returns a 'ZeroMatrix' of the appropriate size, which suggests that differentiating a 'MatrixSymbol' should not result in 'UndefinedKind' but rather in this 'ZeroMatrix'.\n\nMoving on to the new search results, we see additional methods of the 'Derivative' class, such as 'canonical', 'canonical', '_sort_variable_count', '_eval_is_commutative', '_wrt_variables', 'variables', and 'free_symbols'. These methods manage various aspects of the differentiation process.\n\nFor 'MatrixSymbol', there are methods related to the symbol's properties and differentiation, such as '__new__', 'shape', 'name', '_entry', 'free_symbols', and '_eval_simplify'. The '_eval_derivative' method for 'MatrixSymbol' is consistent with the previous context, suggesting that the issue may lie elsewhere in the 'Derivative' class's handling of 'MatrixSymbol'.\n\nFrom this analysis, the most relevant spans are those in 'sympy/core/function.py' dealing with the 'Derivative' class, especially the '__new__' method and 'variable_count' property. Also relevant is the '_eval_derivative' method in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' for 'MatrixSymbol'. These spans provide the necessary context to understand and potentially fix the 'kind' attribute issue.",

Derivatives wrt defined functions (like\n    cos(x)) are not allowed, either:\n\n        >>> (x*y*z).diff(x*y)\n        Traceback (most recent call last):\n        ...\n        ValueError: Can't calculate derivative wrt x*y.\n\n    To make it easier to work with variational calculus, however,\n    derivatives wrt AppliedUndef and Derivatives are allowed.\n    For example, in the Euler-Lagrange method one may write\n    F(t, u, v) where u = f(t) and v = f'(t). These variables can be\n    written explicitly as functions of time::\n\n        >>> from sympy.abc import t\n        >>> F = Function('F')\n        >>> U = f(t)\n        >>> V = U.diff(t)\n\n    The derivative wrt f(t) can be obtained directly:\n\n        >>> direct = F(t, U, V).diff(U)\n\n    When differentiation wrt a non-Symbol is attempted, the non-Symbol\n    is temporarily converted to a Symbol while the differentiation\n    is performed and the same answer is obtained:\n\n        >>> indirect = F(t, U, V).subs(U, x).diff(x).subs(x, U)\n        >>> assert direct == indirect\n\n    The implication of this non-symbol replacement is that all\n    functions are treated as independent of other functions and the\n    symbols are independent of the functions that contain them::\n\n        >>> x.diff(f(x))\n        0\n        >>> g(x).diff(f(x))\n        0\n\n    It also means that derivatives are assumed to depend only\n    on the variables of differentiation, not on anything contained\n    within the expression being differentiated::\n\n        >>> F = f(x)\n        >>> Fx = F.diff(x)\n        >>> Fx.diff(F)  # derivative depends on x, not F\n        0\n        >>> Fxx = Fx.diff(x)\n        >>> Fxx.diff(Fx)  # derivative depends on x, not Fx\n        0\n\n    The last example can be made explicit by showing the replacement\n    of Fx in Fxx with y:\n\n        >>> Fxx.subs(Fx, y)\n        Derivative(y, x)\n\n        Since that in itself will evaluate to zero, differentiating\n        wrt Fx will also be zero:\n\n        >>> _.doit()\n        0\n\n    Replacing undefined functions with concrete expressions\n\n    One must be careful to replace undefined functions with expressions\n    that contain variables consistent with the function definition and\n    the variables of differentiation or else insconsistent result will\n    be obtained. Consider the following example:\n\n    >>> eq = f(x)*g(y)\n    >>> eq.subs(f(x), x*y).diff(x, y).doit()\n    y*Derivative(g(y), y) + g(y)\n    >>> eq.diff(x, y).subs(f(x), x*y).doit()\n    y*Derivative(g(y), y)\n\n    The results differ because `f(x)` was replaced with an expression\n    that involved both variables of differentiation. In the abstract\n    case, differentiation of `f(x)` by `y` is 0; in the concrete case,\n    the presence of `y` made that derivative nonvanishing and produced\n    the extra `g(y)` term.\n\n    Defining differentiation for an object\n\n    An object must define ._eval_derivative(symbol) method that returns\n    the differentiation result. This function only needs to consider the\n    non-trivial case where expr contains symbol and it should call the diff()\n    method internally (not _eval_derivative); Derivative should be the only\n    one to call _eval_derivative.\n\n    Any class can allow derivatives to be taken with respect to\n    itself (while indicating its scalar nature).
