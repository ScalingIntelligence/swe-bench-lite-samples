The incorrect behavior is that the `kind` attribute of the `Derivative` returns 'UndefinedKind' instead of an expected kind. To resolve this, we need to investigate how the `kind` attribute is determined in the context of a `Derivative` involving a `MatrixSymbol`. Relevant files and functions include those dealing with derivatives and matrix expressions, such as `sympy/core/function.py`, `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, and `sympy/tensor/array/array_derivatives.py`. Focusing on the `Derivative` class and related methods in these files should provide insights into how the `kind` attribute is set or computed.",

The user observes that `Integral(A, x).kind` correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` while `Derivative(A, x).kind` returns `UndefinedKind`. This indicates a potential bug in how the `Derivative` class handles the `kind` attribute for matrix symbols. In the provided search results, there are several relevant code spans which I will analyze to determine their relevance to the reported issue:\n\n1. From `sympy/core/function.py`, I identified several spans including a definition of `Derivative` and related method definitions within this class (`canonical`, `_sort_variable_count`, `_eval_is_commutative`, `expr`, `_wrt_variables`, `variables`, `variable_count`, `derivative_count`, `free_symbols`). These largely pertain to the core logic and properties of the `Derivative` class.\n\n2. Within `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, there are definitions for the `MatrixSymbol` class along with properties such as `_eval_derivative`, which could be related based on the nature of the reported issue.\n\n3. From `sympy/tensor/array/array_derivatives.py`, I found there are subclasses and related methods associated with array-type derivatives, which might also be in consideration.\n\nBased on the content of the search results and the nature of the reported issue, I am selecting specific code spans which might directly be contributing to the `kind` attribute issue when handling `MatrixSymbol` within the `Derivative` class. It appears necessary to inspect these spans to trace accurately the attribute handling and if there is a specific logic failure in the context of `MatrixSymbol` objects.",
