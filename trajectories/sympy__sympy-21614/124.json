The issue points out that while `Integral(A, x).kind` returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, `Derivative(A, x).kind` returns `UndefinedKind`, which is incorrect. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the `Derivative` class and potentially in the `MatrixSymbol` class that handle the `kind` attribute or its determination. The search results include multiple spans in the `Derivative` class (e.g., `__new__`, `canonical`, `_eval_derivative`, etc.) and one span in the `MatrixSymbol` class (`_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`). These spans are relevant because they deal with the creation and evaluation of derivatives and their properties, which may include the `kind` attribute. Specifically, the `__new__` method is crucial as it handles the initialization of the `Derivative` object and includes logic for determining the differentiation variables and their counts. The `canonical` property is also relevant as it standardizes the derivative representation, potentially influencing the `kind` attribute. The `_eval_derivative` method is relevant because it evaluates the derivative with respect to a given variable, which may involve the `kind` attribute. The `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` method in the `MatrixSymbol` class is relevant because it evaluates the derivative lines of a matrix symbol, which could be related to the `kind` attribute when dealing with matrix derivatives.",

The issue provides examples where Integral of a MatrixSymbol has the correct 'kind' attribute, but the Derivative does not. The current context shows the relevant code spans in the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py` and the `MatrixSymbol` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. The new search results confirm the presence of these classes and their methods, specifically focusing on how the `kind` attribute might be set or affected during differentiation. The `Derivative.__new__` method in `sympy/core/function.py` is crucial as it handles the creation of derivatives and includes logic for dealing with different types of expressions, including MatrixExpr. The `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` method in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` is also relevant as it defines how a MatrixSymbol should be differentiated. Looking at these methods will provide insights into how the 'kind' attribute is or should be handled during differentiation.
