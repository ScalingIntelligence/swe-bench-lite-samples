The issue notes that while the `kind` attribute correctly returns MatrixKind(NumberKind) for an Integral involving MatrixSymbol, it incorrectly returns UndefinedKind for a Derivative involving MatrixSymbol. The task is to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the `kind` attribute in these classes.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, we first see the Derivative class and its related methods in 'sympy/core/function.py', but there's no direct mention of the `kind` attribute here. Moving on to 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py', we find that the `kind` attribute is directly assigned as MatrixKind() for the MatrixExpr class and its subclass MatrixSymbol. This seems relevant given the issue mentions MatrixKind and the problem exists when dealing with MatrixSymbol in a Derivative. Hence, the span in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' labelled 'MatrixExpr' is relevant as it deals with the initialization of the `kind` attribute.\n\nNext, we should check if there are any other code spans where the `kind` attribute is manipulated or accessed and compare these with the reported issue.

Given that the `kind` attribute should return a specific kind when applied to a `MatrixSymbol`, it's essential to look deeper into the relationship and definitions in the MatrixExpr hierarchy, specifically how `MatrixSymbol` and `Derivative` interact or are meant to represent kinds in these contexts. Since direct files related to derivatives didn\u2019t yield results, consider checking core functionality files or higher-level structural files as they might contain more abstract definitions or interaction mechanics missing in lower-level function files.",

This discrepancy suggests that the `Derivative` class is not properly handling matrix expressions when calculating derivatives. Given the context and the search results, the focus should be on the `Derivative` class within the `sympy/core/function.py` file. This file contains the `Derivative` class, which includes the `__new__` method where the logic for handling derivatives is defined. Additionally, the `MatrixExpr` class and `MatrixSymbol` class from the context show how matrices are handled in the codebase. Analyzing the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py`, particularly the `__new__` method and the checks for `isinstance(v, MatrixExpr)`, can help identify where the derivative calculation for matrix expressions might be failing. The `MatrixKind` class, as referenced in `MatrixExpr`, suggests that matrices should have a specific kind, but this is not reflected in the `Derivative` output. Therefore, the relevant spans in the search results are those that deal with the creation and evaluation of derivatives, especially those related to matrix expressions, which could pinpoint the missing implementation or incorrect handling of matrix derivatives.",

The `Derivative` class is responsible for handling differentiation operations, and it indirectly interacts with `MatrixSymbol` through the variable of differentiation. The `kind` attribute, which is critical for type identification and handling in SymPy, appears to be predefined for `MatrixExpr` as `MatrixKind()`. However, this kind does not seem to carry over or be explicitly addressed in the differentiation process within the `Derivative` class. Specifically, in the `__new__` method of `Derivative`, there is no explicit mention or handling of the `kind` attribute during the differentiation process for `MatrixSymbol`. This missing link might be the reason why `Derivative(A, x).kind` returns `UndefinedKind`. It is recommended to investigate how the `kind` attribute of `MatrixSymbol` can be preserved or propagated correctly during differentiation within `Derivative`.",

The current behavior shows `UndefinedKind` for the derivative of a `MatrixSymbol`, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should match that of the `Integral` class, yielding `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. The relevant code spans to address this issue include the `Derivative` class definition and its methods, especially those related to differentiation and kind attribute handling. Specifically, the `Derivative.__new__`, `Derivative.variable_count`, and `Derivative._eval_derivative` methods are crucial for differentiating expressions, including matrix expressions. Additionally, the `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol` classes, particularly their kind attributes and differentiation methods, are relevant since the issue involves matrix derivatives. The provided search results confirm the presence of these methods, indicating they are likely places to implement or adjust the kind attribute behavior for derivatives of matrix expressions.",

The `Derivative` class method `__new__` and the related utility method `_derivative_dispatch` are shown, which handle the creation and differentiation processes. However, in the `__new__` method of `Derivative`, there is no explicit handling of the `kind` attribute for `MatrixSymbol`, which aligns with the observed issue where the `kind` attribute returns `UndefinedKind`.
