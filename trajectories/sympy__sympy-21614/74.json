This discrepancy needs to be investigated. The issue is likely to be within the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py` or related to how the kind attribute is handled in matrix expressions under `sympy/matrices/`. Additionally, relevant functions and methods include `_eval_derivative`, `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`, and the handling of kind attributes. The search should concentrate on these areas to uncover the root cause.",

The expected behavior is for the `kind` attribute to return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` for an `Integral` but returns `UndefinedKind` for a `Derivative`. The search results indicate that the `Derivative` class in 'sympy/core/function.py' has multiple methods and properties that might be relevant, including `__new__`, `canonical`, `_sort_variable_count`, `_eval_is_commutative`, `_eval_derivative`, `variables`, `variable_count`, `_eval_subs`, `_eval_lseries`, `_eval_nseries`, `_eval_as_leading_term`, and `_sage_`. These methods and properties handle various aspects of the `Derivative` object creation, evaluation, and interaction with other SymPy objects. Notably, the `_eval_derivative` method and the `variable_count` property are directly related to the differentiation process and might hold the key to understanding the issue with the `kind` attribute. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' is also provided, with methods such as `__new__`, `shape`, `name`, `free_symbols`, `_eval_derivative`, and `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`. These methods might be relevant to the issue as they handle the properties and derivatives of matrix expressions, particularly the `_eval_derivative` method which might interact with the `Derivative` class. However, the current search results do not directly identify the specific section of code that handles the `kind` attribute directly. Further inspection of the mentioned methods in the `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` classes would be necessary to pinpoint the exact location where the `kind` attribute is set or influenced.",

This issue suggests that the Derivative class may not be handling the MatrixSymbol correctly in its differentiation logic.\n\nWe have reviewed the existing file context in 'sympy/core/function.py' which includes the Derivative class and its methods such as '__new__', 'canonical', '_sort_variable_count', '_eval_is_commutative', '_eval_derivative', 'variables', 'variable_count', '_eval_subs', '_eval_lseries', '_eval_nseries', '_eval_as_leading_term', and '_sage_'. We also reviewed 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' which includes the MatrixSymbol class and its methods such as '__new__', 'shape', 'name', 'free_symbols', and '_eval_derivative'.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context, particularly in 'sympy/core/function.py' which includes the Derivative class and its methods again, confirming the previous findings. 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' includes the MatrixElement class and its '_eval_derivative' method, which might also be relevant.\n\nWe have identified the following relevant code spans:\n- Derivative class in 'sympy/core/function.py'\n- MatrixSymbol class in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py'\n- MatrixElement class and its '_eval_derivative' method in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py'\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it appears that the Derivative class is not correctly handling the differentiation of MatrixSymbol objects, leading to the 'UndefinedKind' attribute. Further investigation and possible updates to the _eval_derivative method in the Derivative class or related methods might be necessary to resolve this issue.",

Given this interpretation, one potential candidate is the `__new__` method, which is responsible for constructing the `Derivative` object and might include the logic to determine the kind of the derivative.
