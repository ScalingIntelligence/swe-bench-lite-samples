This issue suggests investigating the `Derivative` class and its methods.\n\nIn the search results, the `Derivative` class is defined with several methods and properties. Notably, the `__new__` method initializes the `Derivative` object and checks the variables of differentiation. The `_diff_wrt` property checks if the expression can be differentiated with respect to a variable. The `canonical` property and `_sort_variable_count` method are also related to organizing and processing the derivative variables.\n\nIn terms of relevance to the reported issue, the `Derivative.__new__` method initializes the object and handles the variables of differentiation, which directly relates to the creation of a `Derivative` object. The `Derivative._diff_wrt` property is also relevant as it checks the feasibility of differentiation for the expression. These methods are likely places where the `kind` attribute, which is incorrect in the reported issue, could be influenced or set.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sections of code that are likely relevant to the reported issue regarding the `kind` attribute of a `Derivative` object are the initialization method `__new__` and the differentiation check property `_diff_wrt`. This focuses on the setup and validation processes of a `Derivative` object, which are crucial for ensuring the correct `kind` attribute.",

The issue is that the `kind` attribute returns `UndefinedKind` for a `Derivative` object applied to a `MatrixSymbol`, whereas it correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` for an `Integral` object applied to the same `MatrixSymbol`. The search results provide the relevant code spans that appear to be involved in the construction and evaluation of `Derivative` objects. Notably, the `__new__` method of the `Derivative` class is responsible for initializing derivative objects, including handling cases where the expression to be differentiated is a matrix. The `canonical` method and the `_sort_variable_count` class method are also relevant for understanding the internal workings of derivatives in sympy, potentially involving the handling of kinds or types of expressions. These code spans appear to be directly related to the handling of derivatives, including matrix-like expressions, and thus relevant to the issue reported.",

The correct behavior is that `Integral(A, x).kind` should return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` while `Derivative(A, x).kind` incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind`. From the provided file context, the `Derivative` class definition and its key methods (`__new__`, `_diff_wrt`, `canonical`, `_sort_variable_count`) have been partially detailed. Two files, `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` and `sympy/core/function.py`, were further searched, revealing additional code spans which substantially expand our understanding of `MatrixExpr` and `Derivative` classes, respectively. The critical insight is that `MatrixExpr` instances have `MatrixKind` assigned however, specific implementations like `_eval_derivative` in `MatrixExpr` do not discuss the `kind` attribute altering for derivates other than the intention to handle them as ZeroMatrix if they don't involve `x`. Thus, although an alteration at def ___eval_derivative__ in `MatrixExpr` may address directly or indirectly, the report hints not at handling a new feature(derivate corresponding to its kind determination) but rectifying an coexistent feature's workability(defn of derivative(A, x).
