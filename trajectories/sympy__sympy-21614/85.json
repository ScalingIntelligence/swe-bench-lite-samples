This indicates a problem with how the `Derivative` class handles the `kind` attribute when differentiating matrices. The search results reveal relevant code spans in both `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` and `sympy/core/function.py`. The focus in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` is on the `MatrixSymbol` class, particularly on its methods like `_eval_derivative` and `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`, which are directly involved in differentiation. In `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Derivative` class is of primary interest, especially methods related to the differentiation process such as `__new__`, `_eval_is_commutative`, `expr`, `_wrt_variables`, `variables`, `variable_count`, `free_symbols`, and `_eval_subs`. These methods collectively handle the creation of derivatives, manage the variables involved, and evaluate substitutions, all of which are crucial for understanding and rectifying the issue with the `kind` attribute.\n\nThe identified spans provide a comprehensive view of the code involved in the differentiation process of matrices, which is essential for addressing the reported issue. Specifically, the `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` and `Derivative.__new__` are of particular importance as they deal directly with the differentiation of matrix expressions and the instantiation of derivative objects, respectively. The inclusion of these spans should provide a solid foundation for addressing the issue related to the `kind` attribute in derivatives of matrix expressions.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the `kind` attribute of `Derivative` not being correctly set for a matrix symbol. This issue is related to the handling of matrix derivatives in the `Sympy` library. Initially, the file context provided snippets from `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, specifically focusing on the `MatrixSymbol` class and its derivative evaluation methods. The search results provided additional contexts, primarily from the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py` and the `MatrixSymbol` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`.\n\nFrom the `MatrixSymbol` class, it is evident that the derivative evaluation methods are being examined. The span 'MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative' sets the derivative of the matrix symbol to a zero matrix, which might not correctly reflect the kind attribute reported in the issue. Additionally, 'MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines' handles some differential matrix line evaluations, suggesting deeper handling of matrix differentiation.\n\nOn the other hand, the `Derivative` class spans provide a deeper understanding of how derivatives are generally handled and instantiated in `Sympy`. Observations include the canonical form of derivatives (span 'Derivative.canonical'), how variables are iterated and evaluated for derivatives ('Derivative.__new__'), and property definitions related to expressions and variables ('Derivative.expr', 'Derivative.variables', 'Derivative.variable_count'). These spans collectively reveal the mechanics behind derivative computations, which need adjustment to accurately represent the kind attribute according to the reported issue.\n\nGiven these analyses, derived data is likely spread across both `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` contexts, emphasizing that while `Derivative` handles the global derivative mechanism, `MatrixSymbol` particularly deals with matrix-specific differentiation, which is suspected to have the primary root of the kind attribute issue.\n\nThe suggested relevance in code spans lies in scrutinizing `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` and `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines` for any deficiencies in handling kind attributes during matrix differentiation, and the `Derivative` class for understanding broader functionality affecting any special cases like matrix symbols. This suggests going beyond the spans to cross-examine these classes comprehensively to adjust the implementation or algorithm to resolve the issue.",

Specifically, the issue is that the `kind` attribute of `Derivative(A, x)` returns `UndefinedKind` instead of a `MatrixKind` as in the case of `Integral(A, x)`. Given this context, my task is to identify relevant code spans from the provided search results that are related to the `kind` attribute or the handling of `Derivative` with `MatrixSymbol`. The relevant files are likely in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` and `sympy/core/function.py`. In `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, the classes `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol` are relevant, especially since `MatrixSymbol` has methods like `_eval_derivative`. In `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Derivative` class and its methods are crucial for understanding how derivatives are handled, including the `__new__` method which is responsible for initializing the `Derivative` object. Furthermore, the `kind` attribute is mentioned in the `MatrixKind` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py`, which is relevant for understanding the kind handling. From the search results, I will identify the spans that are most relevant to the issue.",
