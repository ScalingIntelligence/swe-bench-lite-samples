The issue specifically points out that while `Integral(A, x).kind` returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, `Derivative(A, x).kind` returns `UndefinedKind`, which is incorrect. To address this, I need to find the code relevant to the `kind` attribute in the `Derivative` class or related functionality. I searched through the provided code spans and identified several key spans in the `sympy/core/function.py` file that are likely relevant. These include the `Derivative.__new__` method, where the `kind` attribute could potentially be set, and the `Derivative._sort_variable_count` method, which, although not directly related to the `kind` attribute, is involved in sorting variables during differentiation and hence could contain relevant logic related to derivative properties. Additionally, since the issue mentions `MatrixSymbol`, I also reviewed spans in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` related to `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol`. These files and spans are crucial because they deal with the core functionality of derivatives and matrix expressions in SymPy, which are central to the issue at hand.",

The current behavior returns `UndefinedKind` instead of the expected `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. To address this, we need to examine the `Derivative` class and its methods, particularly where the `kind` attribute might be set or inferred. From the provided contexts, the `Derivative.__new__` and `Derivative.canonical` methods are critical as they construct and potentially handle the `kind` attribute. Additionally, the `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol` classes in `matexpr.py` are relevant as they define matrix expression behaviors, including their `kind` attribute. The search results confirm the presence of these classes and methods, providing further details on how `Derivative` objects are created and managed, and how matrix expressions are differentiated. By focusing on these spans, particularly those handling the `kind` attribute and differentiation logic, we can identify the necessary code to address the issue.",

The Derivative class is defined in sympy/core/function.py, which includes several spans like Derivative.__new__, Derivative.canonical, Derivative._sort_variable_count, Derivative._eval_is_commutative, etc. These spans handle the creation, evaluation, and properties of the Derivative class. The MatrixSymbol class is defined in sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py, which includes spans like MatrixSymbol.__new__, MatrixSymbol.shape, MatrixSymbol.name, etc. These spans handle the creation and properties of the MatrixSymbol class.
