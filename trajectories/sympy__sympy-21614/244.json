The correct behavior is for the `Integral` class to return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, while the `Derivative` class incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy points to a potential bug in how the `Derivative` class handles matrix derivatives. Potential starting points for the investigation include the `Derivative` class definition itself and related classes that might handle matrix derivatives, such as `MatrixSymbol` and `MatrixExpr`.",

The analysis involves checking how the 'kind' attribute is handled for both `Integral` and `Derivative` classes, especially in relation to `MatrixSymbol`. The search results provide essential details about the `Derivative` class, including its constructor and properties related to differentiation. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class defines properties and methods relevant to matrix expressions. The `MatrixKind` class, defining the kind for matrix elements, is also present. These components are crucial for identifying the logic related to the 'kind' attribute and how it is applied or calculated for derivatives of matrix symbols.",
