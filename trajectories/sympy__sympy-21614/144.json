            "scratch_pad": "To address the reported issue regarding the `kind` attribute of `Derivative` applied to a `MatrixSymbol`, it is crucial to locate the code spans that deal with the evaluation of derivatives and the handling of `MatrixSymbol` objects. The issue specifically identifies incorrect behavior when accessing the `kind` attribute of a `Derivative` object with a `MatrixSymbol` argument, returning `UndefinedKind` instead of the expected kind (e.g., `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`). The provided search results contain several relevant files: `matexpr.py`, `common.py`, and `function.py`, each with code spans that seem pertinent to the reported issue. Here's a detailed breakdown of the analysis:\n\n1. **matexpr.py**: This file contains the definition of `MatrixSymbol` and its derivative evaluation method `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`. This method is essential for understanding how `MatrixSymbol` derivatives are calculated, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand, especially since the problem involves a `Derivative` of a `MatrixSymbol`.\n\n2. **common.py**: This file defines `MatrixKind`, which is the expected kind for a `MatrixSymbol`. The `kind` attribute is critical for the behavior reported in the issue. Understanding how `MatrixKind` is instantiated and used can shed light on why `UndefinedKind` might be returned instead.\n\n3. **function.py**: The `Derivative` class and its methods such as `__new__` and `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` are defined here. This context is crucial because it outlines how `Derivative` objects are created and how they handle different kinds of expressions, including `MatrixSymbol`.\n\nBy examining these files and specifically these methods, we can identify the exact locations in the codebase where the behavior regarding the `kind` attribute and derivative evaluation might deviate from the expected functionality. The spans related to `MatrixSymbol` derivative evaluation and `MatrixKind` will be flagged as highly relevant to the reported issue.",
