The user observes that while `Integral` correctly reflects the kind for `MatrixSymbol`, `Derivative` does not. This suggests that the problem likely resides in how `Derivative` handles `MatrixSymbol`. Given the search results, the relevant code spans are in `sympy/core/function.py` where the `Derivative` class and its `_eval_derivative` method are defined, and in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` where the `MatrixSymbol` class and its derivative evaluation methods are located. These code spans are crucial for understanding and addressing the issue, particularly how `MatrixSymbol` interacts with derivatives. Therefore, both the `Derivative` class's handling of derivatives and `MatrixSymbol`'s derivative evaluations should be considered in the context of the reported issue. This inspection should help in determining if the `kind` attribute for derivatives involving `MatrixSymbol` behaves as expected.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the `kind` attribute for the `Derivative` class, specifically when applied to a `MatrixSymbol`. The issue states that while the `kind` attribute for `Integral` with `MatrixSymbol` is correctly determined as `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, the `Derivative` with `MatrixSymbol` is incorrectly determined as `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy implies an issue with how the `Derivative` class handles `MatrixSymbol` objects. The initial file context provided includes several key spans from `sympy/core/function.py`, notably the `Derivative` class and its methods such as `_eval_derivative` and `_eval_subs`. These are crucial as they define the behavior of the `Derivative` class. Additionally, `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` contains the `MatrixSymbol` class and its `_eval_derivative` method, which indicates how derivatives are evaluated for matrix symbols. The search results provide further insights, including the `ArrayDerivative` class in `sympy/tensor/array/array_derivatives.py` and its associated methods. These methods are relevant as they potentially handle the derivative operations for array-like objects, including matrices. To address the issue, we need to focus on how the `kind` attribute is determined and ensure that the `Derivative` class correctly handles `MatrixSymbol` objects. The provided spans from the search results are relevant as they help in understanding how array and matrix derivatives are computed, potentially providing clues to fix the `kind` attribute issue.",
