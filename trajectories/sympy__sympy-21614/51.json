The expected behavior is for the `kind` attribute to return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` when the `Derivative` is applied to a `MatrixSymbol`, as it does for `Integral`. However, it currently returns `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy suggests a potential bug or oversight in the implementation of the `Derivative` class or its related functionality. Given the relevant files and code snippets provided, the focus should be on the `Derivative` class and its interactions with `MatrixSymbol` and derivatives of matrix expressions. The search should first target the `Derivative` class and its methods, particularly those related to `kind` evaluation or internal derivative handling.",

The user notes that `Integral(A, x).kind` correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but `Derivative(A, x).kind` incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind`. Given this, the focus should be on identifying the relevant code spans within the `Derivative` class and `MatrixSymbol` class that deal with the `kind` attribute or related functionality.\n\nFrom the search results, there are several key spans that are relevant:\n1. The `Derivative.__new__` span in `sympy/core/function.py` where the `Derivative` class is instantiated and various properties are defined, including the `is_commutative` property. This is relevant because the `kind` attribute might need to be set or evaluated here.\n2. The `Derivative._eval_derivative` span in `sympy/core/function.py` which deals with the evaluation of the derivative. This could be crucial for understanding how the `kind` attribute is impacted during differentiation.\n3. The `MatrixSymbol` class and its associated spans in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` are relevant, particularly for understanding how `MatrixSymbol` gets its `kind` attribute or how it interacts with the `Derivative` class when differentiated. Specially focusing on the `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` method, which relates directly to differentiation and the impact on the `kind` attribute.\n\nThese spans provide a comprehensive view of how the `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` classes handle the `kind` attribute and differentiation. By focusing on these sections, the root cause of the `UndefinedKind` issue can be investigated.\n",

The issue specifies that while the `kind` attribute for an `Integral` of a `MatrixSymbol` is correctly set to `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, the `kind` attribute for a `Derivative` of a `MatrixSymbol` is incorrectly set to `UndefinedKind`. This suggests that the logic for setting the `kind` attribute in the `Derivative` class might be missing or incorrect when dealing with matrix expressions.\n\nIn the search results, several relevant spans are identified. The `Derivative` class definition and its methods, such as `__new__`, `_eval_derivative`, and `doit`, are examined. These methods are crucial for understanding how the `Derivative` object is created and how differentiation is handled. The presence of matrix expressions within these methods indicates that the codebase already has some level of support for differentiating matrix expressions. However, the specific handling of the `kind` attribute is not explicitly found in these spans.\n\nAdditionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class and its methods are also examined. The `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` method returns a `ZeroMatrix`, which is expected for derivatives of matrix symbols with respect to scalar variables. However, this does not address the `kind` attribute issue directly.\n\nGiven the provided context and search results, it appears that the relevant code spans primarily focus on the creation and evaluation of derivatives but do not specifically address the `kind` attribute for matrix expressions. This suggests that the search task might not be complete and further investigation is needed to identify where and how the `kind` attribute is set for `Derivative` objects involving matrix expressions.",

The key elements to identify are the `Derivative` class and its handling of `kind` attribute, especially in the context of `MatrixSymbol`. The initial analysis of the provided files and code spans shows several relevant sections such as:\n1. `Derivative.__new__`: This method handles the creation of a `Derivative` object, processing variables and expressions, and includes matrix-related imports and checks.\n2. `Derivative._eval_derivative`: Responsible for evaluating the derivative, crucial for understanding how the `kind` attribute might be affected.\n3. `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative`: Defines the derivative behavior for `MatrixSymbol`, relevant as it directly handles the differentiation of matrices.\n4. `MatrixKind`: A class that handles kinds related to matrices, potentially where the `kind` attribute for matrix derivatives might be defined or affected.\n\nGiven these elements, the search results provide additional insights into these functionalities, and we can narrow down further on the specific spans where adjustments or fixes might be required to handle the `kind` attribute correctly for `Derivative` of `MatrixSymbol`. The focus should be on spans related to `Derivative` internal handling and how matrices are treated, particularly within `_eval_derivative` and related methods. Additionally, the behavior and definition of `MatrixKind` and its integration with `Derivative` need to be closely examined.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, specific spans and files are identified as highly relevant to the reported issue, warranting further investigation or potential modification to resolve the issue.",
