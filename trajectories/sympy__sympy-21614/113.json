The current behavior returns `UndefinedKind` instead of the expected `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. The search results provide context in multiple files, primarily focusing on matrix expressions and derivatives. The relevant code spans are found in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` and `sympy/core/function.py`. In `matexpr.py`, the `MatrixExpr` class and its subclass `MatrixSymbol` are defined, including the `kind` attribute, which is set to `MatrixKind()`. The issue specifically references the `Derivative` class, which is defined in `function.py`. The `Derivative` class's `__new__` method and `_eval_derivative` method are key areas to inspect for potential fixes regarding the `kind` attribute. Additionally, the `MatrixElement` class in `matexpr.py` contains methods for evaluating derivatives, which might be relevant to the reported issue. Considering these findings, the identified code spans provide a sufficient context to delve into the root cause of the issue and implement a solution.",

To address this, we need to understand how the `kind` attribute is determined in the `Derivative` class and how `MatrixSymbol` interacts with it. From the search results and existing context, we have identified relevant sections in the codebase. Specifically, we need to examine how the `Derivative` class handles matrix expressions and how the `MatrixKind` is defined and used within the `MatrixSymbol` class. The `MatrixExpr` class, of which `MatrixSymbol` is a subclass, has a `kind` attribute set to `MatrixKind()`. The `Derivative` class, however, does not seem to properly handle the `kind` when differentiating `MatrixSymbol`. We should focus on the `_eval_derivative` method in `MatrixSymbol` and how `Derivative` interacts with it.",

This could be the reason behind the observed behavior where the 'kind' attribute becomes UndefinedKind after differentiation.
