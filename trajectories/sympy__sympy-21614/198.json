The correct `kind` is MatrixKind(NumberKind) for Integral but UndefinedKind for Derivative. This suggests an issue in the implementation or evaluation of the `kind` attribute for Derivative. Given the provided file context, the focus should be on files that might be directly handling the Derivative class and its attributes, particularly those in the sympy/core and sympy/matrices directories. The Derivative class itself is defined in sympy/core/function.py, while MatrixSymbol and related matrix expressions are handled in sympy/matrices/expressions/*.py. Therefore, the search should concentrate on these files to identify where the `kind` attribute is set or evaluated for Derivative instances involving MatrixSymbol.",

Specifically, the issue is that when using `Derivative(MatrixSymbol, x)`, the `kind` attribute returns `UndefinedKind`, but it should correctly identify the kind of the derivative.\n\nTo address this, we need to identify code spans that are relevant to how the `Derivative` class handles matrix expressions, particularly the `kind` attribute for such derivatives. We also need to look into how the `kind` attribute is set and used in the `Derivative` class and related modules.\n\nFrom the provided search results, there are several relevant spans in the `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` files that deal with the `Derivative` class and matrix expressions. These spans include:\n1. The `Derivative` class and its methods, such as `__new__`, `expr`, `_wrt_variables`, `variables`, `variable_count`, `free_symbols`, and `_eval_as_leading_term`.\n2. The `MatrixSymbol` class and its methods like `shape`, `name`, `free_symbols`, `_eval_derivative`, and `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`.\n3. The `_matrix_derivative` function and the `MatrixElement` class and its methods.\n\nThese spans are relevant because they involve the handling of derivatives, especially with matrix expressions and the `kind` attribute. They also include sections where the derivative is evaluated and where the properties of the derivative and matrix expressions are defined.\n\nBased on the reported issue, these code spans need to be inspected to identify where the `kind` attribute is determined and why it results in `UndefinedKind` when working with matrix expressions.",

The issue specifically mentions the `kind` attribute returning `UndefinedKind` for a `Derivative` of a `MatrixSymbol`, suggesting a mismatch or missing implementation for matrix-specific differentiation. I examined the `Derivative.__new__` method where the differentiation logic is defined and properties like `variable_count` and `variables` which are crucial for handling the differentiation variables. Additionally, I looked into the `MatrixSymbol` class to understand how matrix symbols are handled and differentiated. I also explored the `_matrix_derivative` function for its role in differentiating matrix expressions. Based on the reported issue, the identified code spans likely involve the `Derivative.__new__` method, especially where it processes the expression and variables, and the `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` method to ensure matrix symbols are correctly differentiated. These sections could contribute to an incorrect `kind` attribute or lack of differentiation specialization for matrices, key elements as per the reported issue.",

It is evident from the issue that the `kind` attribute is expected to be 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)' for both Integral and Derivative instances, but it is 'UndefinedKind' for a Derivative instance. This suggests that the `kind` attribute handling in the Derivative class might be missing or incorrectly implemented for MatrixSymbol instances.\n\nIn the current file context, both sympy/core/function.py and sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py have been identified as relevant. Key code spans include the definition of the Derivative class and its methods, particularly concerning the handling of variable_count and the derivative evaluation process. In the MatrixSymbol class, the _eval_derivative method indicates that the derivative with respect to any variable results in a ZeroMatrix, which might need to be revisited to accommodate a 'kind' attribute suitable for matrices.\n\nFrom the new search results, several additional code spans are identified as potentially relevant. These include methods in the Derivative class such as _eval_is_commutative, _eval_derivative, and _eval_subs, which might influence or be influenced by the 'kind' attribute setting. There are also spans in the MatrixElement and MatrixSymbol classes, particularly related to derivative evaluation and attributes.\n\nThe MatrixKind class, although not directly involved in computing derivatives, is referenced as the expected 'kind' attribute for matrix-related expressions. This class might provide a clue or a template for how the 'kind' attribute should be handled in the context of matrices.\n\nTo address the issue, the relevant spans should likely focus on the Derivative class methods dealing with derivative computation involving MatrixSymbol instances, as well as any relevant methods in MatrixSymbol and MatrixElement classes that interact with derivative computations and attribute handling.",
