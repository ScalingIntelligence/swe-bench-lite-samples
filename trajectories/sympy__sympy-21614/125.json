The problem is that the `kind` attribute of the `Derivative` returns 'UndefinedKind', whereas it should return a specific kind related to the matrix. Given the provided context, it's clear that the `Derivative` class and related matrix expressions are spread across multiple files. To address this, we should focus our search on the files related to `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol`, particularly where the `kind` attribute or `_eval_derivative` method is handled. Additionally, the `MatrixKind` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py` might be relevant as it defines the kind for matrix-related expressions.",

From the search results, the key sections to focus on are the properties of the `Derivative` class (like `expr`, `variables`, `variable_count`, and `free_symbols`) and the methods within the `MatrixSymbol` class that might affect differentiation, such as `_eval_derivative` and `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`. These sections of the code are crucial as they directly deal with how derivatives are calculated and how attributes like `kind` might be affected. Furthermore, it's important to note if there are any specific handling or conditions for matrix kinds during differentiation, which is hinted at but not directly shown in the provided spans. Given these points, the next step would be to analyze these elements for any potential issues that might influence the 'kind' attribute of derivatives involving matrices.",

This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the `Derivative` class handling of `MatrixSymbol`. The current file context includes relevant parts of the `Function` and `Derivative` classes in `sympy/core/function.py`, and the `MatrixSymbol` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`.

These sections are relevant to understanding how `Derivative` processes `MatrixSymbol` and how `kind` attribute might be adjusted or implemented for proper differentiation. Additionally, `MatrixKind` in `sympy/matrices/common.py` confirms how `kind` is defined for matrices, which could inform how `Derivative` should handle such cases. Therefore, the identified spans provide a comprehensive understanding of the codebase regarding the issue, ensuring they can be used for further implementation or debugging.",

The `MatrixSymbol` class involves differentiation, but the logic presented does not automatically integrate `kind` establishment. Further examination of how `kind` gets established along with a derivative, especially with a `MatrixSymbol`, might involve strategies connected to how the kind is structured for `Integral` versus `Derivative`. Additional investigation into handling kind within differentiation logic of other types (like `NumberKind`, 'UndefinedKind' etc.) might also guide us towards applying similar logic to `MatrixKind` when deriving. Thus, focusing on how differences in entities are processed when differentials and partial derivatives, including those concerning `MatrixSymbol` objects, might be instructive to incorporate the `MatrixKind` attribute into development.

The correct behavior for an `Integral` of a `MatrixSymbol` is to return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but the `Derivative` returns `UndefinedKind`. This suggests a need to investigate the `Derivative` class and its interaction with `MatrixSymbol` to ensure the `kind` attribute is correctly assigned and handled for matrix types.\n\nGiven the context, it's essential to look at the `Derivative` class methods such as `__new__`, `variable_count`, and `canonical` that are directly involved in defining and managing derivatives. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class and its methods like `_eval_derivative` are relevant since they deal with matrix-specific differentiation.\n\nThe search results confirm the presence of these methods in the codebase, especially in `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. These methods are analyzed to identify if the `kind` attribute is correctly set or if there's a need for modification to handle matrix derivatives appropriately.\n\nAfter examining the provided snippets, the relevant sections include the `Derivative` constructor and its internal logic for handling variables and expressions, particularly with matrices. The `MatrixSymbol` differentiation methods are also crucial as they define how matrices should behave under differentiation. This analysis helps in determining if these methods need adjustments to correctly assign and manage the `kind` attribute for matrix derivatives.",

The `Derivative` class contains a comprehensive handling of differentiation, including special cases and error checking, but lacks a direct reference to `kind` attribute processing in its methods. The `MatrixSymbol` class involves differentiation, but the logic presented does not automatically integrate `kind` establishment. Further examination of how `kind` gets established along with a derivative, especially with a `MatrixSymbol`, might involve strategies connected to how the kind is structured for `Integral` versus `Derivative`. Additional investigation into handling kind within differentiation logic of other types (like `NumberKind`, 'UndefinedKind' etc.) might also guide us towards applying similar logic to `MatrixKind` when deriving. Thus, focusing on how differences in entities are processed when differentials and partial derivatives, including those concerning `MatrixSymbol` objects, might be instructive to incorporate the `MatrixKind` attribute into development. Moreover, investigation into any utility functions or missing definitions in `MatrixKind`, especially related to differentiating with symbols orMatrixSymbol objects, is crucial for crafting the appropriate kind for a differentiate of a MatrixSymbol.",
