The incorrect behavior is that the kind attribute of a Derivative object is 'UndefinedKind' when it should reflect the MatrixKind(NumberKind) as seen in the Integral example. Considering the provided files, the focus should be on the Derivative class in `sympy/core/function.py` and the `_eval_derivative` and `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` methods in the MatrixExpr related files.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the `kind` attribute of the `Derivative` class when operating on a `MatrixSymbol`. The issue presents two scenarios: one where `Integral` correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` and another where `Derivative` incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy suggests that the `Derivative` class is not handling the `kind` attribute properly when applied to matrix expressions. My analysis of the provided search results indicates that the `Derivative` class, defined in 'sympy/core/function.py', contains multiple methods and properties relevant to differentiating expressions, including handling of matrix expressions. Notably, there are properties like `expr`, `_wrt_variables`, `variables`, and `variable_count`, which are directly related to the differentiation process and the variables involved. These could be essential in determining the kind of derivative, especially when dealing with matrix symbols. Additionally, the constructor method `__new__` contains specific handling for matrix expressions, indicating that matrix-specific differentiation logic might be implemented here. This method also imports and handles various matrix types such as `MatrixExpr`, `Array`, and `NDimArray`, suggesting a deeper integration of matrix differentiation logic within the `Derivative` class. Based on this analysis, the relevant code spans would be those handling the creation and evaluation of derivatives specifically for matrix expressions to address the issue of incorrect `kind` attribute. The identified spans include the constructor `__new__`, properties related to variables and expression handling, and potentially other methods that interact with or derive from these properties. Given the context and the discrepancy outlined in the issue, focusing on these spans should provide a comprehensive understanding and potential resolution for the identified problem.",

The key areas to investigate are the initialization of `Derivative` (`Derivative.__new__`), properties related to differentiation variables (`Derivative.variables`, `Derivative.variable_count`), and the canonical representation (`Derivative.canonical`). The issue suggests that the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` should be `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` but is returning `UndefinedKind`, indicating a potential problem with how `Derivative` handles matrix types. We should look for code spans where matrix types are processed or where the `kind` attribute is set or inferred. The search results include relevant spans from `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/*.py`, which contain methods like `Derivative.__new__` and properties like `Derivative.variables`. These spans should be evaluated for their relevance to the issue.",

Specifically, the `__new__` method of the `Derivative` class does not explicitly set the `kind` attribute. It primarily handles differentiation logic without mentioning `kind`.

To resolve this, it's essential to identify sections of the code where the `kind` attribute would be appropriately set or updated within the `Derivative` class or during the computation involving MatrixSymbol. It appears that currently, neither `_eval_derivative` nor `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` methods explicitly manage the `kind` attribute in the MatrixExpr module.

The issue notes that while the `kind` attribute of an `Integral` with a `MatrixSymbol` is correctly identified, the `kind` attribute of a `Derivative` with a `MatrixSymbol` is not, returning `UndefinedKind`. The search results include multiple spans of code from various files, notably the sympy/core/function.py and sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py files, which contain the `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` classes, respectively.\n\nFirst, I analyzed the `Derivative` class in sympy/core/function.py. The `Derivative.__new__` method is responsible for creating new instances of `Derivative`, including handling the differentiation of `MatrixSymbol`. However, the current implementation does not explicitly handle the `kind` attribute for `MatrixSymbol`.\n\nNext, I reviewed the `MatrixSymbol` class in sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py. This class includes methods related to differentiation and handling derivatives. Notably, the `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines` method is involved in determining how to differentiate the `MatrixSymbol`, but it does not address the `kind` attribute directly.\n\nGiven the issue's focus on the `kind` attribute, it is crucial to identify the sections of code that might be responsible for handling this attribute. The relevant code spans are those in the `Derivative` class where the `kind` attribute might be assigned or where its handling might be implemented. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class might need adjustments to ensure that the `kind` attribute is correctly propagated when differentiating.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those within the `Derivative` class constructor (`__new__`) and the `MatrixSymbol` class's derivative methods. These sections are critical for addressing the reported issue, as they handle the core functionality related to differentiation and handling the `kind` attribute.",

The `MatrixSymbol` class in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' is also present, demonstrating how derivatives are handled in terms of matrix lines, but these methods do not address the `kind` attribute explicitly. This indicates that the relevant codebase section lacks the direct implementation needed to solve the reported issue regarding the `kind` attribute in matrix derivatives. Despite the presence of various derivative evaluation methods in different matrix expression modules, none directly address the setting or modification of the `kind` attribute as required by the issue.
