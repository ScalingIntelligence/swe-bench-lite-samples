The provided example shows that for an `Integral`, the `kind` attribute correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. However, for a `Derivative`, it incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind`. This suggests that the problem might lie in the implementation of the `Derivative` class specifically when handling matrix expressions. Therefore, the focus should be on files and code spans related to the `Derivative` class, especially those dealing with matrix expressions and derivatives.",

Specifically, the issue shows that while `Integral` returns a `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` when applied to a `MatrixSymbol`, `Derivative` returns `UndefinedKind`. The search results include several relevant files such as sympy/core/function.py which contains the `Derivative` class implementation, and sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py which contains the `MatrixSymbol` and related matrix expressions. Particularly, the code in matexpr.py includes functions for derivative calculations (`_matrix_derivative` and `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines`), and these are likely places to look for the bug or the logic that might need to be adjusted to handle the 'kind' attribute correctly. The common.py file includes the `MatrixKind` class definition which is mentioned in the expected output of the issue. In addition, the function.py file contains various evaluation methods for the `Derivative` class which might also be relevant to the issue. Therefore, these code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they involve calculations and definitions that are directly or indirectly related to the `MatrixSymbol` derivative and its 'kind' attribute.",

The provided example shows that for an `Integral`, the `kind` attribute correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. However, for a `Derivative`, it incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind`. This suggests that the problem might lie in the implementation of the `Derivative` class specifically when handling matrix expressions. The file context provided includes code related to the `Derivative` class and its handling of matrix expressions in the `matexpr.py` and `function.py` files. It appears that the `Derivative` class and its methods are indeed involved in the handling of derivatives, including those of matrix expressions. The `MatrixSymbol` class also has methods related to differentiation, indicating that these parts of the code are relevant to the issue. The `MatrixKind` class, responsible for defining the kind of matrix elements, is also present, which is significant for understanding the kind attribute behavior. Therefore, the provided file context seems sufficient to address the issue involving the `kind` attribute of derivatives of matrix expressions.",
