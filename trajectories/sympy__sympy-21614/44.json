This discrepancy suggests a need to investigate how the `kind` attribute is determined and set within the `Derivative` class, particularly when applied to matrix expressions. The search results include several relevant sections from sympy: in `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Derivative` class and related methods (`Derivative.__new__`, `Derivative.canonical`, `Derivative.variables`, `Derivative.variable_count`, `Derivative.free_symbols`) are found. These methods directly deal with how derivatives are instantiated and manipulated, making them key to understanding the behavior of the `kind` attribute. Additionally, in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, the `MatrixSymbol` class and its derivative evaluation methods (`MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative`, `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines`) are relevant, as they pertain to differentiating matrix expressions. The `sympy/core/kind.py` file contains the `KindMeta` and `KindDispatcher` classes that might be involved in type or kind determination for SymPy objects. However, no direct relation to derivatives on matrix symbols is immediately apparent in this file. Lastly, in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py`, the `MatMul` class and its derivative evaluation method (`MatMul._eval_derivative_matrix_lines`) are found, which could indirectly influence derivative evaluation involving matrix multiplication but are less directly relevant to the issue at hand compared to the `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` classes.",

The expected behavior is for the `kind` attribute of the `Derivative` of a `MatrixSymbol` to return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but currently, it returns `UndefinedKind`. This indicates that the `kind` attribute handling in the `Derivative` class needs to be reviewed, especially when the expression being differentiated is a `MatrixSymbol`. The search results include the `Derivative` class and the `MatrixSymbol` class, both of which are relevant to addressing the issue. The `Derivative.__new__` method and the `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` method are particularly relevant as they handle the creation and differentiation of these expressions, respectively. Additionally, the `Derivative.canonical` property is relevant as it relates to how the derivative is represented. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the `kind` attribute in the `Derivative` class and the differentiation of `MatrixSymbol` objects.",
