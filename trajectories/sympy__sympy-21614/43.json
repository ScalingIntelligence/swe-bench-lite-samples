The incorrect behavior is observed when a MatrixSymbol is used within a Derivative, which returns 'UndefinedKind'. The correct behavior should return 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)' similar to the Integral object.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, several files and spans contain relevant code related to MatrixSymbol, Derivative, and their attributes. The 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' file contains definitions for the MatrixExpr and MatrixSymbol classes, which include the 'kind' attribute. The MatrixExpr class has a 'kind' attribute set to MatrixKind, which seems relevant to the issue. Additionally, the '_eval_derivative_matrix_lines' method in the MatrixSymbol class is relevant for understanding how derivatives are evaluated, potentially influencing the 'kind' attribute.\n\nIn 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py', 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matpow.py', and 'sympy/matrices/expressions/applyfunc.py', various methods related to matrix operations and derivatives are found. These include '_eval_derivative_matrix_lines' methods in MatMul and ElementwiseApplyFunction classes, which handle evaluation of derivatives differently. These could indirectly influence the behavior of the 'kind' attribute.\n\nGiven the analysis, I will mark relevant spans that touch upon the 'kind' attribute, MatrixSymbol, Derivative, and derivative evaluation methods, as these are directly or indirectly relevant to the reported issue.",

This class is relevant as it represents matrix symbols used in derivatives. The issue seems to be that when using `Derivative` with a matrix symbol, the `kind` attribute returns `UndefinedKind`. The file context provides the necessary classes (`MatrixExpr`, `MatrixSymbol`, etc.) and their methods related to matrix expressions and derivatives. However, the specific method in `Derivative` that sets or returns the `kind` attribute is not provided, nor is the `UndefinedKind` class or its definition.

The `MatPow` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matpow.py` deals with powers of matrices and also includes a derivative evaluation method.

The issue mentions that the `kind` attribute of `Derivative` returns `UndefinedKind` which is incorrect. I should look for the code where this attribute is defined or computed.\n\n1. **Analyzing <issue>:**\n   - The issue reports incorrect `kind` attribute for `Derivative`.\n   - Expected `kind` for `Integral` is `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` but for `Derivative` it is `UndefinedKind`.\n\n2. **Review of Current Context:**\n   - The `kind` attribute is already mentioned in the `MatrixExpr` class.\n   - The `MatrixSymbol` class inherits from `MatrixExpr` and has a method `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`.\n\n3. **Process New Search Results:**\n   - In `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Derivative` class is defined.\n   - The `Derivation.expr` property extracts the expression from the `Derivative` object.\n   - There is a `Derivative.kind` property in the code but it is not implemented.\n\n4. **Relevant Code Spans:**\n   - The `Derivative` class definition.\n   - The `Derivative.expr` property.\n\nThe above code spans are relevant because they directly involve the `Derivative` class and its attributes which is central to the issue being reported.\n\nIt's crucial to understand that the current implementation of `Kind` in `Derivative` is limited or not properly addressed based on the search results and the missing attribute in the `Derivative` class. This highlights the need for an implementation of `kind` attribute in `Derivative` similar to what is done in `Integral` to solve the problem effectively.",

The key elements to focus on are the `Derivative` class, the `MatrixSymbol` class, and the `MatrixKind` class. The `Derivative` class is expected to handle the differentiation of matrix expressions correctly, and the `kind` attribute should reflect the type of the matrix being differentiated. The provided search results include definitions and methods related to `Derivative`, `MatrixSymbol`, and `Kind` classes, which are relevant to understanding how the `kind` attribute is determined and how differentiation is handled for matrix expressions. Notably, the `Derivative.__new__` method handles the creation of derivative expressions and includes logic for determining if the derivative should be zero based on the variables and their counts. The `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines` method also provides insight into how derivatives are computed for matrix symbols. The `KindDispatcher` and `Kind` classes are also included, which likely handle the determination of the `kind` attribute, although the specific logic for `MatrixKind` is not directly provided. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue, but further investigation might be needed to fully understand and resolve the issue with the `kind` attribute in `Derivative`.",

This should be handled in the '__new__' method of the Derivative class, specifically where the expression type is checked and the kind attribute is assigned.\n\nThe instructions require modifying the '__new__' method of the Derivative class to handle the setting of the 'kind' attribute to 'MatrixKind' when the expression being differentiated is a MatrixExpr. The relevant section of the code to modify is within the '__new__' method, likely around where the expression type is checked and the 'kind' attribute is assigned or initialized.",
