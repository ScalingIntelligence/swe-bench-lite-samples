The issue points out that while the `Integral` of a `MatrixSymbol` correctly returns a `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, the `Derivative` of the same `MatrixSymbol` returns an `UndefinedKind`, which is incorrect. This discrepancy suggests that the `kind` attribute handling for `Derivative` instances might have an underlying issue. From the search results, several key parts of the code related to the `Derivative` class are identified. These include the `Derivative.__new__` method, which initializes a `Derivative` object and handles the differentiation process, and the `Derivative._eval_derivative` method, which is responsible for computing the derivative. These sections are marked as relevant as they directly relate to the creation and evaluation of derivatives, which is central to the reported issue. Additionally, the `Derivative.canonical` property is included for its role in ensuring the canonical form of a `Derivative` instance.",

The `kind` attribute seems to be related to the type or category of the mathematical object, and it appears that `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` is expected for derivatives involving matrices.

The context includes multiple spans related to the `Derivative` class, covering its constructor, evaluation methods, and sorting of variables. The search results in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` provide additional context about how matrix expressions are handled, including the `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol` classes. Notably, the `MatrixExpr` class has a `kind` attribute indicating `MatrixKind()`, which aligns with the correct behavior described in the issue for the `Integral` class.
