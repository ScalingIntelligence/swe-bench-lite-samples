The `kind` attribute is incorrectly being set to `UndefinedKind` rather than the expected `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. This suggests a potential bug or misconfiguration in the handling of the `kind` attribute within the `Derivative` class or related matrix expression classes. To address this, we should focus our search on the `Derivative` class and its interactions with matrix-related classes, particularly where the `kind` attribute is defined or manipulated.",

The issue points out that `Integral` of a `MatrixSymbol` returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, while `Derivative` returns `UndefinedKind`, which is incorrect. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts in the codebase that deal with the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol`. From the search results, the following are likely relevant:\n\n1. **MatrixSymbol and its derivative handling**:\n   - `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py::MatrixSymbol`\n   - This class likely has methods related to derivatives, especially `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`.\n\n2. **Derivative class and its methods**:\n   - `sympy/core/function.py::Derivative`\n   - This class has methods like `__new__`, `_eval_derivative`, and others that might need adjustment to handle the `kind` attribute correctly.\n\n3. **ArrayDerivative class**:\n   - `sympy/tensor/array/array_derivatives.py::ArrayDerivative`\n   - This class extends `Derivative` and might be involved in handling derivatives of matrix expressions.\n\nGiven the issue's focus on `kind` attribute consistency, the identified spans in `MatrixSymbol`, `Derivative`, and potentially `ArrayDerivative` are crucial for understanding and fixing the problem.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the `kind` attribute in the `Derivative` class, specifically for a `MatrixSymbol` instance. The current context already identifies relevant files and spans focusing on sympy/core/function.py and sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py. The issue highlights incorrect behavior in the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` objects involving `MatrixSymbol`. New search results bring additional context, especially in sympy/core/function.py, providing methods like `__new__`, `_eval_is_commutative`, `_eval_derivative`, and `_eval_subs` for `Derivative` class. These methods are critical for understanding how `Derivative` objects are created, differentiated, and substituted. Additional spans in sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py provide `free_symbols` and differentiation methods for `MatrixSymbol`, crucial for matrix expressions and differentiation. The rest of the search results involve other classes possibly related to derivatives and matrix operations, which provide a broader understanding of the codebase and potential intersections with the reported issue.",

After analyzing the provided search results and the existing context, I have identified several relevant code spans: 1. The `MatrixSymbol` class and its `_eval_derivative` method, which returns a `ZeroMatrix`. 2. The `Derivative` class and its `__new__` method, which handles the creation of derivative objects. 3. The `_derivative_dispatch` function, which dispatches the differentiation operation based on the type of the expression. These code spans are relevant because they deal with the differentiation of matrix expressions and handle the creation and evaluation of derivative objects, which is directly related to the issue of the `kind` attribute. The provided search results and context do not cover the exact logic for determining the `kind` attribute of a `Derivative`, but they cover the surrounding context necessary to understand and potentially modify the `kind` attribute behavior.

The `kind` attribute is crucial for maintaining type information across different kinds of objects in SymPy, including matrices. In the `MatrixSymbol` class, the `kind` attribute is set to `MatrixKind()`, which correctly identifies it as a matrix. However, when `MatrixSymbol` is used within `Derivative`, the `kind` attribute does not properly propagate or handle the matrix kind, resulting in `UndefinedKind`. The file context provided includes the relevant classes and methods where this interaction occurs. The `__new__` method in the `Derivative` class is where the differentiation process starts, and it is crucial to ensure that the `kind` attribute propagates correctly when differentiating matrix expressions. The `_eval_derivative` method in the `MatrixSymbol` class provides a default behavior for differentiation, but it does not address the matrix kind specifically. Given the existing code, it seems that the appropriate code snippets related to the issue are provided, though not in explicit functionality that directly fixes the kind attribute issue.",

Specifically, code elements that handle the dispatch of derivatives with matrix expressions and the instantiation of `Derivative` with matrix kinds should be carefully reviewed. Additionally, it might be helpful to explore how the `kind` attribute behaves during symbolic manipulation and substitution within derivative expressions."
