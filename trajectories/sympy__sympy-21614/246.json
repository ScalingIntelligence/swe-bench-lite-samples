When taking the derivative of a `MatrixSymbol` with respect to a variable, the `kind` attribute is incorrectly returning `UndefinedKind`. The search results focus on the `MatrixSymbol` class within the `sympy.matrices.expressions.matexpr` module. This is relevant because the issue involves a `MatrixSymbol` object in the context of differentiation. Specifically, the spans that are of high relevance are those where the `MatrixSymbol` class is defined and where its derivative is evaluated, as well as the initialization and the method for free symbols, as these could influence how the kind attribute is assigned or accessed. However, it's important to note that the search results do not directly include the `Derivative` class handling the `MatrixSymbol` case, suggesting a need to expand the search beyond this module or to examine other parts of the codebase that might interact with the `Derivative` class in handling matrices.",

To address this, we need to look into the `Derivative` class and where the `kind` attribute is defined or inferred. From the provided search results, the `Derivative` class definition and its properties are indeed relevant. Specifically, the `kind` attribute is not explicitly defined in the `Derivative` class, and the issue might be related to how the `Derivative` class handles the kind attribute, especially for non-scalar expressions like `MatrixSymbol`. The `Derivative` class has properties like `_diff_wrt`, `variables`, `variable_count`, and methods like `doit` and `_eval_derivative` which will be crucial in determining how the kind attribute is processed. These parts of the code will be essential for fixing the issue where the kind attribute for `Derivative` should correctly identify and return the kind of the matrix symbol being differentiated.",

            "scratch_pad": "Analyzing the reported issue, the focus is on the `kind` attribute of the `Derivative` class when applied to a `MatrixSymbol`. The issue provides a correct example where `Integral(A, x).kind` returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but an incorrect example where `Derivative(A, x).kind` returns `UndefinedKind`. This suggests that the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` applied to `MatrixSymbol` is not correctly defined or implemented.\n\nReviewing the current file context in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, it is observed that the `MatrixSymbol` class is defined with `MatrixKind()` for the `kind` attribute. However, the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py` does not seem to have explicit handling for the `kind` attribute when differentiating with respect to `MatrixSymbol`.\n\nExamining the provided search results, it appears that the `Derivative.__new__` method does not include explicit checks or handling for `MatrixSymbol` instances, which could explain why the `kind` attribute is not set correctly. This lack of handling for `MatrixSymbol` in differentiation logic could be the root cause of the issue. Analyzing the `Derivative` class further, especially in the context of `expr` being a `MatrixSymbol`, may reveal necessary changes to accommodate the correct `kind` attribute derivation. Thus, the task is to identify or implement such handling in the `Derivative` class to ensure correct `kind` attribute population for `MatrixSymbol` derivatives.\n\nGiven the search results and the existing codebase examination, it is clear that the current implementation of the `Derivative` class does not account for `MatrixSymbol` kinds during the differentiation process, leading to the `UndefinedKind` issue reported.",
