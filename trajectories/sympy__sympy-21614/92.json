The issue highlights that while `Integral(A, x)` correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` for a `MatrixSymbol A`, `Derivative(A, x)` returns `UndefinedKind` instead of the expected kind. This suggests a problem with how `Derivative` handles the `kind` attribute specifically for matrix expressions. The search results cover the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py` and the `MatrixExpr` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. The analysis of these results reveals that the `Derivative` class includes methods like `__new__`, `_eval_derivative` and also a dispatch function `_derivative_dispatch`. These are critical for understanding how derivatives are created and evaluated in SymPy. Additionally, `MatrixExpr` in the `matexpr.py` file includes the `_eval_derivative` method, which is also relevant to the differentiation of matrix expressions. Given the issue involves matrix derivatives and their kinds, these sections of the code are directly relevant to addressing the problem.",

From the `file_context`, we see that the `Derivative` class is defined in `sympy/core/function.py` and has methods like `__new__` and `_eval_derivative`. Additionally, there are relevant spans in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` that involve `MatrixSymbol` and its `_eval_derivative` method. In the `search_results`, there are multiple spans in `sympy/core/function.py` including `Derivative.canonical`, `Derivative._sort_variable_count`, and `Derivative._eval_derivative`. These spans could potentially be related to the issue due to their involvement in differentiation and handling of derivative objects. Furthermore, in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, spans related to `MatrixSymbol` and its `_eval_derivative` method are present, suggesting that these are key areas to examine for solving the issue regarding the `UndefinedKind` return value for derivatives of matrix expressions.",
