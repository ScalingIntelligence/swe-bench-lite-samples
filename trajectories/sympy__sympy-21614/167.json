The issue notes that while the `kind` attribute for an `Integral` of a `MatrixSymbol` correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, the `kind` attribute for a `Derivative` of the same `MatrixSymbol` returns `UndefinedKind`, which is incorrect. This suggests that the `Derivative` class may not be correctly handling the `kind` attribute for matrix expressions. The search results include the definition of the `Derivative` class and its `__new__` method from `sympy/core/function.py`, which is crucial for understanding how the derivative is created and how the `kind` attribute might be managed. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class from `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` is included, which is relevant as the issue pertains to differentiation involving `MatrixSymbol`. The `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` method within `MatrixSymbol` is particularly relevant as it deals with derivative calculations specifically for matrix expressions. These two sections of code are likely where the fix for the incorrect `kind` attribute would need to be implemented.",

The provided context shows that the `kind` attribute returns 'UndefinedKind' for the `Derivative` of a `MatrixSymbol`, which is incorrect behavior compared to the expected 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)' for an `Integral` of the same `MatrixSymbol`. Given this, the relevant code spans should focus on the `Derivative` class and its handling of matrix expressions, particularly the `MatrixSymbol` class. The new search results confirm the presence of the `Derivative` class and its relevant methods, such as `__new__`, `canonical`, and various properties related to differentiation and variable handling. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class and its derivative evaluation methods are also present, which align with the issue reported. Based on this analysis, the identified code spans cover the necessary components to address the issue regarding the `kind` attribute of the `Derivative` class when dealing with matrix expressions.",

To address the issue, it's necessary to either modify existing methods to include `kind` handling or introduce new methods in both classes that manage this attribute appropriately. Given the extensive handling of differentiation logic in `Derivative`, we should focus on extending its capabilities to manage the `kind` attribute.

The user observed that while `Integral(A, x)` correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, `Derivative(A, x)` returns `UndefinedKind`, which is incorrect. This discrepancy indicates a potential issue in the `Derivative` class when handling matrix-related differentiation.\n\n1. **Analyzing User Instructions:** The user provides an example where `Derivative(A, x)` does not return the expected `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` but instead returns `UndefinedKind`.\n\n2. **Review Current Context:** The current file context includes relevant parts of `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. These files contain the `Derivative` class and the `MatrixSymbol` class, which are key to understanding and resolving the issue.\n\n3. **Process New Search Results:**\n   - **Review `Derivative` Class:** The new search results provide additional methods within the `Derivative` class, such as `_eval_derivative` and `canonical`. These methods are crucial for understanding how derivatives are computed and how the `kind` attribute might be affected.\n   - **Review `MatrixSymbol` Class:** The `MatrixSymbol` class's methods, especially `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`, show how derivatives are handled for matrices. This is relevant because the issue specifically involves matrix differentiation.\n\n4. **Identified Relevant Spans:**\n   - From `sympy/core/function.py`: `Derivative.__new__`, `Derivative.canonical`, and `Derivative._eval_derivative` are relevant because they deal directly with the creation and evaluation of derivatives.\n   - From `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`: `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines` is relevant as it shows how the derivative lines are evaluated for matrices.\n\nThese identified spans should help in understanding and potentially fixing the issue with the `kind` attribute in `Derivative` when applied to matrices.",
