            "scratch_pad": "Based on the reported issue, the focus is on the `kind` attribute of the `Derivative` class when applied to `MatrixSymbol`. The issue points out that while `Integral` applied to `MatrixSymbol` returns a `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, `Derivative` applied to `MatrixSymbol` returns an `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy indicates a potential bug or inconsistency in the handling of the `kind` attribute by the `Derivative` class specifically when dealing with matrix expressions. The search results provided relevant code spans from `sympy/core/function.py`, `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, and `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`. These files contain definitions and methods related to `Derivative`, `MatrixSymbol`, and matrix calculus functionalities, which are directly related to the reported issue. Specifically, the `Derivative` class definition and its methods in `sympy/core/function.py` are critically examined, as they deal with the computation and properties of derivatives. Additionally, `MatrixSymbol` class and the `MatrixCalculus` class are of interest as they pertain to matrix expressions and their calculus-related operations. The analysis involves scrutinizing methods such as `__new__`, `doit`, `doit_numerically`, `_eval_derivative`, and properties like `kind` within the `Derivative` class, as well as properties and methods in the `MatrixSymbol` and `MatrixCalculus` classes that could influence the `kind` attribute's behavior or its interaction with matrix types. Since the issue is about the `kind` attribute returning `UndefinedKind` for `Derivative` with `MatrixSymbol`, understanding how `Derivative` handles matrix types and what triggers `UndefinedKind` is essential. This involves closely checking how the `kind` attribute is set or computed in `Derivative` when the expression involves `MatrixSymbol` and how these interactions are managed.",

The correct behavior should be similar to `Integral(MatrixSymbol('A', 2, 2), x).kind`, which returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, we need to identify the code spans that handle the `kind` attribute and the differentiation of `MatrixSymbol`. The relevant spans include the definition of `Derivative`, its `__new__`, `doit`, `_eval_derivative`, and `_diff_wrt` methods, as well as the `MatrixSymbol` class and its `_eval_derivative` method.\n\nThe search results provide additional insights into how differentiation is handled, particularly in `ArrayDerivative` and its methods for handling different types of expressions. These are crucial for understanding how to implement or fix the `kind` attribute behavior for derivatives of matrices.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are identified in the response.",
