The provided example shows that the kind attribute for Integral correctly returns MatrixKind(NumberKind), suggesting that the attribute logic for Integral might be correctly implemented. In contrast, the kind attribute for Derivative returns UndefinedKind, indicating an issue in the implementation of the kind attribute for derivatives involving MatrixSymbol. Hence, the search should focus on the Derivative class within matrix expression contexts.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue involves the 'kind' attribute for a `Derivative` instance, specifically when applied to a `MatrixSymbol`, where it is expected to return 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)' but instead returns 'UndefinedKind'. Given this, the focus should be on the `Derivative` class and its methods related to the kind attribute. The provided search results offer insights into the `Derivative` class and its various methods. Notably, the `Derivative.__new__` method initializes the `Derivative` object, and the `Derivative.expr` property accesses the expression to be differentiated. There are also methods related to differentiating the expression, such as `_eval_derivative` and `doit`. Given the issue, it is crucial to identify where the 'kind' attribute might be assigned or where the logic related to determining the kind is implemented. However, the search results do not explicitly show a method or property named 'kind' or directly related to the way the 'kind' attribute is determined for a `Derivative` object. This suggests that while these code spans offer context for what the `Derivative` class does, they do not directly address the 'kind' attribute discrepancy mentioned in the issue. Further search or a deeper look into the `kind` attribute handling within the `Derivative` class might be necessary to resolve the issue.",

The current context includes the `kind` definition in `kind.py` and the `ArrayDerivative` class in `array_derivatives.py`. The new search results provide insights into the `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol` classes which are crucial for understanding how the `kind` attribute is set and used in matrix expressions. Specifically, the `MatrixSymbol` class defines the `kind` attribute as `MatrixKind()`, which should align with the expected output when differentiating `MatrixSymbol` instances. The task is to find the relevant code spans that handle the `kind` attribute in the `Derivative` class to ensure it correctly reflects the kind of the expression being differentiated. By examining the `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol` classes, we identify the `kind` attribute settings and their potential usage in derivative calculations. This approach helps in pinpointing where the `UndefinedKind` might be incorrectly assigned, leading to the reported issue. Thus, the relevant code spans are those handling the `kind` attribute in `Derivative`, `MatrixExpr`, and `MatrixSymbol`.",

However, the specific handling of 'MatrixKind' within the Derivative class is still not explicitly defined in the provided context, and the ArrayDerivative class in 'sympy/tensor/array/array_derivatives.py' also doesn't directly address how the 'kind' attribute is assigned for MatrixSymbol derivatives.

The user noticed discrepancies in the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` and `Integral` instances involving a `MatrixSymbol`. The key focus is on the attribute's behavior and specifically why `Derivative(MatrixSymbol('A', 2, 2), x).kind` returns `UndefinedKind` while `Integral(MatrixSymbol('A', 2, 2), x).kind` returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`.\n\nThe current context provides insights into the classes and methods dealing with `kind` and the `Derivative` class, but it doesn't directly show the logic or resolution for the reported problem. The new search results are crucial as they include: the `Derivative` class definition in `sympy/core/function.py`, which could reveal how the `kind` attribute is being set or computed for derivatives; and extended sections of `KindDispatcher` in `sympy/core/kind.py`, showing dispatch mechanisms and how they might relate to or solve the issue by correctly determining the kind for objects like `Derivative(MatrixSymbol, ...)`.\n\nI need to closely examine the '__new__' method and possibly other associated methods or properties of the `Derivative` class in the search results to see how and where the 'kind' attribute is handled. Additionally, the 'dispatch_kinds' method of `KindDispatcher` could be the place where the mistake or miscalculation occurs, necessitating a closer look to ensure it properly processes dispatch for the kind attribute and to potentially discover how to adjust it to fix the issue.",

Additionally, the ArrayDerivative class in 'sympy/tensor/array/array_derivatives.py' provides insight into how derivatives are handled for arrays and matrices, though it doesn't directly address the 'kind' attribute for MatrixSymbol derivatives. Furthermore, the MatrixExpr and MatrixSymbol classes in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' contribute to the understanding of how kinds are generally applied to matrix expressions, with MatrixSymbol having a default kind of MatrixKind(). However, the specific issue regarding the 'kind' attribute of Derivative involving MatrixSymbol remains unresolved as the direct assignment or determination logic is not found in the provided context. This suggests that further investigation is needed into how Derivative's 'kind' attribute is determined in complex scenarios involving MatrixSymbol, potentially focusing on how KindDispatcher interacts with these types or examining other parts of the codebase that handle derivative-related computations.",
