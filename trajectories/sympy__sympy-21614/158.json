The expected behavior is for the `kind` attribute to return 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)' for both `Integral` and `Derivative` when applied to a `MatrixSymbol`. However, the actual behavior is that the `Derivative` returns 'UndefinedKind', indicating a bug. To address this, it's necessary to examine the `Derivative` class and how it interacts with other classes, especially `MatrixSymbol`. The search results include several spans of code from `sympy/core/function.py`, which is likely where the relevant code for the `Derivative` class resides. Notably, there are spans that define the `Derivative` class itself, how it handles new instances, and properties like `expr`, `variables`, and `free_symbols`. Although these spans provide insight into how the `Derivative` class operates, there is no direct evidence of the `kind` attribute's handling. The search also includes results from `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, which defines the `MatrixSymbol` class but does not directly relate to the `kind` attribute or its behavior with `Derivative`. Based on the provided search results, while they offer context, none of the code spans directly address the `kind` attribute issue. Further examination or additional search may be necessary to pinpoint where the `UndefinedKind` behavior is determined or altered.",

The correct behavior should return a `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` for `Integral` and an `UndefinedKind` for `Derivative`. The provided context and search results include code spans from `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. These code spans cover the `Derivative` class, its `__new__` method, and related properties. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class and its `_eval_derivative` method are relevant. However, the key issue lies in identifying where the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` of a `MatrixSymbol` is set or computed, which is not explicitly covered in the provided spans. Given the current code and search results, the relevant code spans for further investigation and potential solution are those dealing with the `kind` attribute of `Derivative` and how it interacts with `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol`. While the search results do not directly address the `kind` attribute in the context of `Derivative`, they provide a foundation for where the issue might be addressed. Further investigation into the `Derivative` class and its interactions with `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol` is necessary to determine the correct course of action. The files and code spans identified as relevant are those containing the implementation of `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol`, as these are the primary classes involved in the reported issue.",

Specifically, when the derivative is taken of a `MatrixSymbol`, the `kind` attribute should be `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but it is instead `UndefinedKind`. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans where the `kind` attribute is assigned or influenced. Examining the provided search results, the key spans are those dealing with the `Derivative` class and its methods, particularly the `__new__` method which initializes the `Derivative` object. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class and its differentiation behavior are relevant. Based on this analysis, the identified spans focus on these areas, ensuring we capture the necessary logic surrounding derivative creation and matrix expression handling.",
