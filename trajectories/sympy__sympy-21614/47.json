The correct behavior for `Integral` is to return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, whereas `Derivative` returns `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy suggests that the `kind` attribute handling in `Derivative` is not correctly implemented for matrix expressions. From the provided file context and search results, we can identify relevant code spans in `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. In `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Derivative` class is defined, and its `__new__` method handles the creation of derivative objects. This method includes logic for differentiating with respect to `MatrixExpr`. However, there is no specific handling of the `kind` attribute within the `Derivative` class. In `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, both `MatrixExpr` and `MatrixSymbol` classes are defined. The `MatrixExpr` class includes an `_eval_derivative` method that returns a `ZeroMatrix` if the variable of differentiation is not contained within the matrix expression. The `MatrixSymbol` class inherits this method. These methods do not address the `kind` attribute directly. Therefore, the relevant code span is 'sympy/core/function.py' and specifically the 'Derivative.__new__' span where the derivative handling logic is implemented, as well as the '_eval_derivative' method in both 'MatrixExpr' and 'MatrixSymbol' classes in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py'.",
