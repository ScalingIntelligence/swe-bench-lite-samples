While the `kind` attribute for an integral of a matrix symbol returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, the derivative of the same matrix symbol returns `UndefinedKind`. This suggests a bug or an unimplemented feature in the `Derivative` class specifically related to matrices. To address this, a detailed look into the `_eval_derivative` methods and related properties in the `sympy/core` and `sympy/matrices` directories is necessary. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` and `Derivative` class implementations, along with any helper functions handling derivatives of matrix expressions, should be inspected.",

The example provided shows that `Integral(A, x)` correctly returns a `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, while `Derivative(A, x)` incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind`. To address this, we need to look at the code related to the `Derivative` class and its interaction with `MatrixSymbol`. In the provided search results, the `Derivative` class is defined in `sympy/core/function.py` with its `_eval_derivative` method, and the `MatrixSymbol` class is defined in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` with its own `_eval_derivative` method. Both classes have a `kind` attribute, which is correctly defined in `MatrixExpr` but does not appear to be handled in the `Derivative` class. This discrepancy suggests that the issue lies in how `Derivative` handles `MatrixSymbol` and its `kind` attribute. The `kind` attribute should likely be correctly propagated or initialized in the `Derivative` class when dealing with matrix expressions.",

From the provided context, we already have some relevant spans in `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. In the new search results, there are additional spans in `sympy/core/function.py` that touch upon the `Derivative` class, such as `Derivative.__new__`, `Derivative.canonical`, `Derivative._eval_derivative`, and others. These are relevant because they provide insight into how the `Derivative` object is created, how it handles substitution and differentiation, and how it interacts with other parts of the code. There are also spans in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` that are relevant, such as `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` and `MatrixSymbol.shape`, which provide context on how `MatrixSymbol` instances are differentiated and their shapes managed. Lastly, `sympy/matrices/expressions/applyfunc.py` contains `ElementwiseApplyFunction._eval_derivative` which may be tangential but provides insight into how element-wise functions are differentiated, which could be relevant for future extensions or similar functionality in matrix expressions.",

The issue is that while `Integral(A, x).kind` returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, `Derivative(A, x).kind` returns `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy needs to be addressed. From the initial context, it's evident that the `Derivative` class is in the `sympy/core/function.py` file, and the `MatrixSymbol` class is in the `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` file. The initial search results confirm that these files contain the relevant classes and methods. Specifically, the `Derivative.__new__` method is relevant for understanding how the `Derivative` class is instantiated, and `MatrixSymbol.kind` is relevant for the `kind` attribute in a matrix context. The search results also include other relevant methods such as `Derivative.canonical`, `Derivative._eval_derivative`, `Derivative.variables`, `Derivative.variable_count`, and `Derivative._eval_subs`, which are essential for understanding the current implementation and potential areas for modification.",
