The incorrect behavior is observed when creating a `Derivative` object for a `MatrixSymbol`. From the provided file contexts, it seems relevant to focus on the `Derivative` class definition and how it interacts with matrix expressions, particularly in `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. Additionally, the `MatrixKind` definition in `sympy/matrices/common.py` might also be relevant for understanding how the `kind` attribute should be set. Therefore, the search parameters should be tailored to look for the `Derivative` class and how it processes matrix variables.",

Specifically, the user provided an example where `Integral` correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` for a `MatrixSymbol`, but `Derivative` incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind`. I examined the <search_results> for relevant code spans. In `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, the `_eval_derivative` methods for `MatrixSymbol` and `MatrixElement` were found, which may be relevant for handling derivatives of matrix expressions. In `sympy/core/function.py`, the `Derivative` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `_eval_derivative`, and `canonical` are defined and might be the primary location to address the issue of incorrect `kind` attribute. There is also a reference to `Derivative` in `sympy/tensor/array/array_derivatives.py`, which extends `Derivative` for arrays, suggesting a potential link between matrix derivatives and array handling. Based on these findings, I conclude the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py` and the related methods in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` are relevant to address the reported issue.",

Currently, the `kind` attribute for `Derivative(MatrixSymbol, x)` returns `UndefinedKind`, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` similar to `Integral(MatrixSymbol, x)`. This suggests that the `Derivative` class or the `MatrixSymbol` class may need to be adjusted to handle the `kind` attribute correctly for matrix expressions.\n\nI began by examining the `Derivative` class and its methods, focusing on `__new__`, `canonical`, and `_eval_derivative`. These methods handle the creation, canonicalization, and evaluation of derivatives.\n\nNext, I looked at the `MatrixSymbol` class and its methods, especially `_eval_derivative`. The `MatrixSymbol` class currently returns a `ZeroMatrix` for derivatives, which does not affect the `kind` attribute directly but is related to matrix differentiation.\n\nIn the new search results, there are additional methods in the `Derivative` class that interact with matrix expressions, such as `_eval_subs`, `_eval_lseries`, `_eval_nseries`, and `_eval_as_leading_term`. These methods might be relevant for implementing or fixing the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` when the expression is a `MatrixSymbol`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are within the `Derivative` class and the `MatrixSymbol` class. The identified spans include methods that are crucial for the creation, manipulation, and evaluation of derivatives and matrix expressions.",
