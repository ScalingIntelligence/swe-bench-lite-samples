There seems to be a discrepancy in how the `kind` attribute is being handled for the `Derivative` of a `MatrixSymbol`. The `sympy/core/function.py` file contains the `Derivative` class, and the `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` file contains the `MatrixSymbol` class. Since the issue involves the interaction between these two classes, it's crucial to search for any methods or properties related to the `kind` attribute in both these files.",

This indicates a potential problem in the Derivative class's handling of MatrixSymbol objects. From the search results, the relevant code spans are those that define the Derivative class and its attributes or methods that are related to the 'kind' attribute or the handling of variables. Additionally, since the issue involves MatrixSymbol, relevant code spans from the matexpr.py file are also identified, focusing on the MatrixSymbol class and its interactions with Derivative. The identified spans include Derivative's constructor (__new__), its properties like variable_count, and free_symbols, which are potentially involved in determining the kind attribute. For MatrixSymbol, spans that define its properties and behavior are relevant, particularly those related to differentiation and shapes, which might influence the kind attribute.

Relevant code spans include the `__new__` method of `Derivative`, the `variable_count` property, and the `free_symbols` property. For `MatrixSymbol`, important spans are the `__new__` method, the `_eval_derivative` method, and the `free_symbols` property.

            "scratch_pad": "First, I analyzed the reported issue which highlighted a discrepancy in the 'kind' attribute for Derivative objects, particularly when differentiating a MatrixSymbol. The issue provides a comparison between Integral and Derivative operations on a MatrixSymbol, where the Integral correctly returns a MatrixKind(NumberKind), but the Derivative returns UndefinedKind. This points to the need to investigate the Derivative class and MatrixSymbol handling in the differentiation logic.\n\nThe file context and search results largely overlap, so I focused on reviewing the Derivative class and MatrixSymbol class found in 'sympy/core/function.py' and 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py'. In 'sympy/core/function.py', the Derivative class is detailed, particularly the __new__ method which handles the creation of derivative objects. Within this method, the logic for differentiating various types of expressions, including MatrixExpr, is described. However, there is no explicit handling of the 'kind' attribute in this section, and what is returned for MatrixSymbol derivatives isn't directly addressed.\n\nIn 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py', the MatrixSymbol class is defined with methods that pertain to its properties and operations, including the differentiation operation determined by _eval_derivative. This function returns a ZeroMatrix when differentiating a MatrixSymbol with respect to another variable, which is a relevant part of the codebase due to its connection to how MatrixSymbols are differentiated.\n\nThe search results and file context provided a clear view of how derivatives are processed in SymPy. The current handling of MatrixSymbol in differentiation suggests that there might be an omission or a specific design choice that has resulted in UndefinedKind as the output type for derivatives involving MatrixSymbols. The emphasis in the Derivative class on handling various expression types, but missing a direct implementation for addressing the 'kind' attribute's behavior when differentiating MatrixSymbols, indicates a potential area that requires attention.\n\nBy focusing on the Derivative and MatrixSymbol classes, particularly the methods for constructing and differentiating expressions, I identified code spans (particularly in 'sympy/core/function.py' and 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py', related to the Derivative and MatrixSymbol classes) that contain relevant logic for the reported issue. However, the absence of specific 'kind' attribute handling for MatrixSymbol in these methods suggests that addressing the issue might involve not just locating existing methods but also implementing additional functionality to specifically control the 'kind' attribute's behavior during differentiation.",
