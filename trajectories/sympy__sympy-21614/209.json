Specifically, the `kind` attribute for an `Integral` object is correctly identified as `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but for a `Derivative` object, it is incorrectly identified as `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy suggests an issue in the implementation of the `kind` attribute within the `Derivative` class or possibly in the interaction between the `Derivative` class and the `MatrixSymbol` class. Given the context provided, the focus should be on files where the `Derivative` class and its properties, particularly `kind`, are likely defined or interacted with. The search should narrow down to these specific files and potentially related ones to identify where the `kind` attribute is set or computed for derivatives involving matrix symbols.",

The issue suggests that while Integral correctly returns a MatrixKind, Derivative returns UndefinedKind for MatrixSymbol. This discrepancy implies that the logic for evaluating the 'kind' attribute in Derivative is either missing or incorrect for MatrixSymbol. In the provided search results, several relevant spans are highlighted:\n\n1. The imports and the definition of MatrixSymbol in 'matexpr.py' indicate a potential place where the 'kind' attribute should be handled for MatrixSymbol specifically.\n2. The method '_eval_derivative_matrix_lines' in MatrixSymbol, which is responsible for computing derivative lines, might contain the logic relevant to the 'kind' attribute.\n3. The Derivative class definition and the '__new__' method within 'function.py' define how Derivative objects are instantiated and might also potentially hold information about the 'kind' attribute behavior.\n4. Additional methods in Derivative such as 'canonical', 'free_symbols', and evaluation methods like '_eval_lseries' and '_eval_as_leading_term' might indirectly influence the 'kind' attribute, particularly if they handle types or classes differently.\n\nBy examining these code spans, I hope to identify where MatrixSymbol-specific logic for the 'kind' attribute is missing or needs adjustment.",

Specifically, the `kind` attribute for an `Integral` object is correctly identified as `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but for a `Derivative` object, it is incorrectly identified as `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy suggests an issue in the implementation of the `kind` attribute within the `Derivative` class or possibly in the interaction between the `Derivative` class and the `MatrixSymbol` class. Given the context provided, the focus should be on files where the `Derivative` class and its properties, particularly `kind`, are likely defined or interacted with. The search should narrow down to these specific files and potentially related ones to identify where the `kind` attribute is set or computed for derivatives involving matrix symbols. The provided file context includes `sympy/core/function.py`, which contains the definition of the `Derivative` class, and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, which contains the `MatrixSymbol` class.

It's crucial to find where and how the `kind` attribute of a `Derivative` object containing a `MatrixSymbol` is determined. This could involve looking into methods within the `Derivative` class related to variable handling and possibly examining methods in the `MatrixSymbol` class that could influence this attribute during the differentiation process.

This suggests that the `kind` attribute for MatrixSymbol derivatives is not correctly implemented. The provided search results and file context include sections related to the `MatrixSymbol` and `Derivative` classes, particularly focusing on derivative evaluation and attribute handling. Relevant code spans include the `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` and `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines` methods, and the `Derivative.__new__` method. These sections are crucial for understanding how derivatives are computed and how the kind attribute should be evaluated for MatrixSymbol instances.
