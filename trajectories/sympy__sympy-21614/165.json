The example shows that the `kind` attribute for an `Integral` of a matrix symbol is correctly identified as `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, whereas for a `Derivative`, it is incorrectly returning `UndefinedKind`. The search should focus on the `Derivative` class and related methods, particularly the `_eval_derivative` method and any property methods related to `kind`. Additionally, considering the involvement of matrix expressions, related classes and methods in the `sympy.matrices` module should also be examined.",

This suggests that the problem lies in the implementation of the `Derivative` class, particularly how it handles the `kind` attribute and its differentiation logic when dealing with matrix expressions. From the search results, the `Derivative` class spans several important methods such as `__new__`, `_eval_derivative`, `variables`, `variable_count`, and `_eval_subs`, which are all relevant to understanding how derivatives are created and managed. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class is also crucial as it represents the matrix in question, and understanding its properties and how it interacts with the `Derivative` class is key. The `MatrixExpr` class, which `MatrixSymbol` inherits from, is also important for understanding the matrix expression framework within which the `Derivative` works. Overall, these classes and methods form the backbone of the issue, and further investigation into how the `kind` attribute is determined in the `Derivative` class, and how matrix symbols are differentiated, is necessary to resolve the reported issue.",
