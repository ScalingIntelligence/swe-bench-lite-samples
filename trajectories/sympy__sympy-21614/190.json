The example provided shows that the `kind` attribute is correctly defined for an `Integral` but incorrectly defined as `UndefinedKind` for a `Derivative`. From the provided file context, it seems relevant to focus on files where the `Derivative` class or its methods such as `_eval_derivative` are defined, and also on the `MatrixSymbol` class and its related methods. I will search for these specific classes and related methods to identify the discrepancy in the `kind` attribute.",

The correct usage for `Integral` shows `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but the `Derivative` shows `UndefinedKind`. This suggests that the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` is not being set or returned correctly. Analysing the provided code snippets, the `Derivative` class lacks specific handling for the `kind` attribute. The `MatrixSymbol` class, however, has a `_diff_wrt` property set to `True`, which is used in the `Derivative` class to check if it can be differentiated. The `MatrixKind` class is defined to handle the kind of matrices, which should be used to set the `kind` attribute for derivatives of matrix expressions. The current issue might be due to either the absence of `kind` attribute handling in `Derivative`, or an issue in how `MatrixKind` is being applied during differentiation.",

The `Derivative` class has methods for handling differentiation, including `__new__`, `_eval_derivative`, and `doit`. However, the actual handling or assignment of the 'kind' attribute specifically in the context of `Derivative` objects involving `MatrixSymbol` is not directly visible from these methods. The `MatrixSymbol` class also has a method `_eval_derivative` which returns a `ZeroMatrix` for derivatives, but it doesn't directly show how the 'kind' attribute is affected. Given that the `MatrixKind` class is related to the 'kind' attribute for matrix-related expressions, it would be beneficial to search for its integration with the `Derivative` class or its methods.

The task is to identify the relevant code spans in the existing codebase to understand where and why this behavior occurs. Analysis of the provided code and search results indicates that the key sections to focus on are those related to the `Derivative` class and its interaction with `MatrixSymbol`. The `Derivative._eval_derivative` and `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` methods are particularly relevant, as they handle the differentiation logic. Additionally, understanding how the `kind` attribute is determined and why it might return `UndefinedKind` for certain cases is crucial. The search results confirm the presence of these methods and related logic in the `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` files. Further analysis within these spans will help in determining how to address the issue.",

However, the actual handling or assignment of the 'kind' attribute specifically in the context of `Derivative` objects involving `MatrixSymbol` is not directly visible from these methods. The `MatrixSymbol` class also has a method `_eval_derivative` which returns a `ZeroMatrix` for derivatives, but it doesn't directly show how the 'kind' attribute is affected. Given that the `MatrixKind` class is related to the 'kind' attribute for matrix-related expressions, it would be beneficial to search for its integration with the `Derivative` class or its methods.
