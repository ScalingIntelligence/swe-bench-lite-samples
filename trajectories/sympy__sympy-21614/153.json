Specifically, it seems that when a `Derivative` is taken of a `MatrixSymbol`, the `kind` attribute is returning `UndefinedKind` instead of the expected kind. To resolve this, we need to inspect the `Derivative` class and its related methods, especially the `MatrixSymbol` and `MatrixExpr` classes since the issue involves matrix differentiation. Additionally, understanding how the `kind` attribute is assigned and managed will be crucial. We should also consider looking at the `kind` handling in the context of matrix expressions.",
