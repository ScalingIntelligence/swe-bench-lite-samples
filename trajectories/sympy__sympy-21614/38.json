Specifically, it mentions that the `kind` attribute works correctly for `Integral` but incorrectly for `Derivative`. The issue points to the `Derivative` class in the `sympy/core/function.py` file as the source of the problem. The provided search results include several relevant spans from this file, particularly focusing on the `Derivative` class and its methods. Examining the `Derivative` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `canonical`, and `_sort_variable_count` reveals that there is an explicit handling of `Integral` and `MatrixSymbol` but not mention of `kind` attribute in the context of `Derivative`. This suggests that the `kind` attribute might not be explicitly defined or handled for `Derivative`. The search results also include the `MatrixSymbol` class from `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, which is referenced in the `Derivative` class. This class defines properties such as `shape`, `name`, and `_eval_derivative`, but again, there is no direct mention of the `kind` attribute. Therefore, it is determined that the relevant code spans are those within the `Derivative` class, specifically the `__new__` and `canonical` methods, which are most likely to interact with or influence the `kind` attribute.",

The issue states that while `Integral` returns a `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` for the `kind` attribute, `Derivative` returns `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the implementation of the `Derivative` class.\n\nThe current file context provided includes the `Derivative` class definition and its `__new__` method, which is central to creating a `Derivative` object. This method is responsible for handling the differentiation process and is likely where the fix should be applied.\n\nThe new search results provide additional context within the same file (`sympy/core/function.py`), including further methods of the `Derivative` class such as `canonical`, `_sort_variable_count`, and `_eval_is_commutative`. These methods are related to the internal workings of the `Derivative` class and could be relevant to the resolution of the issue, especially `_sort_variable_count` which is used in the `canonical` method to sort variables.\n\nIn the `sympy/core/kind.py` file, there is a definition of `UndefinedKind`, which is likely the value being returned incorrectly by the `Derivative` class. This indicates that the issue could involve properly setting or modifying the `kind` attribute within the `Derivative` class to return an appropriate kind for `MatrixSymbol`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are identified as those covering the `Derivative` class and its methods in `sympy/core/function.py`, particularly those related to handling and sorting variables, and the definition of `UndefinedKind` in `sympy/core/kind.py`.",

The correct behavior should return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but instead, it returns `UndefinedKind`. To address this issue, I reviewed the relevant parts of the code, focusing on the `Derivative` class and its interaction with `MatrixSymbol`. I examined the `Derivative.__new__` method, which handles the creation of a derivative, and the `MatrixSymbol` class, specifically the `_eval_derivative` method. However, the key issue seems to be in how the `kind` attribute is set or evaluated for derivatives, which was not explicitly found in the provided code spans. Since the issue points to a discrepancy in the `kind` attribute for derivatives involving matrices, it suggests that the problem might lie in how the `kind` attribute is determined or computed within the `Derivative` class, potentially in methods related to kind handling or class inheritance. Further investigation in the codebase, especially around class attributes and methods that handle kind determination, would be needed to fully resolve the issue.",
