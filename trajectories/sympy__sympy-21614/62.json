The problem is that the Derivative of a MatrixSymbol results in 'UndefinedKind', whereas an Integral returns 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)'. This suggests investigating the implementation and properties related to the Derivative class and its interactions with MatrixSymbol. Focus should be on the _eval_derivative and _eval_derivative_matrix_lines methods as these may influence the kind attribute's assignment for MatrixSymbol derivatives. Additionally, considering the MatrixKind class, which defines the kind for matrix expressions, might provide insight into how kind attributes are assigned and why Derivative might not be correctly assigning 'MatrixKind'.",
