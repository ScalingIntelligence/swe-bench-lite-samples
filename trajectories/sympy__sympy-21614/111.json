The correct 'kind' for an Integral object is displayed as 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)', but for a Derivative object, it shows 'UndefinedKind', which is incorrect. Two potential areas that may need checking are the implementation of the Derivative class and any associated methods or properties that handle the 'kind' attribute. Additionally, the MatrixSymbol class and its associated methods are also worth checking, as the derivative involves matrix operations. The search should focus on these classes and the specific method generating the 'kind' attribute for the Derivative object.",

The issue points out that while Integral correctly sets the 'kind' attribute for a MatrixSymbol to 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)', Derivative sets it to 'UndefinedKind'. This indicates that there might be an issue in how the Derivative class handles MatrixSymbol instances, particularly in setting or determining the 'kind' attribute. The search results reveal the relevant code spans within the Derivative class and MatrixSymbol class. The spans in Derivative include initialization (__new__), properties like expr, variables, variable_count, _wrt_variables, and methods like _sort_variable_count, _eval_is_commutative, _eval_subs, and _eval_as_leading_term. These spans likely contain the logic determining the kind attribute or manipulating the matrix or derivative objects. Meanwhile, the MatrixSymbol class spans include properties like shape, name, and methods like _entry, _eval_simplify, and _eval_derivative. This code helps in understanding how MatrixSymbols are created and handled within the context of derivatives.",
