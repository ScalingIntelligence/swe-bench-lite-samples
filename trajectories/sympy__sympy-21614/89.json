This discrepancy suggests that the problem lies within the Derivative class or its interaction with MatrixSymbol. Therefore, the search should focus on the Derivative class and its properties, particularly the `kind` attribute and methods dealing with matrix expressions. Also, considering files related to matrix expressions and derivatives of matrices would be beneficial.",

The correct behavior should result in `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, but currently, it outputs `UndefinedKind`. To address this, we need to review the code related to `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` to identify where the `kind` attribute is set or inferred incorrectly.\n\n1. In the `sympy/core/function.py`, we have the `Derivative` class with its `__new__` method handling the creation of derivative objects. It processes expressions and variables, but does not explicitly handle the `kind` attribute for matrix expressions.\n2. The `MatrixSymbol` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` does not directly set the `kind` attribute for derivatives in its `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` method.\n3. The `_derivative_dispatch` function in `sympy/core/function.py` is responsible for differentiating matrix expressions, but again, no explicit handling of `kind` is observed.\n4. The `MatrixKind` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py` defines the kind for matrix elements, which should be used in derivatives too. However, this hasn't been integrated into the derivative calculation.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the `kind` attribute is correctly set to `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` when differentiating a `MatrixSymbol`. This involves updating the `Derivative` class or its associated methods to recognize and set the appropriate `kind` for matrix derivatives.",

The issue shows that the `kind` attribute of an `Integral` applied to a `MatrixSymbol` yields 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)', which is correct. However, when the `Derivative` is applied to the same `MatrixSymbol`, the `kind` attribute yields 'UndefinedKind', which is incorrect. The task is to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the `Derivative` class and its interaction with matrix expressions, particularly the `MatrixSymbol`. The current context provided relevant spans from the `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` files, including the `Derivative` class and its methods, and the `MatrixSymbol` class and its methods. The new search results reaffirm the importance of these files and specifically the `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` classes, with additional spans such as `Derivative.canonical`, `Derivative._sort_variable_count`, and `Derivative._eval_is_commutative` in `sympy/core/function.py`, and the `MatrixSymbol.__new__`, `MatrixSymbol.shape`, and `MatrixSymbol.name` methods in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. These spans are crucial as they either directly involve the differentiation of matrix expressions or provide necessary context for how matrix expressions are handled in the codebase. The search results also include the `MatrixKind` class, which is relevant to the `kind` attribute that is the focus of the issue. It is clear that the identified spans from both the current context and the new search results are pertinent to addressing the reported issue.",
