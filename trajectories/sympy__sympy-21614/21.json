This discrepancy occurs when deriving a MatrixSymbol with respect to a variable. Relevant files that might contain the logic for handling the 'kind' attribute and the Derivative class include those related to matrix expressions and the core function class. Additionally, the MatrixKind class definition will likely be relevant for understanding how the 'kind' attribute is supposed to be set. To address this issue, search for the Derivative class and its handling of the 'kind' attribute, as well as the MatrixSymbol class and its derivative methods.",

The current example shows that `Integral(A, x).kind` returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` correctly, but `Derivative(A, x).kind` returns `UndefinedKind`, which is incorrect. This indicates a problem in the `Derivative` class when handling `MatrixSymbol` objects, specifically in the implementation or logic related to determining the `kind` attribute or handling different kinds of expressions. The relevant sections of the code to look at are within the `Derivative` class, particularly where `kind` attribute handling or differentiation logic with `MatrixSymbol` are implemented. I should inspect the `__new__`, `_eval_derivative`, and `doit` methods as they are crucial for understanding how the derivative is constructed and computed. Additionally, I should check properties like `_wrt_variables` to see if the differentiation variables are correctly handled for `MatrixSymbol`.",
