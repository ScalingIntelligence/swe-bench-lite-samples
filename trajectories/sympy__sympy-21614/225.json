The `Derivative.__new__` method handles the creation of derivatives and includes logic for differentiating matrices.

Specifically, the `kind` attribute for `Derivative(A, x)` returns `UndefinedKind` instead of a matrix kind. This suggests that the issue might be related to how `Derivative` handles matrix expressions. From the provided code spans, the most relevant sections are those handling the creation and evaluation of derivatives in `Derivative.__new__` and the properties of `MatrixSymbol` in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. Notably, `Derivative.__new__` contains logic for differentiating various types of expressions, including matrix expressions, which is a key area for identifying the issue. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class defines properties such as `_eval_derivative`, which might be relevant to how matrix symbols are handled during differentiation. Thus, these sections should be inspected for potential bugs or improvements related to the `kind` attribute assignment for matrix derivatives.",

But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nThe reported issue involves the `kind` attribute of `Derivative` and `Integral` objects in sympy, particularly when dealing with `MatrixSymbol`. The correct behavior for `Integral(A, x).kind` is `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, while the incorrect behavior for `Derivative(A, x).kind` is `UndefinedKind`. The issue suggests that there might be a problem in how `Derivative` handles `MatrixSymbol` objects. The provided search results include the `Derivative` class definition and related methods in the `sympy/core/function.py` file. These methods deal with the creation, evaluation, and internal representation of `Derivative` objects. However, there is no direct mention or handling of the `kind` attribute in the provided code spans within `Derivative`. Therefore, further investigation is needed to identify where the `kind` attribute is set or influenced in the `Derivative` class.",
