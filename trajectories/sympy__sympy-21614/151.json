This seems relevant because it handles the derivative operations and might be where the 'kind' attribute issue originates. Secondly, I looked for code related to the MatrixSymbol class since the issue involves differentiating a MatrixSymbol. I found the MatrixSymbol class and its _eval_derivative method in sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py. This is also relevant as it shows how derivatives involving matrices are handled.

The `MatrixSymbol` class does include methods related to differentiation, such as `_eval_derivative`, but there is no explicit handling of the kind attribute as it pertains to MatrixKind.
