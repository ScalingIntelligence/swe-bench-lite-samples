Particularly, `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative` returns `ZeroMatrix`, which is likely where the `kind` attribute issue originates.\n2. `sympy/core/function.py`: Contains the `Derivative` class with `_eval_derivative` method, which indicates how derivatives are evaluated.

This discrepancy is highlighted by comparing the `kind` attribute of `Integral` and `Derivative` over a MatrixSymbol. The search results provide valuable insights: 1. The `kind.py` file contains the definition of `UndefinedKind` and `Kind` classes, which are crucial for understanding the `kind` system. 2. The `add.py` file shows how the `kind` attribute is handled in the `Add` class, indicating that if there's a mismatch in `kind`, `UndefinedKind` is returned. 3. The `function.py` file has the `Derivative` class definition, which is directly related to the issue. 4. The `common.py` file defines `MatrixKind`, which is expected to be returned for the `Derivative` of a matrix.
