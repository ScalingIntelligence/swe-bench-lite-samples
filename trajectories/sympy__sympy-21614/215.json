The issue specifically points out that the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` returns `UndefinedKind`, which is incorrect as it should align with the `kind` attribute for `Integral` which correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. To address this, it's crucial to first identify the relevant code spans that deal with the `Derivative` class and its `kind` attribute. The search results contain the `Derivative` class definition and its method `_eval_derivative` within `sympy/core/function.py`. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class and its derivative-related methods are found in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. These classes and methods are likely places to start investigating and potentially modifying to correct the behavior of the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` when applied to a `MatrixSymbol`.",
