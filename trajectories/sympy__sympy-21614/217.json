The relevant code spans to identify include those that define or interact with the `Derivative` class, `MatrixSymbol`, and their respective `kind` attributes. Upon review, the code spans labeled 'Derivative' in sympy/core/function.py, 'MatrixSymbol' in sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py, and 'MatMul._eval_derivative_matrix_lines' in sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py are most relevant as they directly involve the `Derivative` class and matrix expressions.",
