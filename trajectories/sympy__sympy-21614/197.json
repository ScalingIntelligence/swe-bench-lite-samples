Initially, it might be useful to find the definition of the `kind` attribute within the `Derivative` class to see if specific conditions related to the `MatrixSymbol` and its integration might not be handled correctly. This involves searching through files related to `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` which handle derivatives and related computations, and potentially attributes or behaviors specific to matrix operations. Hence, I specify the search to look for `Derivative` and `kind` in files that also mention `MatrixSymbol`.",

This discrepancy suggests that there might be an issue in how the `Derivative` class is handling the `kind` attribute. The search results provide relevant code spans from `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` and `sympy/core/function.py`. The `MatrixSymbol` class from `matexpr.py` includes methods related to matrix derivatives, which might be relevant to solving the issue. Additionally, the `Derivative` class from `function.py` contains various methods and properties related to differentiation, including `_eval_derivative`, `expr`, `_wrt_variables`, `variables`, and `variable_count`. These sections are vital for understanding how the `kind` attribute is handled for `Derivative` objects. Thus, these sections are directly relevant to the reported issue.",
