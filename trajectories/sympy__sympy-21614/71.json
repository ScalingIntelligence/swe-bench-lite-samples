The issue specifically highlights that while the `Integral` of a `MatrixSymbol` returns a `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, the `Derivative` of the same `MatrixSymbol` returns an `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy indicates a possible bug in the `Derivative` class's handling of matrix symbols.\n\nTo address this, I reviewed both `sympy/core/function.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. The `Derivative` class in `function.py` contains methods and properties related to differentiation, including `__new__`, `doit`, `variables`, and `free_symbols`. These methods seem relevant as they handle the creation and computation of derivatives, which could be where the issue arises.\n\nAdditionally, the `MatrixSymbol` class in `matexpr.py` is inspected for its interaction with derivatives. This class includes properties like `shape`, `name`, and methods like `_eval_derivative` which are relevant to understanding how matrix symbols are handled in differentiation contexts.\n\nBased on this analysis, I've identified several code spans within the `Derivative` class that are likely relevant to the issue, including the constructor `__new__`, properties `variables`, `variable_count`, and methods `doit` and `_eval_is_commutative`. These sections directly deal with the creation and evaluation of derivatives and are thus crucial for diagnosing and potentially fixing the issue with the 'kind' attribute for matrix symbols.",

The provided context already includes relevant code from 'sympy/core/function.py' related to the Derivative class, where the __new__ method and properties like variable_count and variables are defined. New search results include additional files like 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' and 'sympy/matrices/common.py'. These files are relevant because they contain definitions for MatrixExpr, MatrixSymbol, and MatrixKind, which are directly linked to the issue. Notably, 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' includes the MatrixExpr class, which has a 'kind' attribute of type MatrixKind, and the MatrixSymbol class. This class is critical as the issue involves derivatives of MatrixSymbol. The '_eval_derivative' methods in both MatrixSymbol and MatrixElement are particularly relevant as they define how derivatives are handled. 'sympy/matrices/common.py' provides the definition of MatrixKind, which is the type of the 'kind' attribute mentioned in the issue. The definition of MatrixKind confirms its structure and element_kind, which is pertinent to understanding the issue. From the search results, it can be identified that the 'kind' attribute for a MatrixSymbol is expected to be an instance of MatrixKind. The issue arises when the 'kind' attribute of a Derivative of MatrixSymbol returns UndefinedKind instead of the expected MatrixKind. This might be due to the '_eval_derivative' method not correctly handling the kind attribute during differentiation. The current implementations of _eval_derivative for MatrixSymbol and MatrixElement do not account for the 'kind' attribute explicitly, which might be causing the issue.",

The issue states that while `Integral` correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` for a `MatrixSymbol`, `Derivative` returns `UndefinedKind`. To address this, we need to focus on the `Derivative` class and its related methods, particularly those dealing with kind attribution and differentiation with respect to matrix expressions. The provided search results offer valuable insights, including the `Derivative.__new__` method where the differentiation logic is initially processed, the `MatrixKind` class which defines the kind for matrix expressions, and the `MatrixSymbol` class which represents symbolic matrices and includes a method for evaluating derivatives. By examining these sections, we can pinpoint where the kind attribution might be going wrong and identify necessary changes or additions to correct the behavior.",
