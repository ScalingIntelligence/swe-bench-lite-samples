The problem arises because the `kind` attribute for a `Derivative` object returns 'UndefinedKind' instead of a more specific kind like 'NumberKind'. Given the context, the focus should be on the `Derivative` class and its interactions, particularly with matrix expressions. The relevant files and methods include those dealing with derivatives and matrix expressions, such as `_eval_derivative` and `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`. Additionally, the `MatrixKind` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py` is mentioned as having a structure to imitate for correct `kind` attributes. Thus, the search should center on these specific areas.",

To address this issue, we need to focus on the code related to the definition and behavior of `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol`. Specifically, we should look for methods and attributes within these classes that deal with the `kind` attribute and the differentiation process.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant files and spans include:\n1. `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` - This file contains the definition of `MatrixSymbol` and its derivative evaluation method (`_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`).\n2. `sympy/core/function.py` - This file contains the definition of `Derivative` and its methods for differentiation and evaluation (`_eval_derivative`, `doit`, etc.).\n3. Other files like `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py`, `sympy/matrices/expressions/applyfunc.py`, and `sympy/matrices/expressions/hadamard.py` also contain derivative evaluation methods (`_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`), which might be relevant if they intersect with `MatrixSymbol` or `Derivative`.\n\nGiven these observations, we should extract the relevant spans from `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` and `sympy/core/function.py` to get a comprehensive understanding of how `MatrixSymbol` and `Derivative` interact and how the `kind` attribute is affected by differentiation.",

The correct behavior should return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` for the derivative of a `MatrixSymbol`, but currently, it returns `UndefinedKind`. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the `kind` attribute and the differentiation of `MatrixSymbol`. From the provided search results, the following key areas are relevant:\n\n1. **sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py**:\n   - **MatrixSymbol** class: This class represents matrix symbols and is likely where the differentiation logic for matrices is defined. It includes the `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` method which is crucial for differentiation.\n   - **MatrixElement** class: This class represents elements of a matrix and includes the `_eval_derivative` method.\n\n2. **sympy/core/function.py**:\n   - **Derivative** class: This class handles differentiation in general and includes methods like `__new__`, `_eval_derivative`, and `canonical`.\n\n3. **sympy/matrices/common.py**:\n   - **MatrixKind** class: This class defines the `kind` attribute for matrices.\n\nThese classes and methods are central to the differentiation process and the handling of the `kind` attribute. By focusing on these areas, we can identify the specific code spans that need modification or inspection to resolve the issue with the `kind` attribute for derivatives of `MatrixSymbol` objects.\n\nGiven the provided search results and the context of the issue, the following code spans are identified as relevant to the reported issue:\n\n- From **sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py**:\n  - **MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines**\n  - **MatrixElement._eval_derivative**\n\n- From **sympy/core/function.py**:\n  - **Derivative.__new__**\n  - **Derivative._eval_derivative**\n\n- From **sympy/matrices/common.py**:\n  - **MatrixKind.__new__**\n\nThese spans are crucial for understanding and resolving the issue with the `kind` attribute for derivatives of `MatrixSymbol` objects.",

However, the `kind` attribute problem persists, as indicated by the issue description, where `Derivative(A, x).kind` incorrectly returns 'UndefinedKind'. This suggests a deeper investigation into how the `kind` attribute is determined within the `Derivative` class is necessary, particularly focusing on the matrix-related differentiation scenarios and how these intersect with the `MatrixKind` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py`. The context provided has methods like `_eval_derivative` and `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` which are key to understanding these intersections.

However, the `kind` attribute problem persists, as indicated by the issue description, where `Derivative(A, x).kind` incorrectly returns 'UndefinedKind'. This suggests a deeper investigation into how the `kind` attribute is determined within the `Derivative` class is necessary, particularly focusing on the matrix-related differentiation scenarios and how these intersect with the `MatrixKind` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py`. The context provided has methods like `_eval_derivative` and `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` which are key to understanding these intersections.
