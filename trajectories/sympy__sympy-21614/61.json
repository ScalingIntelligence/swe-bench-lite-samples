The problem is that while the `kind` attribute of an `Integral` correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`, the `kind` attribute of a `Derivative` incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy suggests an issue with how the `Derivative` class processes or sets its `kind` attribute. The focus should be on identifying where and how the `kind` attribute is determined for both `Derivative` and `Integral` instances, and then understanding why `Derivative` might be misattributing `UndefinedKind`. Some potentially relevant files and classes include `sympy/core/function.py` with the `Derivative` class, `sympy/matrices/common.py` with the `MatrixKind` class, and possibly other classes involved in attribute kind determination or matrix expressions handling.",

The search results include the `Derivative` class and its methods (`__new__`, `canonical`, `_sort_variable_count`, etc.) in `sympy/core/function.py`, which is the core logic for differentiation. Additionally, there's the `MatrixKind` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py`, which is relevant because the expected `kind` for matrices is `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. The `MatrixExpr` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` is also relevant as it deals with matrix expressions and their kinds. These code spans seem to be directly related to the issue of differentiating matrices and setting the correct kind attribute for the resulting derivative. The `Derivative.__new__` method is particularly important as it handles the creation of derivatives, including those of matrix expressions. The `MatrixKind` class and its associated methods provide the kind attribute for matrices. The `MatrixExpr` class handles matrix expressions and their kinds.",
