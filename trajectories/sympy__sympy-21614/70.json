            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the incorrect `kind` attribute for a `Derivative` object when differentiating a `MatrixSymbol`. The correct usage of `kind` attribute for `Integral` is given, while the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` is reported as `UndefinedKind`. This discrepancy suggests that the class `Derivative` in `sympy/core/function.py` may need adjustments to correctly handle the `kind` attribute for matrix symbols. Specifically, the `__new__` method in `Derivative` class currently handles the conversion and checks related to variables but does not explicitly handle matrix symbols or their kinds. Additionally, the `Derivative` class methods such as `_eval_is_commutative`, `expr`, `_wrt_variables`, `variables`, `variable_count`, `free_symbols`, `_eval_lseries`, and `_eval_as_leading_term` deal with various aspects of differentiation but do not address the kind attribute directly. Therefore, a relevant change would be required in `Derivative.__new__` or in its property methods to handle matrix symbols correctly.\n\nReviewing the `MatrixSymbol` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` also shows that it does not have a direct impact on the `kind` attribute of derivatives but is used to define matrix symbols which are differentiated in the reported issue. Hence, understanding the interplay between `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` specifically in handling the kind attribute for matrix types is crucial for addressing the reported issue. Since this is the first step in identifying relevant code spans, it is important to start with the `Derivative` class code in `sympy/core/function.py`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the following spans from the `Derivative` class are initially considered relevant as they directly pertain to creating new derivative objects and handling variables, which are key aspects of differentiating matrix symbols:\n1. `Derivative`, the class itself, indicating where the derivative operations are defined.\n2. `Derivative.__new__`, where the new derivative objects are instantiated, potentially including where matrix symbols could be differentiated or where the `kind` attribute might need to be set appropriately.\n3. `Derivative.expr`, a property that accesses the expression being differentiated, which is essential given that the expression contains matrix symbols.\n4. `Derivative._wrt_variables`, which tracks the variables with respect to which the differentiation is performed.\n5. `Derivative.variables`, which lists all variables used for differentiation.\n6. `Derivative.variable_count`, which could be relevant for matrix symbols as it keeps track of how many times each variable appears.",

The search results provide additional context, including the `MatrixSymbol` class and its method `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines`. This method is crucial for understanding how derivatives are handled for matrix expressions. Additionally, the `MatrixKind` class and its method `__new__` are relevant as they define the kind of matrix elements. The `HadamardProduct` class and its method `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` also provide insight into how derivatives are computed for matrix products, which could be relevant if the derivative involves such operations. Given the reported issue, the focus should be on identifying the code spans related to derivative computation for matrix symbols, particularly the handling of the `kind` attribute. Specifically, the `Derivative.__new__` method, `MatrixSymbol._eval_derivative_matrix_lines`, and `MatrixKind.__new__` are the key areas to examine for relevant code spans.",
