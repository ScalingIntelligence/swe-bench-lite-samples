We also need to examine the `MatrixSymbol` class and its interactions, especially how the 'kind' attribute might be influenced by the matrix operations and derivative calculations. Investigations should include '_eval_derivative', 'canonical', '_sort_variable_count', and 'doit_numerically' methods of `Derivative`, as they are key to understanding how derivatives are computed and potentially how the 'kind' attribute gets its value.

To address this, we need to examine the `Derivative` class and its methods, particularly those related to `kind` and matrix operations. From the provided context and search results, several code spans in `sympy/core/function.py` are relevant. These include methods like `__new__`, `canonical`, `_sort_variable_count`, `_eval_is_commutative`, and `_eval_derivative` in the `Derivative` class. Additionally, the `MatrixKind` class in `sympy/matrices/common.py` and its methods are examined, particularly `__new__` and `__repr__`, as `MatrixKind` should be returned when differentiating matrices. Furthermore, exploring other parts of the codebase, such as `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, which contains classes like `MatrixExpr`, `MatrixElement`, `MatrixSymbol`, and their respective methods, helps understand how matrix expressions and their types are handled, and ensures there are no additional areas that may impact this functionality. This comprehensive review should help identify the necessary code spans to rectify the described issue. The identified spans are:",

Additionally, the context should include the `MatrixKind` and `MatrixSymbol` definitions to comprehensively assess the issue. The search results include `MatrixKind`, `MatrixExpr`, `Derivative`, and their respective methods, particularly those managing attributes and operations on matrices, such as `__new__`, `canonical`, `_sort_variable_count`, `_eval_derivative`, and `kind`.
