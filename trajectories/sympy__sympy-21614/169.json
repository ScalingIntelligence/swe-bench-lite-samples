The attribute should return 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)' but is returning 'UndefinedKind' instead. This suggests a problem with how the `kind` attribute is defined or managed in the `Derivative` class when the expression involves matrices. The relevant file context points to several files where `Derivative` and matrix-related classes are defined, such as `sympy/core/function.py`, `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, and others. The search should focus on these files, particularly looking for methods or properties related to the `kind` attribute and how it might interact with matrix expressions.",

Meanwhile, the `MatrixSymbol` class in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' has a similar method `_eval_derivative` that is clearly matrix specific.

The correct behavior involves returning 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)' for Integrals but 'UndefinedKind' for Derivative. I will focus on the code spans related to the Derivative class and its interaction with MatrixSymbol objects. First, I reviewed the file context, which included the Derivative class definition and its methods such as _eval_derivative. Then, I analyzed the new search results, which again provided more of the Derivative class definition and its methods, including __new__ and canonical. The issue might be related to how these methods handle the differentiation of MatrixSymbol objects. There isn't any direct mention of 'kind' or 'MatrixKind' in these code spans, so I will focus on identifying the methods that handle differentiation and might interact with MatrixSymbol objects. Since the issue involves the derivative of a MatrixSymbol, I also reviewed the MatrixSymbol class and its _eval_derivative method in the new search results. However, none of the code spans directly address the 'kind' attribute or the correct handling of it when differentiating MatrixSymbol objects. Therefore, the search task is not complete, and I need further code or context to determine the exact cause of the issue with the 'kind' attribute.",
