The problem seems to occur when the `kind` attribute of a `Derivative` instance returns `UndefinedKind` instead of the expected `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. From the provided context, it's clear that the `Derivative` class and the `MatrixSymbol` class are involved. The focus should be on the `Derivative` class and its interaction with matrix expressions, particularly the `kind` attribute and its evaluation. Additionally, the presence of functions and methods like `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` in the context suggests that these might be relevant for handling derivatives of matrix expressions.",

The relevant code spans are those that involve the `Derivative` class and its interaction with `MatrixSymbol`. From the provided search results, several code spans related to `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` are identified. These include the definition of `Derivative` and its methods such as `__new__`, `_eval_derivative`, `expr`, `_wrt_variables`, `variables`, `variable_count`, `free_symbols`, and `_eval_subs`. Additionally, code spans related to `MatrixSymbol` are identified, including its definition and methods such as `__new__`, `shape`, `name`, `free_symbols`, and `_eval_derivative`. These code spans are likely to be relevant to the reported issue as they involve the core functionality of the `Derivative` class when applied to matrix expressions, which is the crux of the user's problem. By examining these code spans, it should be possible to understand how the `kind` attribute is determined and why it might be returning `UndefinedKind` in the specified scenario.",
