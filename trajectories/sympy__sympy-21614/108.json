The 'kind' attribute should be defined appropriately for both Integral and Derivative. Since the Integral object has the correct 'kind' attribute, the focus should be on the Derivative object and the classes/methods related to it. Specifically, the `_eval_derivative` methods in various classes and the Derivative class itself should be examined. Additionally, the `MatrixSymbol` and `MatrixExpression` classes could be relevant as they might affect how the Derivative object is instantiated and processed. The `MatrixCalculus` class and its methods like `diff`, `_eval_derivative`, and `integrate` should also be considered as they might involve the calculus operations that are integral to this issue. Furthermore, the `MatrixKind` class and its instances are directly related to the kind attribute of expressions in matrices.",

The correct behavior observed with the 'Integral' class and 'MatrixSymbol' is that the 'kind' attribute is 'MatrixKind(NumberKind)', while with the 'Derivative' class, it is 'UndefinedKind'. The analysis of the relevant code spans indicates that the 'Derivative' class is defined in 'sympy/core/function.py', and there's a specific method 'Derivative.__new__' that initializes the 'Derivative' object. The 'kind' attribute is not directly set in this method, which might explain the 'UndefinedKind' result. The 'MatrixSymbol' class in 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' does have a '_eval_derivative' method, but it returns a 'ZeroMatrix' for the derivative, which doesn't directly address the 'kind' attribute issue. Therefore, the relevant code span to focus on would be 'Derivative.__new__' in 'sympy/core/function.py' as it is responsible for initializing the 'Derivative' object and might need adjustment to correctly set the 'kind' attribute when dealing with 'MatrixSymbol'.",
