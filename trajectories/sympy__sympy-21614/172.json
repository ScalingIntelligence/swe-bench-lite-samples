Given this, the focus should be on identifying the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol`, as well as how `MatrixKind` is defined and applied.

These are relevant as they deal with the creation and properties of derivatives, which are key to solving the issue.\n\n2. `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` - This file contains the `MatrixSymbol` class and its methods such as `__new__`, `shape`, `name`, `_entry`, `free_symbols`, and `_eval_derivative`. These methods are relevant as they define the properties and behavior of `MatrixSymbol`, which is involved in the reported issue.\n\n3. `sympy/matrices/common.py` - This file contains the `MatrixKind` class which is directly related to the `kind` attribute involved in the issue. This class specifies the kind of elements within a matrix, which is crucial for understanding the mismatch between the expected and actual `kind` outputs.\n\nGiven these findings, the relevant code spans from the search results should be focused on the `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` classes, specifically their methods and properties related to differentiation, kind attributes, and matrix operations.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the `kind` attribute of the `Derivative` class when applied to a `MatrixSymbol`. The expected `kind` for an `Integral` of a `MatrixSymbol` is `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` but for a `Derivative`, it is `UndefinedKind`. This suggests that the `Derivative` class might not be handling `MatrixSymbol` correctly in its `derivative` computation or kind assignment. To address this, I need to identify relevant parts of the codebase that deal with the `Derivative` class and its interaction with `MatrixSymbol`, particularly where the `kind` attribute is determined or affected. From the provided code, the `sympy/core/function.py` file contains the `Derivative` class definition and its methods, including `__new__`, which is responsible for the creation of `Derivative` instances. This method involves differentiation logic and handling of different types of expressions, so it's highly relevant. The file also includes methods like `_eval_is_commutative`, `_sort_variable_count`, and property methods for handling derivative expressions, which could also be involved in the kind determination. Meanwhile, `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` contains the `MatrixSymbol` class definition, including its differentiation behavior. This interaction between `Derivative` and `MatrixSymbol` is crucial for understanding and resolving the issue with the `kind` attribute. Specifically, the `_eval_derivative` method in `MatrixSymbol` class and the differentiation handling in `Derivative` class will be the focus areas for identifying the relevant spans.",

These sections contain methods and properties related to differentiation, matrix expressions, and the kind attribute.
