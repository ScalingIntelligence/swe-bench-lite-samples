Specifically, these attribute names are being overescaped, resulting in unwanted backslashes in the generated HTML. To address this, it's necessary to locate where the escaping mechanism for attribute names is defined or applied in the Napoleon extension and Sphinx's autodoc extension. Potential locations include class definitions and methods within `sphinx.ext.napoleon` and `sphinx.ext.autodoc`. By focusing on the `_qualify_name` and `format_signature` methods in the Napoleon and autodoc modules respectively, we should be able to find the relevant code for the escaping behavior.",

Specifically, the attribute name 'hello_' is being rendered as 'hello\\_' in HTML, which includes an undesirable backslash. Upon examining the provided search results, the most relevant code spans are within the 'sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py' file. The 'GoogleDocstring' class and its methods are closely related to the handling and formatting of docstrings, which is central to this issue. Notably, the '_name_rgx' regex pattern in the 'GoogleDocstring' class is responsible for parsing names, including attributes, potentially influencing how underscores are treated. Additionally, the '_qualify_name' method handles the qualification of attribute names, which might also affect the rendering of trailing underscores. These parts of the code are directly involved in the processing of attribute names as described in the docstring, hence they are the most pertinent to addressing the reported bug.",

Specifically, the attribute name `hello_` shows up as `hello\\_` in the generated HTML. The issue is reproducible with a specific setup involving Sphinx version 3.0.4 and the extensions sphinx.ext.autodoc and sphinx.ext.napoleon. The expected behavior is the absence of the backslash in the rendered attribute name.\n\nTo address this, I need to identify the code spans in the search results that are relevant to handling attribute names and their rendering in the Napoleon extension. The focus should be on the `GoogleDocstring` class and related methods that process docstrings and attribute names. The spans involving `GoogleDocstring._qualify_name` and `GoogleDocstring._name_rgx` are particularly relevant, as they deal with the qualification of attribute names and the regular expression used for parsing them.\n\nGiven the previous context and the new search results, I will focus on these specific spans to ensure that they are correctly implementing the handling of attribute names to avoid overescaping.\n\nBased on the analysis of the search results and the reported issue, the identified spans are:\n- `GoogleDocstring._name_rgx`: This regex is used to parse attribute names, and any modifications to how it handles escaping characters could address the overescaping issue.\n- `GoogleDocstring._qualify_name`: This method qualifies attribute names and could potentially be involved in the rendering process where the overescaping occurs.",
