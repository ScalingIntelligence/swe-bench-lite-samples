Specifically, in class 'A' there is an attribute `hello_` which appears as `hello\\_` in the generated HTML. This problem seems to be related to the handling of attribute names by the Napoleon extension, particularly how it processes and represents attribute names in the documentation. Given that older versions of Sphinx (like 2.4.3) did not exhibit this behavior, it suggests a change in how attribute names are processed or represented in newer versions. To address this, we need to focus on the Napoleon extension's handling of attribute names, potentially within files related to docstring processing and HTML rendering.",

The constructor of `GoogleDocstring` (`__init__`) and the method `_qualify_name` are also relevant as they involve initialization and name handling, which might impact how attributes are processed and displayed.
