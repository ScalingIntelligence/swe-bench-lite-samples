The attribute 'hello_' is being overescaped and appearing as 'hello\\_' in the generated HTML, which introduces an unwanted visible backslash. To diagnose and address this issue, it's important to investigate how attribute names are processed and represented in HTML outputs, particularly focusing on the implementation of Napoleon's `GoogleDocstring` and `NumpyDocstring` classes, and the `esc` method in the EpubBuilder class since it also deals with escaping. It's also beneficial to review the patch or workaround functions like `_fix_field_desc` and `_qualify_name` within the Napoleon extension for potential modifications or corrections to handle trailing underscores appropriately.",

Specifically, the attribute `hello_` is being rendered with a visible backslash as `hello\\_` in the generated HTML. To address this issue, we need to identify relevant code spans within the Sphinx Napoleon extension that handle the formatting or escaping of attribute names. Given the search results, the `GoogleDocstring` class and its methods within `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py` are likely candidates because they deal with parsing and formatting docstrings, which includes handling attributes. The `GoogleDocstring._fix_field_desc` method is particularly relevant as it specifically deals with the description of fields, suggesting it might be involved in how attributes are rendered. The `GoogleDocstring._qualify_name` method is also relevant as it handles the qualification of attribute names, possibly affecting how they are displayed in the documentation. These methods should be examined in detail to understand how they process and format attribute names, including how they handle trailing underscores.",
