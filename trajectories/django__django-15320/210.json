This could be due to a missing or incorrect handling of brackets in the SQL generation logic. To pinpoint the exact cause and location of this bug, we should focus on the `Subquery` class and its methods, particularly `as_sql`. We should also consider the `Query` class methods since it interacts with `Subquery` and might affect the SQL generation process. The provided files and code snippets suggest that `django/db/models/expressions.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` are the most relevant ones to investigate. We will specifically look for the implementation of `Subquery.as_sql()` and related methods in these files.",

The provided search results include significant parts of the `Subquery` class definition in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, including the `__init__` method and the `as_sql` method. Additionally, there's relevant context in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` pertaining to the `Query` class, specifically the `__init__` method and the `as_sql` method. These sections are crucial as they directly involve the generation of SQL for subqueries. The identified code spans in the `Subquery` class are particularly relevant as they include both the constructor and the method responsible for SQL generation, which are central to fixing the reported issue. Similarly, the relevant spans in the `Query` class provide context for how the `subquery` attribute affects SQL generation. Thus, these spans are highly relevant to the task of fixing the SQL generation problem for subqueries.",
