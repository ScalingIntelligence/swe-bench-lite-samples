According to the report, the problem lies in the `Subquery` class's `as_sql` method, specifically the handling of the `subquery_sql` which is being sliced at the wrong places. The proposed solution involves setting the `subquery` attribute of the `Subquery` instance's query to `True` in the constructor to fix the issue. Upon analyzing the provided search results, most of the relevant code spans are found within the `Subquery` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, specifically the `__init__` and `as_sql` methods. The `__init__` method does not currently set the `subquery` attribute. The `as_sql` method is where the SQL string is incorrectly manipulated, leading to the reported problem. Without modification, the `as_sql` slicing operation incorrectly removes the first and last characters, which should either be corrected or the missing brackets should be correctly placed.",

Specifically, it removes the first and last characters instead of ensuring the subquery is properly enclosed in parentheses. The solution suggested is to set the attribute Subquery().query.subquery = True in the Subquery constructor to fix the problem.\n\nThe code spans provided in the search results show the implementation of the Subquery class and its as_sql method. Notably, the as_sql method currently slices the subquery SQL string with subquery_sql[1:-1], which explains the reported issue of removing the first and last characters. This behavior is incorrect and needs to be corrected to ensure proper SQL generation.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the provided code spans, the relevant code spans are the ones defining the Subquery class and its as_sql method. Specifically, the span_ids 'Subquery' and 'Subquery.as_sql' are identified as relevant because they contain the code that directly relates to the reported issue.

Adding Subquery().query.subquery = True attribute fixes the problem. From my point of view, it should be set in Subquery constructor.\nfrom django.db import connection\nfrom apps.models import App\nq = Subquery(App.objects.all())\nprint(str(q.query))\n# Output SQL is valid:\n# 'SELECT \"apps_app\".\"id\", \"apps_app\".\"name\" FROM \"apps_app\"'\nprint(q.as_sql(q.query.get_compiler('default'), connection))\n# Outptut SQL is invalid (no S letter at the beggining and \" symbol at the end):\n# ('(ELECT \"apps_app\".\"id\", \"apps_app\".\"name\" FROM \"apps_app)', ())\nq.query.subquery = True\nprint(q.as_sql(q.query.get_compiler('default'), connection))\n# Outputs correct result\n('(SELECT \"apps_app\".\"id\", \"apps_app\".\"name\" FROM \"apps_app\")', ())\n"
