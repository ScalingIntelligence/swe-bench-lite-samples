The problem arises because the method is incorrectly removing the first and last symbols of the SQL statement. To investigate this, we should focus on the methods and classes related to `Subquery` and `as_sql` across the Django ORM, focusing on the `django/db/models` directory where these are typically located. Pay special attention to the `Subquery` class and its `as_sql` method. It will also be helpful to explore interconnected classes and methods to understand how `Subquery` fits into broader query compilation processes.",

This issue can be resolved by setting the `Subquery().query.subquery = True` attribute. The search results provide relevant code spans that could potentially address this issue. Specifically, the `Subquery` class and its methods `__init__` and `as_sql` are directly related to the functionality described in the issue. In the `as_sql` method, the line `subquery_sql[1:-1]` is likely responsible for the invalid SQL, as it removes the first and last characters of the subquery SQL. Modifying this line or the initialization of `Subquery` to include the `subquery = True` attribute could resolve the problem. Thus, these code spans are relevant and should be considered for fixing the reported issue.",
