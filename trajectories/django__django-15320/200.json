The search results confirm the existence of the `Subquery` class with its `__init__` and `as_sql` methods. The `as_sql` method in the search results exactly captures the problem, where it manipulates the `subquery_sql` by slicing it from index 1 to -1, which is the cause of the invalid SQL generation. The relevance of the search results is high as they directly address the issue described.

The user suggests that setting `Subquery().query.subquery = True` in the `Subquery` constructor might fix this issue. Analyzing the provided code, the relevant spans are those related to the `Subquery` class and its `as_sql` method, as well as the `Query` class and its `as_sql` method since the bug affects the SQL generation process. The current `as_sql` method of `Subquery` is modifying the `subquery_sql` by slicing `[1:-1]`, which is likely causing the invalid SQL. Reviewing the `Query` class's `as_sql` method, it also checks `self.subquery` to determine if the SQL should be wrapped in parentheses, which matches the user's suggestion to set `subquery = True` in the constructor. Both these findings support the relevance of these code spans to address the reported issue. Additionally, the `Query.__init__` method's definition of `self.subquery` can be modified as per the user's suggestion to implement the fix.",
