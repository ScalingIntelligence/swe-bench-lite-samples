The problem seems to stem from the handling of the `Subquery` expression in the SQL generation process. The issue can be traced to the `Subquery` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, where the `as_sql` method is defined. Additionally, interactions with the `compiler` class and `connection` objects may be relevant, which are partially defined in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/backends/mysql/compiler.py`, among others. Therefore, focus should be on the `Subquery` class and its `as_sql` method to identify where and how the SQL string manipulation might be going wrong.",
