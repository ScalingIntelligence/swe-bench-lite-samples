The provided search results include relevant sections from django/db/models/expressions.py and django/db/models/sql/query.py that could be contributing to this issue. In django/db/models/expressions.py, the Subquery class and its as_sql method seem to be directly related to the reported issue. The method as_sql in the Subquery class contains the logic that constructs the SQL for the subquery, and it is here where the slicing of the subquery_sql (subquery_sql[1:-1]) could be causing the problem. Additionally, the init method of the Subquery class does not currently set the subquery attribute of the query to True, which the issue suggests should be done to fix the problem. In django/db/models/sql/query.py, the Query class and its init method are revealed, which includes the definition of the subquery attribute. This attribute is crucial as setting it to True appears to resolve the issue in the example provided in the reported issue. The context of the code indicates that the current behavior of the as_sql method in the Subquery class might need to be adjusted to avoid slicing the SQL string incorrectly. It also suggests that setting the subquery attribute in the Query class during the initialization of the Subquery might be a necessary change.",
