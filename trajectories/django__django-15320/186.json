Adding Subquery().query.subquery = True attribute fixes the problem. From my point of view, it should be set in Subquery constructor.\nfrom django.db import connection\nfrom apps.models import App\nq = Subquery(App.objects.all())\nprint(str(q.query))\n# Output SQL is valid:\n# 'SELECT \"apps_app\".\"id\", \"apps_app\".\"name\" FROM \"apps_app\"'\nprint(q.as_sql(q.query.get_compiler('default'), connection))\n# Outptut SQL is invalid (no S letter at the beggining and \" symbol at the end):\n# ('(ELECT \"apps_app\".\"id\", \"apps_app\".\"name\" FROM \"apps_app)', ())\nq.query.subquery = True\nprint(q.as_sql(q.query.get_compiler('default'), connection))\n# Outputs correct result\n('(SELECT \"apps_app\".\"id\", \"apps_app\".\"name\" FROM \"apps_app\")', ())\n"
