The problem can be fixed by setting the `Subquery().query.subquery = True` attribute, indicating that the issue might be in how the `Subquery` class handles SQL generation or how it is initialized. Reviewing the `Subquery` class and its methods, particularly `as_sql`, in files like django/db/models/expressions.py, django/db/models/sql/query.py, and others, is crucial. Additionally, the SQLCompiler class in django/db/models/sql/compiler.py is responsible for compiling SQL queries, making it a potential area to investigate.",

The issue suggests that setting `Subquery().query.subquery = True` fixes the problem, implying that the `Subquery` class might not be initializing or handling this attribute as expected. To address this, we should focus on modifying the `Subquery` class to ensure the `subquery` attribute is properly set and used within the `as_sql` method. Given the current code, the `Subquery` class does not explicitly set or handle a `subquery` attribute. Therefore, an update to set this attribute during initialization, or at least to ensure it's used correctly within `as_sql`, would be necessary to resolve the issue. The current implementation of `as_sql` is using a modified query (`query = query or self.query`) to generate SQL, but it doesn't seem to account for a boolean `subquery` attribute that affects SQL generation. Thus, a modification to the `Subquery` class's `__init__` method or the `as_sql` method is likely needed to correctly integrate and utilize the `subquery` attribute as described in the issue.",
