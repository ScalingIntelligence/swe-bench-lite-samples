The user suggests fixing this by setting `Subquery().query.subquery = True` in the Subquery constructor. I reviewed the current context and noticed the `Subquery` class definition and its `as_sql` method, which directly manipulates the SQL string causing the issue. I then analyzed the new search results, focusing on the `Subquery` class and its `__init__` and `as_sql` methods to check for possible solutions. The `Subquery.__init__` method does not currently set the `query.subquery` attribute, and the `as_sql` method handles the SQL generation, producing an invalid SQL string due to the slicing operation `subquery_sql[1:-1]`. This confirms the relevance of these code spans to the reported issue. Additionally, the `Exists` class, which extends `Subquery`, is also relevant as it might also be affected by the same issue.",
