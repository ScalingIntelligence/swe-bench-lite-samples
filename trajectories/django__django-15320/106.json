To address this, understanding the behavior of the `Subquery` class and its `as_sql` method is crucial. The relevant code spans in the provided search results specifically point to the `Subquery` class initialization and the `as_sql` method definition, which directly relate to the reported issue. Additionally, the initialization of the `Query` class and its `as_sql` method are examined as they are involved in the overall SQL generation process, especially in how the subquery attribute is handled. Reviewing the `SQLCompiler` class's `as_sql` method is also important for completeness, given its role in compiling SQL queries. The analysis indicates that the relevant sections of code involve the handling of subqueries, specifically in how they are initialized and how their SQL is generated, focusing on ensuring that brackets are correctly managed.",
