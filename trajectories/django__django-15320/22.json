This manipulation is incorrect as it removes the first and last characters instead of properly enclosing the subquery with parentheses. The solution suggested in the issue is to set the `subquery` attribute to `True` within the `Subquery` constructor. This confirms the relevance of the `Subquery.__init__`, `Subquery.as_sql`, and potentially the `Query.__init__` and `Query.as_sql` methods as they involve the `subquery` attribute and the SQL generation process.

Specifically, the `as_sql` method uses `subquery_sql[1:-1]` which could be causing the described problem of SQL being sliced incorrectly. Furthermore, the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` includes the `subquery` attribute that might affect the SQL generation. These findings align with the issue's description and suggest that the file context contains relevant parts of the codebase related to the issue. It appears that the core components affecting the SQL generation due to the `Subquery` handling have been identified within the provided file context.",
