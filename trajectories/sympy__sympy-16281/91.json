These spans include methods for importing necessary modules, initializing the PrettyPrinter class, and the core method `_print_Product` which specifically handles the pretty printing of products. This method contains the logic for constructing the pretty printed representation of products, including the use of Unicode characters and the stacking of elements.

Keeping everything below the horizontal line is good, but the bottom looks asymmetric, and it makes the \u220f bigger than it needs to be.\r\n\r\n- The \u220f is too fat IMO. \r\n\r\n- It might look better if we extended the top bar. I'm unsure about this. \r\n\r\nCompare this\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \u221e\r\n\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\r\n \u2502     \u2502  1\r\n \u2502     \u2502  \u2500\u2500\r\n \u2502     \u2502   2\r\n \u2502     \u2502  n\r\n  n = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's still almost twice as wide as the equivalent Sum, but if you make it much skinnier it starts to look bad.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \u221e\r\n ____\r\n \u2572\r\n  \u2572   1\r\n   \u2572  \u2500\u2500\r\n   \u2571   2\r\n  \u2571   n\r\n \u2571\r\n \u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\r\nn = 1\r\n```\n"
