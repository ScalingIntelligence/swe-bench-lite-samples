I'm starting my search by focusing on the 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' file, particularly the '_print_Product' method, as it directly deals with the pretty printing of the Product class. Additionally, I'm going to search for any file that might contain the 'Product' class definition, as this could offer insights into how the pretty printing aligns with the class's structure or attributes. Lastly, looking into 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_symbology.py' could offer clues about the underlying symbols used in pretty printing, which might help in tweaking the visual design.",
