The current formatting of the \u220f symbol and the associated layout can be improved by addressing the asymmetry at the bottom, reducing the size of the \u220f symbol, and potentially extending the top bar for aesthetic reasons. Relevant files and methods include `_print_Product` in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and potentially related methods in `sympy/printing/latex.py`, `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_symbology.py`, `sympy/concrete/products.py`, and `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py`. The search should focus on these files and methods to pinpoint the exact sections of code responsible for the pretty printing of the 'Product' class.",
