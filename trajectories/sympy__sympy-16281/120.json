The search results provided include the `_print_Product` method within the `PrettyPrinter` class, which is responsible for the pretty printing of `Product` objects. This method constructs the visual representation of the product symbol and its associated terms. It uses characters for horizontal and vertical lines, corners, and spaces to format the output, which directly relates to the issues mentioned in the report. The method also checks if unicode is being used and adjusts the characters accordingly, which may be relevant to the visual adjustments needed.
