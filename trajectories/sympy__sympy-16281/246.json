It uses `horizontal_chr`, `corner_chr`, and `vertical_chr` for constructing the product symbol's frame, and `sign_lines` is the list used for stacking these components vertically. The first step in addressing the issues would involve tweaking the selection of these characters to manage the 'fatness' and the bottom empty lines. For the 'fatness' issue, I would look into using thinner versions of the horizontal and vertical lines by adjusting `horizontal_chr` and `vertical_chr`. For eliminating bottom empty lines and improving symmetry, I would modify the construction of `sign_lines` to avoid adding unnecessary empty lines. Additionally, to explore extending the top bar, I would adjust the first element in `sign_lines` to be extended horizontally. Given the complexity involved in testing multi-step refinements, I would propose isolating and iteratively testing each modification within the method to ensure that aesthetic and functional improvements are effectively targeted.",

The relevant code spans in the search results directly relate to the pretty printing of the `Product` class, specifically the `_print_Product` method. This method contains the logic for creating the pretty representation of the product symbol. Additionally, the `PrettyPrinter` class initialization and other related methods are also relevant as they set up the printing environment and handle other aspects of pretty printing.

The method iterates over the limits of the product, constructing a visual framework that currently includes an empty line at the bottom. Adjustments to remove this line and refine the 'fatness' of the product symbol can be made by altering the selection of characters and possibly the logic for stacking components.
