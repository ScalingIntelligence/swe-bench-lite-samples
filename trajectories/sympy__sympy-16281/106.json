The current pretty printing has some visual issues, such as unnecessary empty lines and the symbol being too fat. The focus should be on the pretty printing functionality related to the `Product` class. Relevant files include those handling pretty printing and the `Product` class itself. Based on the provided context, the `pretty.py` file contains the `_print_Product` method, suggesting that this is the primary location to look for and modify the pretty printing logic for `Product`. Additionally, other files like `latex.py`, `pretty_symbology.py`, and `concrete/products.py` may also be relevant due to their connection to printing or the `Product` class.",
