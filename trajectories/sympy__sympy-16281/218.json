The feedback suggests that the current pretty print format for `Product` instances is too large and could be more aesthetically pleasing. There are specific criticisms regarding the presence of an empty line at the bottom, the width of the product symbol, and the possibility of extending the top bar for better alignment. The provided file context shows several files and methods that interact with the pretty print functionality, including `_print_Product` methods in `pretty.py` and `latex.py`. This suggests that the relevant code for addressing this issue is likely located within these methods or in the helper functions they utilize. Therefore, the search should focus on these methods and their associated code in the `pretty` and `latex` modules.",
