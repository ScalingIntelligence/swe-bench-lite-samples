This behavior is triggered by a redirection chain involving status codes like 303 and 307, where the method should change or remain consistent, respectively. To address this, we need to focus our search on files related to session management and redirection handling, particularly around the `SessionRedirectMixin` and `Session` classes in the `sessions.py` file, as well as the `resolve_redirects` method. Additionally, since the issue involves handling HTTP methods and redirection, we should also look into the `PreparedRequest` class and its `copy` method in `models.py`, as well as any related methods and classes in other files that could be affecting this behavior.",
