The problem occurs when the intermediate redirection uses a 303 status code that changes a POST request to a GET, and the subsequent 307 redirection should preserve the GET method but instead, it issues a POST due to the copied original request. Looking at the provided file context, the `resolve_redirects` method is located in the `requests/sessions.py` file, and it interacts with the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py`. Therefore, the search should focus on these files and related methods to identify the exact location where the original request is being copied.",

This function copies the original request at the start of each redirection loop, which is the behavior causing the issue. Additionally, the function contains logic to handle different HTTP status codes (like 303 See Other, 307 Temporary Redirect) and adjusts the request method accordingly, but it starts each iteration by copying the original request, which is why the method might not be preserved correctly in certain cases. Therefore, the identified code spans are directly related to the reported issue and should be considered relevant.",

These segments of code are directly related to handling redirects and preparing HTTP requests, which are central to the issue of incorrect method selection during redirection. The `resolve_redirects` method explicitly handles different HTTP status codes (like 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect) and adjusts the request method accordingly. The `PreparedRequest` class, particularly the `copy` method, is crucial for creating new request objects with the same initial settings, which can be relevant when dealing with redirection chains. Given this, it appears that the file context provided is sufficient to address the reported issue without needing additional files or methods. The relevant parts responsible for the handling of redirects and request method changes are clearly identified and included in the context.",
