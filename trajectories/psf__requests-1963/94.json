The primary concern is that when handling redirects, the method remains unchanged from the original request, leading to inappropriate HTTP method selection. For example, after a 303 See Other redirect, a POST should be converted to a GET, but subsequent 307 Temporary Redirects should preserve the GET. Reviewing the provided code span, it appears to be relevant to the issue as it contains the `resolve_redirects` method that handles redirection logic, including the copying of the original request. The code checks the status code and attempts to adjust the method accordingly, but still copies the original request at the beginning of each iteration, which could be the source of the problem mentioned in the issue. The identified code span seems to be directly dealing with the logic of handling HTTP redirects and would be essential for addressing the reported issue.",

The specific handling of 303 status codes (converting POST to GET) is present in the method, but the issue suggests that the handling of 307 status codes (preserving the current method) may not be functioning correctly because the original request's method is being copied each iteration. The method does attempt to adjust the method based on status codes, but the issue implies that this is not working as expected. The provided code closely matches the logic described in the issue, and while it does not directly solve the issue, it identifies the necessary code location that would need to be modified.
