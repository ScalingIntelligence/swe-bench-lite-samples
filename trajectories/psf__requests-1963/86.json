This behavior can lead to incorrect method selection, where the method of the request (e.g., POST) should be changed according to the 3xx status code encountered (e.g., 303 See Other converting POST to GET), but remains unchanged due to the copying of the original request. The focus should be on identifying where in the `requests/sessions.py` file the `resolve_redirects` method is defined and how it handles the copying of the original request object across different types of redirects.",

The provided search results contain the `Session.resolve_redirects` method implementation in the `requests/sessions.py` file. This method is responsible for handling HTTP redirection responses. The critical part of the code is where the original request is copied at the start of each iteration and where the HTTP method is reassigned based on the response status code. This directly addresses the issue described. Furthermore, other relevant sections include the `Session` class definition and its methods like `send`, `request`, and `prepare_request`, which are involved in sending requests and handling redirects. These sections are crucial for understanding how the redirection process is managed and how the original request might influence subsequent redirects. Thus, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",

The method copies the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) at the start of each iteration and then modifies the method type according to the HTTP status code encountered: if the status code is 303 See Other and the method is not HEAD, it changes the method to GET. This behavior aligns with the issue description, indicating that subsequent redirects should preserve the GET method but it fails because the original request object is being copied. This matching code directly addresses the reported issue. However, none of the contexts describe the case where a 307 Temporary Redirect would be handled differently or where the resolved URL is changed based on the new host. Thus, while the core issue of maintaining the method type during redirects is partially addressed, more context could be needed to fully understand this path in the code.",

The key point is how the method is adjusted during redirection handling, particularly when dealing with status codes like 303 and 307. The provided file context and search results include the `Session.resolve_redirects` method, which is central to the issue. This method handles the redirection logic and method adjustment based on response codes, specifically checking for 303 to change the method to GET. The search results confirm the existence of this method and show how it interacts with other components like `Session.send` and `Session.prepare_request`. The search results also include related methods like `Session.request`, `Session.get`, `Session.options`, and `Session.head`, which are important for understanding how requests are initiated and potentially redirected. The provided code spans are sufficient to diagnose and potentially fix the issue by adjusting how methods are chosen during redirection, ensuring that the method is preserved unless explicitly changed by a redirection status code like 303.",

The issue described is that `Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, which can lead to incorrect method selection during redirects. This is problematic because it does not respect the method changes mandated by certain HTTP status codes (e.g., 303 See Other converting a POST to a GET). The provided context and search results contain relevant sections of code that handle request preparation, redirection, and method adjustment. I've identified the critical function `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` which is responsible for handling redirection logic, including the copying of the original request and method adjustment based on the HTTP status code. The search results additionally include the `PreparedRequest` class which is relevant as it is used to create copies of requests during redirection handling. This indicates that further inspection of how `PreparedRequest.copy()` and `Session.prepare_request()` interact during redirects should address the reported issue.",
