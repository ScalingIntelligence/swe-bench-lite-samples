The search results from `requests/sessions.py` contain several key parts of the code that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` - This method is responsible for handling redirections and is where the issue likely resides. It copies the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) at the beginning of each iteration, which can lead to incorrect method handling.\n2. The logic within `resolve_redirects` that decides whether to change the request method based on the HTTP status code (e.g., converting POST to GET for 303 responses) does not seem to account for the fact that the request object is repeatedly copied from the original.\n3. The `Session.prepare_request` method and the `Session.request` method are also relevant as they are involved in the creation and sending of requests, which are components of the redirection handling.\n4. The `PreparedRequest.copy` method from `requests/models.py` is also relevant as it is used to create a copy of the request object during redirects.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified code spans in `requests/sessions.py` associated with `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`, `Session.prepare_request`, and `Session.request` are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue. The `PreparedRequest.copy` method in `requests/models.py` is also relevant as it contributes to the behavior of copying request objects during redirects.\n\nThe provided code spans should be sufficient to understand and potentially address the issue of method selection during redirects.",
