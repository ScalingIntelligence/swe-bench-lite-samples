Specifically, after a 303 redirect, where the method should change to GET, and then encountering a 307 redirect that should preserve the method, the original method (in this case POST) is erroneously preserved. In the provided search results, we find the implementation of the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class in `requests/sessions.py`. This method appears to copy the original request using `prepared_request = req.copy()` at the beginning of each redirection iteration. This is consistent with the issue reported, as it causes the method to not update correctly based on the redirection status codes. The method handling logic for different status codes like 303 is also present, suggesting that the observed behavior arises from always starting with the original request's method, rather than updating it based on the current redirect's requirements.",
