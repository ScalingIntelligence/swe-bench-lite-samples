The search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin` class which contains the `resolve_redirects` method. This method handles the redirection logic and is where the problem lies. It specifically copies the original request at the beginning of the while loop and then modifies the method based on the status code. This approach can lead to the incorrect preservation of the HTTP method across redirections. The relevant code spans from `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` to the end of the method definition are the key areas for addressing the reported issue.\n\nThere are a few steps that could be taken to address the issue:\n1. Instead of copying the original request at the start of each iteration, use the prepared request from the previous iteration.\n2. Update the method selection logic to correctly handle different redirection status codes such as 303, 307, and others.\n\nThese changes should be made within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, specifically in the `resolve_redirects` method.",
