This method is responsible for handling redirections and deciding the HTTP method for each step in the redirection chain. The method starts by copying the original request using `req.copy()`, which forms the core of the issue described. Additionally, the code includes conditions to change the method based on the response status code, but it does so by using the original request method, not the potentially modified one from the previous step.
