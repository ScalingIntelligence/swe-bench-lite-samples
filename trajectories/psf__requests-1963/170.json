The issue stems from the method's behavior of copying the original request for all subsequent request iterations during redirect resolution. This behavior causes the original request method to be used repeatedly, potentially leading to the incorrect method being used (e.g., POST instead of GET) as demonstrated in the provided redirection chain. Specifically, the issue occurring during a 303 See Other redirect followed by a 307 Temporary Redirect exemplifies this problem, where the original POST method persists instead of being converted to GET and then maintained as GET.\n\nIn the provided search results, we can observe the implementation of this method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, explicitly found under the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` span. The method copies the original request using `prepared_request = req.copy()` and then alters the method based on the redirect status code, which directly aligns with the described problem.\n\nThe provided code segmented into 'spans' allows me to associate the exact relevant sections of the code that directly address the issue.

However, the critical issue related to preserving the HTTP method for 307 status codes is not addressed. The current implementation does not handle 307 status codes explicitly to ensure the original method is preserved, which is the core requirement of the reported issue. To fully resolve this issue, additional code would be needed within the `resolve_redirects` method to handle the 307 status codes in a way that does not alter the HTTP method.",
