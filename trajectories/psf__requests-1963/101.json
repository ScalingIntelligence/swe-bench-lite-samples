This issue is directly related to how the method `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` handles the redirection process. The key part of the issue is that the method starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which can lead to inconsistencies, especially when handling different redirection status codes like 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect. This behavior is evident in the provided code span where the method `resolve_redirects` initializes `prepared_request` by copying the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`). This method then modifies the request based on the status code, but since it starts with a copy of the original, it can incorrectly select the method (like changing a POST to a GET and then not preserving the GET). This will result in incorrect subsequent method selections, especially for deeper redirection chains as described in the issue. Other parts of the code are related to the handling of cookies, headers, and authentication, which are also relevant as they are affected by the method selection during redirects. Therefore, the identified code spans from the `SessionRedirectMixin` are directly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

The current file context already highlights the problematic section of the code within `resolve_redirects`. The search results provided further contextualize the `Session` class and its methods, which call `resolve_redirects` and handle HTTP methods and redirects. These additional methods (`prepare_request`, `request`, `get`, etc.) show the flow of request processing in the `Session` class. However, the actual issue and a potential solution still need to be addressed within the `resolve_redirects` method. The relevance of other code spans provided in the search results, such as those in `api.py`, `cookies.py`, and others, doesn't directly address the core problem described in the issue, which concerns the handling of redirect status codes within the `resolve_redirects` function.",
