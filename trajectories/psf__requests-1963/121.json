Specifically, the issue points out that the original request object is copied for each subsequent request, which can lead to an incorrect method being selected during redirects.\n\nReviewing the current file context shows that no relevant code has been identified yet. The new search results encompass two files: `requests/sessions.py` and `requests/models.py`.\n\nIn `requests/sessions.py`, the relevant code span is found within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, specifically the `resolve_redirects` method. This method handles redirection logic and directly relates to the problem described in the issue. The method copies the original request object and adjusts the method based on the status code, but it lacks specific logic to preserve the correct method through subsequent redirections.\n\nIn `requests/models.py`, the relevant code spans include the `PreparedRequest` class and its methods (`__init__`, `prepare`, `copy`, `prepare_method`, etc.). These are important as they handle the preparation and copying of request objects, which are central to the redirection handling in `Session.resolve_redirects`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they directly involve the request handling and redirection mechanics. Adjustments in these parts of the code will likely address the problem of incorrect method selection during redirects.",
