The provided search results include the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class in the `requests/sessions.py` file. This method is responsible for handling the redirection logic and indeed starts each iteration by copying the original request object. This behavior is directly related to the issue described. Specifically, the lines where the method copies the original request object (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) and the subsequent redirection logic are relevant to the reported issue. This matches the issue where a 307 redirect should preserve the method but ends up using the original request's method due to copying. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue.",
