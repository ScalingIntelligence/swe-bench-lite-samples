This behavior is problematic, especially when dealing with status codes like 303 and 307. To address this, we need to find where `Session.resolve_redirects` is implemented to check if the original request method is being used instead of the corrected method after a redirection. Focus should be on `Session`, `SessionRedirectMixin`, and related classes. The search should pinpoint where the request method is being assigned or copied.",
