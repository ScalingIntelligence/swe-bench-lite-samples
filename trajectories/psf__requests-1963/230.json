This can result in an incorrect method being selected, as observed in the example where a GET method should be preserved after a 307 redirect but a POST is issued instead. The provided search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin` class containing the `resolve_redirects` method. This method initially copies the original request using `prepared_request = req.copy()`, which is the root cause of the issue. The method selectively changes the `method` attribute based on the status codes, but the original request copy logic seems to override these changes. Additionally, there is a `Session` class that inherits from `SessionRedirectMixin`, initializing various session attributes, including `max_redirects`, which is used to limit the number of redirections to prevent infinite loops.",
