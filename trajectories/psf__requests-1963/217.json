This method is responsible for handling redirects. The issue raised seems to be directly linked to the behavior of this method, which copies the original request at the start of each iteration, potentially leading to the original request method being used incorrectly during subsequent redirects.\n\nThe method checks the status code and attempts to adjust the request method accordingly. For example, it changes the method to 'GET' if the status code is 303 See Other. However, the original issue suggests that despite these attempts, the method can still incorrectly use the original request method. This discrepancy is central to the issue reported.\n\nGiven the detailed analysis of the reported issue and the examination of the `resolve_redirects` method, it is clear that the identified code span is relevant to the issue. Therefore, the search task is complete with the identification of this specific code span.",
