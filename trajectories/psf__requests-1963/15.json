Specifically, when following a 303 See Other redirection, the method should change to GET, but subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET method. However, the current implementation starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which incorrectly results in a POST request.\n\nTo address this, I need to search for the `resolve_redirects` method within the `Session` class, focusing on how it handles request copying and method selection during redirection chains.",

Upon analyzing the provided search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are within the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method. This method handles redirection logic and copies the original request object at the start of each redirection loop, which matches the issue description. Notably, the method contains logic to change the request method based on the redirection status code, such as converting POST to GET for status codes like 303. However, it appears not to handle preserving the method correctly for subsequent redirections, especially when dealing with chained redirections as described in the issue. This indicates a potential bug in the method's handling of the method preservation during redirects. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to fixing the reported issue.",
