The issue describes a scenario where an initial POST request is converted to a GET due to a 303 redirect, but subsequent redirects (like 307) should preserve the method. However, because `resolve_redirects` copies the original request for each iteration, it results in incorrect method selection (POST instead of GET). The search results contain the relevant code spans in the `requests/sessions.py` and `requests/models.py` files. In `requests/sessions.py`, the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method is responsible for handling redirection. The method starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which leads to the issue described. Additionally, the `Session` class inherits from `SessionRedirectMixin`. In `requests/models.py`, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method is responsible for creating a copy of the request object, which is used in the `resolve_redirects` method. These code spans are directly related to the handling of requests and redirects, aligning with the reported issue.",

This will involve removing the line `prepared_request = req.copy()` and instead building the `prepared_request` based on the current state, ensuring that method changes (like from POST to GET due to a 303 response) are correctly applied and not reverted.\n\nThe requirement is to update the `resolve_redirects` method to ensure that the `prepared_request` reflects the current method after handling each redirect response. This involves removing the initial `prepared_request = req.copy()` line and setting up the `prepared_request` based on the method determined after checking the status code. This covers lines from where `prepared_request` is initially set until just before it's sent again.",
