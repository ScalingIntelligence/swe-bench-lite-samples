            "scratch_pad": "Upon analyzing the reported issue, it's clear that the main concern is with the handling of HTTP redirections in the `Session.resolve_redirects` method. The issue describes how the method copies the original request for all subsequent requests, which can lead to incorrect method selection during redirection chains. For instance, after a 303 See Other response, the method should change the request to GET, but subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET method. However, because the method copies the original request, it inadvertently reverts to the original POST method. \n\nReviewing the search results, the key parts of the code that are relevant to this issue are found in the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method and the `PreparedRequest` class. Specifically, the `resolve_redirects` method contains the logic for handling redirects and copying the original request, which is where the problem lies. The `PreparedRequest.copy` method is also relevant as it is used to create a copy of the original request. \n\nAdditionally, the `Session.prepare_request` method is noteworthy as it prepares the request by merging settings from the session and the request itself, which includes handling cookies and authentication headers. This method ensures that the correct settings are applied to each request, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the request during redirection. \n\nGiven these insights, the most relevant code spans are those that directly address the handling of redirections and the copying of requests in the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method and the `PreparedRequest.copy` method.",
