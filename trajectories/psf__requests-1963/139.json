The provided search results contain multiple spans of code specific to the `Session` class and its methods, including `resolve_redirects`. This method is particularly relevant as it directly deals with redirect handling and the copying of the original request object. By examining this method, we can see how the original request is copied and how the method selection (HTTP method) is adjusted based on the HTTP status code of the redirection response. Given the nature of the issue, focusing on the `resolve_redirects` method is crucial for understanding and possibly correcting the redirection behavior. The code provided adequately addresses the issue by laying out the logic for handling redirects, including the conditions for changing the HTTP method based on the redirection status code. Since the method in question is fully represented in the provided spans, it appears to cover the necessary context to address the issue.",
