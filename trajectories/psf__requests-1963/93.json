This can be due to the method starting each iteration by copying the original request object. To address this, we need to focus on the `Session` class and its method `resolve_redirects` within the `requests/sessions.py` file. Additionally, it might be beneficial to look into the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py` to understand how the request object is being prepared and copied. Also, considering the involvement of redirection handling, files pertaining to connection pool management and HTTP adapters should be examined.",

While analyzing the provided search results, the focus is on the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method. This method contains the logic for handling redirects and is where the copying of the original request occurs. The issue describes how this behavior causes problems when a 303 See Other status code changes the method to GET, followed by a 307 Temporary Redirect, which should preserve the GET but instead reverts to the original POST method due to copying from the original request. This problematic behavior is exhibited in the <span id='SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects'> code span. Additionally, the <span id='Session'> code span and its initialization are relevant as it inherits from `SessionRedirectMixin`. The `requests/models.py` file is also relevant as it contains the `PreparedRequest` class, particularly the `copy` method, which is the basis for the request duplication causing the issue. Lastly, understanding the `requests/adapters.py` file, specifically the `HTTPAdapter` class, provides context for the broader architecture and how the request and redirection handling integrate across different components of the library.",
