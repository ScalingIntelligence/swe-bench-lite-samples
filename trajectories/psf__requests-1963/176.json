This behavior is demonstrated in the provided redirection chain where a POST request is mistakenly converted to a GET and then preserved as a GET instead of being changed back to a POST during the redirection process. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans where the redirection logic is handled. The `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method is responsible for handling redirection and is the main focus of our search. We find that this method indeed copies the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) for each redirection iteration, causing the original method to be preserved instead of adapting to the changes dictated by the redirection status codes. This confirms that the identified code span is relevant to the reported issue.",
