This behavior is clearly described in the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method. The method starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which can lead to incorrect method selection, as mentioned in the issue. Specifically, the method copies the original request object with `prepared_request = req.copy()`, and then determines the method based on the status code. However, due to the copying of the original request each time, it doesn't always correctly preserve the method across redirections, as seen in the handling of 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect status codes. This method is identified as highly relevant to the reported issue.",
