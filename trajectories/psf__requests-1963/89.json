The fact that the original request object is copied for each iteration of redirection might cause it to incorrectly issue a POST method even after a 303 status code has changed it to a GET. To address this, we need to search for the implementation of `Session.resolve_redirects` as well as any related methods in the Session class and possibly its mixin classes. Additionally, looking into the `PreparedRequest` class and its copy method might help understand how the request objects are being handled during redirections.",

The search results provide several relevant code spans that address this issue. First, the `Session` class initialization sets up parameters like `max_redirects` and mounts adapters for handling HTTPS and HTTP requests. The `prepare_request` method prepares a request by merging cookies and setting up authentication. The core functionality of redirection handling is in the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method, which iterates through redirects, copying the original request at each step and updating the URL based on redirection headers. This method raises a `TooManyRedirects` exception if the number of redirects exceeds the limit. The `Request` and `PreparedRequest` classes are also relevant, particularly the `copy` method of `PreparedRequest`, which is used to create a new instance based on the current request in the redirection process. These code spans collectively provide the necessary context and implementation details to understand and address the issue of incorrect method selection during redirects. Additional review of how cookies, auth, and other settings are managed across requests would provide further clarity, though the current search results cover the main aspects of the issue.",
