This specific behavior is evident in the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method where `prepared_request = req.copy()` is used to start each redirection cycle with a copy of the original request. This method does conditionally adjust the HTTP method based on the status code, but the problem arises because it always starts with the original request's method, which can lead to incorrect method selection. A key code span to look at is `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` where the redirection logic resides. Another important span is `PreparedRequest.copy` which ensures that each iteration of the redirection starts with a new copy of the original request, potentially carrying over the incorrect method from the original request. These code spans directly address the issue by showing how the method selection is affected by the copying of the original request.",
