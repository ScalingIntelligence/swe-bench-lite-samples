Upon reviewing the provided search results, it's clear that the code span labeled 'SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects' directly addresses this concern. This method handles redirection logic and initializes a new `prepared_request` by copying the original `req` (request) at the beginning of each loop iteration. This copying operation is precisely what the issue observes as problematic because it retains the original request method, potentially overriding HTTP method changes mandated by the redirection status codes. The relevance of this code span is further underscored by its handling of different HTTP status codes that mandate method changes, such as converting POST to GET for status codes like 303 See Other. Given this direct relevance, I've identified the 'SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects' span as highly relevant to the reported issue.",
