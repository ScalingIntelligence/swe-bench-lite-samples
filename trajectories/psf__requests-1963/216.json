Upon examining the provided search results, I identified the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. This method is responsible for handling redirects, and it starts each iteration by copying the original request object using `prepared_request = req.copy()`. This behavior aligns with the issue described, as it leads to retaining the original request method across redirects, which can cause incorrect method selection. Specifically, the problem might manifest when a POST request is expected to be converted to a GET after a 303 status code but remains a POST due to the copying of the original request. The code spans within the `resolve_redirects` method need to be reviewed and possibly adjusted to better handle method transitions according to HTTP redirection rules.",
