The relevant code spans highlighted in the search results relate directly to this issue. In `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`, the method starts each iteration by copying the original request object using `req.copy()`, which can lead to preserving the original request method throughout the redirection process. Specifically, the conditions that change the method to GET for certain status codes like 303, 302, and 301 are present but are not sufficient to prevent the original method from being reset in subsequent redirections if they start by copying the original request. Also, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method is crucial as it is used to create a copy of the original request, which impacts how the method is preserved during redirections. These code spans are directly relevant to the issue described since they involve the logic for handling redirections and copying requests, which are the focus of the reported problem.",
