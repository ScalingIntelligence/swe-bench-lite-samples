This behavior is explicitly mentioned in the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method. The method starts by copying the original request object at each iteration, which is potentially problematic. Additionally, the method is responsible for handling different HTTP status codes and adjusting the request method accordingly. However, the issue lies in the persistence of the original request method rather than updating it based on the redirection status code. Other relevant code spans include the `Session` class definition, which inherits from `SessionRedirectMixin`, and the `request` method within the `Session` class, as it is the main entry point for making HTTP requests and utilizes the `resolve_redirects` method.",
