The provided context indicates that the relevant files to investigate are `requests/sessions.py`, `requests/models.py`, and potentially `requests/adapters.py` since they contain the classes and methods involved in handling sessions, requests, and redirects. The specific method to focus on is `Session.resolve_redirects`, and it's important to check how the original request object is being handled and copied in this process. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py` might also be relevant due to its involvement in preparing requests. The goal is to identify the code segments where the original request object is being copied and then modified during redirects to ensure the correct method is preserved.",

By analyzing the provided search results, I identified several relevant code spans. First, the method `resolve_redirects` in `SessionRedirectMixin` directly handles the redirection logic. The code snippet involves copying the original request, changing the request's URL, and updating the method based on the redirection status code. This is closely related to the issue because it demonstrates the logic affecting the method selection during redirects. Additionally, the `Session` class inherits from `SessionRedirectMixin`, indicating that the functionality is a part of the Session's redirect behavior. The `PreparedRequest.copy` method is also relevant as it supports the creation of a new `PreparedRequest` object that is a copy of the original, which aligns with the copying behavior observed in `resolve_redirects`. Lastly, the `send` method in `Session` uses `resolve_redirects`, further confirming the integration of the redirection handling within the session. All these findings support the relevance to the reported issue.",
