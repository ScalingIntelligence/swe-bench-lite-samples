The provided search results contain a detailed implementation of the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. This method handles redirection logic and copies the original request object at the start of each iteration. This aligns with the issue reported, as the method repeatedly uses the original request method, which does not account for the changes required by certain HTTP status codes like 303 See Other. Specifically, the method changes the request method to 'GET' based on certain status codes, but because it always starts with a copy of the original request, this change is not preserved for subsequent redirections. Thus, the code spans within the `resolve_redirects` method are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
