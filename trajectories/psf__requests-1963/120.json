Analyzing the provided `requests/sessions.py` code, we find a section implementing `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`. This method is responsible for handling redirects and is part of the `Session` class. The issue mentioned directly correlates with the logic inside this method, particularly where it copies the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) at the start of each redirect loop iteration. This behavior does not account for the HTTP status codes (like 303, 307, etc.) that dictate how the method should change. This oversight is likely the root cause of the reported problem. Based on the issue description and matching it with the relevant code in the search results, it is clear that the identified code span inside `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` is directly related to the reported issue. It is essential to modify this method to properly adjust the HTTP method based on the redirect status codes, which is currently handled but fails to consider the original request's method across multiple redirects.",
