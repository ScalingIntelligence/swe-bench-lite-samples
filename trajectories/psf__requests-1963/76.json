The core problem lies in the copying of the original request object for all subsequent requests, which does not update the method after certain redirection status codes like 303 (See Other), causing the method to mismatch. To resolve this, we need to focus on the `resolve_redirects` method in the `requests/sessions.py` file and potentially related methods in the `requests/models.py` file, especially around the `PreparedRequest` class and its `copy` method.",

It specifically points out that the current implementation copies the original request for each redirection, which can lead to incorrect method selection (e.g., a POST request being wrongly converted to GET and then back to POST). The current context does not have any relevant code identified yet, so the analysis of the provided search results is crucial. The search results include significant code spans from `requests/sessions.py` and `requests/models.py`. The relevant code spans are mostly within the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method and the `PreparedRequest` class, particularly the `copy` method. `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` contains the logic for handling redirects, including copying the original request and modifying the method type based on the response status. The `PreparedRequest`'s `copy` method is used to create a copy of the original request for each redirection, and changes to this method could address the issue of incorrect method selection during redirects. Therefore, these code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and should be considered for further investigation or modification to fix the issue.",
