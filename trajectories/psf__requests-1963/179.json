To address this, I need to identify the relevant code span that handles the redirection logic. The search results provide several key spans that might address the issue.\n\n1. **SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects**: This method is directly responsible for handling redirects and includes the logic for copying the original request and modifying it based on the redirect status code. This is the most relevant span.\n\n2. **Session.prepare_request**: This method is involved in preparing the request before sending, which is also crucial for understanding how requests are handled during redirects.\n\n3. **Session.send**: This method actually sends the prepared request. It integrates with the redirect handling logic and is a vital part of understanding how requests are managed within the system.\n\nConsidering these spans, the main logic that needs modification to fix the issue with method selection during redirects is located within `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`.\n\nConsidering these spans are part of the process of handling and resolving redirects, they are relevant to the issue description and cover the main functionality required for fixing the conflict with redirection status codes and method handling.",
