Therefore, the focus should be on the `resolve_redirects` method in the `Session` class in `sessions.py` to ensure it properly handles method updates based on redirection responses.",

After analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method is the central piece of code handling the redirection logic. The method contains the logic for handling different HTTP status codes that trigger redirects, including the conversion of methods as per HTTP standards. The critical section is where the original request is copied at the beginning of each redirect loop (`prepared_request = req.copy()`), which is likely where the issue arises. Additionally, the method conditions for modifying the request method based on the status codes suggest a potential place for the issue. Therefore, the `resolve_redirects` method and its context are highly relevant to the reported issue.",
