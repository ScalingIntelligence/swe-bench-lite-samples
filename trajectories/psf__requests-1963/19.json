The primary focus should be on the `Session` class and the `resolve_redirects` method within the `sessions.py` file. Additionally, related methods and classes such as `PreparedRequest` in `models.py` and potentially `HTTPAdapter` in `adapters.py` should be examined to ensure comprehensive understanding of how request methods are managed across redirection scenarios.",

The analysis of the provided code reveals that the relevant code spans are located within the SessionRedirectMixin class in sessions.py, specifically the resolve_redirects method. This method handles the logic for resolving redirects and the handling of request method changes based on the redirection status codes. The primary issue mentioned involves copying the original request object at each iteration, which does not change the method according to the redirection rules (e.g., converting POST to GET on status code 303). The PreparedRequest.copy method in models.py is also relevant as it demonstrates how a request is copied, which is fundamental to understanding the process in which the method is (not) being updated. Furthermore, the Session class in sessions.py, which inherits from SessionRedirectMixin, is briefly examined to understand how the resolve_redirects method is integrated into the session handling logic. Overall, the provided code spans directly address the reported issue.",

Additionally, the 'PreparedRequest' class in 'models.py' is referenced for managing request objects during the redirection process. The presence of these sections indicates that the codebase already has mechanisms in place to manage and adjust request methods based on redirection status codes.
