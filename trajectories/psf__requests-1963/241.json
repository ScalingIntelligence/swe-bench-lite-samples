The search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin` class which defines the `resolve_redirects` method. This method is responsible for handling redirections, and it is where the problem lies. The method starts by copying the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) and then proceeds to adjust the method based on the response status code. However, as the issue points out, this approach causes the original request method to be used in subsequent iterations, which can lead to incorrect method selection. The provided code spans are relevant to the issue as they encapsulate the problematic behavior in `resolve_redirects`. Additionally, the `Session` class inherits from `SessionRedirectMixin`, indicating that it will also exhibit the same behavior when handling redirection chains. Overall, the relevant code spans are those that define the `resolve_redirects` method and its implementation, as well as the class structure where this method is used, providing a clear path to addressing the issue.",

The problem arises because the method starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which can lead to incorrect HTTP method selection during redirects. In the provided file context, the `resolve_redirects` method does indeed start by copying the original request object (`prepared_request = req.copy()`). This behavior can potentially cause subsequent requests to use the original method specified in the initial request, regardless of the redirect status codes like 303 (See Other) that should convert POST requests to GET. The provided code does not account for the need to preserve the method changed by the 303 status code across further redirects, which is a gap that could lead to incorrect method usage. The file context includes the relevant method and part of the logic involved in redirect handling, but it lacks specific handling for preserving the method change across multiple redirect cycles.",
