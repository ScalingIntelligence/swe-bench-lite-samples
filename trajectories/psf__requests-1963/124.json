From the search results, it's clear that the function `resolve_redirects` in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class is problematic. It starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which is the root cause of the issue mentioned. The code handling different redirect status codes like 303, 307, etc., modifies the method but only in specific conditions, without considering the chain of redirects. This behavior contradicts the HTTP specification that requires preserving the method during redirects unless explicitly changed by a status code like 303. The identified code spans are crucial for addressing the reported issue as they directly deal with redirect resolution within the session handling in the 'requests' library.",

This likely explains the issue where a POST request is incorrectly being turned into a GET during a redirection chain.

The `PoolManager.urlopen` method in `requests/packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py` could have a connection to the issue given its handling of URL open operations, but it appears to handle redirects differently and might not directly contribute to the issue described.

This likely explains the issue where a POST request is incorrectly being turned into a GET during a redirection chain.

There is, however, a potential issue with code that fails to treat the `307 Temporary Redirect` status code as it should, as per HTTP specifications.\n\n3. **Middleware or Interceptors**: The code provided does not reveal any middleware or interceptors directly influencing the `resolve_redirects` method. However, there might be external configurations or settings through environment variables or middleware not shown in this snippet that could affect request handling during redirections.\n\nTo fully address the issue, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into the specific handling of the 307 status code and investigate potential middleware or configuration settings that might alter the behavior of request methods during redirection flows.",

This behavior is likely to occur when a redirection chain includes responses with status codes like 303, 307, etc., as the method handling does not correctly handle all redirection cases as expected. The provided code context and search results highlight the relevant portions of the `Session` class and its `resolve_redirects` method in the `requests/sessions.py` file. The search results confirm the presence of the `SessionRedirectMixin` class with the `resolve_redirects` method, which iterates over redirect responses and modifies the request method based on the response status, but it starts by copying the original request for each iteration, which may be problematic. The `requests/api.py` file is also relevant as it provides the public API for the library, containing functions that utilize the `Session` class directly or indirectly. Additional files like `requests/packages/__init__.py` and `requests/cookies.py` do not directly relate to the issue at hand but are part of the broader library context. Given the issue description and the provided search results, the focus should remain on the `requests/sessions.py` file and the `resolve_redirects` method within it for a solution to the reported issue.",

This method is responsible for handling redirection logic based on HTTP status codes. Key points to note include: \n\n1. **Handling Specific Redirection Status Codes**: The method explicitly handles status codes such as 303 (See Other), 302 (Found), and 301 (Moved) by altering the request method to 'GET' if the original method was not 'HEAD'. \n\n2. **Generic Redirection Handling**: For other redirection status codes, the method does not change the request method. There is, however, a potential issue with code that fails to treat the `307 Temporary Redirect` status code as it should, as per HTTP specifications.\n\n3. **Middleware or Interceptors**: The code provided does not reveal any middleware or interceptors directly influencing the `resolve_redirects` method. However, there might be external configurations or settings through environment variables or middleware not shown in this snippet that could affect request handling during redirections.\n\nTo fully address the issue, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into the specific handling of the 307 status code and investigate potential middleware or configuration settings that might alter the behavior of request methods during redirection flows.",
