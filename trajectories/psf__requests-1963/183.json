The key problem described is that this method copies the original request for all subsequent requests, which leads to incorrect method selection during redirection. The provided search results contain code spans from the `requests/sessions.py` file, which include the implementation of the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method. This method has logic that deals with handling different types of HTTP redirection status codes, such as 303, 307, etc., and adjusts the request method accordingly. The logic inside `resolve_redirects` aligns with the issue described, suggesting that a GET method should be used following a 303 status code but should preserve the original method (such as GET) for subsequent 307 status codes. The code span 'resolve_redirects' is therefore highly relevant as it directly addresses the issue by showing how the method adjusts the request method based on the redirection status.",

The provided code already includes some handling of method changes based on the status code.
