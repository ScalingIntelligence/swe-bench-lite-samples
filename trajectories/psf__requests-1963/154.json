The primary concern is that the original request object is copied, which causes the wrong HTTP method to be used during subsequent redirects. To address this, we should focus our search on the `sessions.py` file where the `Session` and `SessionRedirectMixin` classes are defined. Specifically, we should look into the `resolve_redirects` method to understand how the original request object is being handled and copied. Additionally, we should also look into the `PreparedRequest` class in the `models.py` file as it contains the `prepare_method` and `copy` methods, which might be relevant to how the request method is being preserved.",
