The provided search results contain the implementation of `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` which is pertinent to the issue. Key parts of the method handle copying the original request, adjusting the HTTP method based on the status code, and preparing the new request. This code directly relates to the issue by outlining how the HTTP method is changed incorrectly due to always starting with a copy of the original request object rather than the method from the previous request in the redirection chain.

Specifically, when encountering a 303 See Other redirect after a POST request, the method should be changed to GET.

The current implementation starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which causes it to incorrectly issue a POST request after a 307 redirect following a 303.
