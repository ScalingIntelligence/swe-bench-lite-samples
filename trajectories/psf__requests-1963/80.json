Specifically, this issue points out that the method selection should change based on the redirect status code, but it currently starts each iteration by copying the original request object, leading to the continuation of the original method (like POST). The search results reveal the implementation of `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` in the `sessions.py` file. This method iterates through the redirection chain, preparing a new request for each redirect. Key lines in the code that handle the method selection during redirects are identified, including conditional checks for status codes '303 See Other', '302 Found', and '301 Moved Permanently', which potentially handle the conversion of POST to GET. However, the critical issue arises from the line 'prepared_request = req.copy()', where the original request is copied, which perpetuates the original method. This understanding supports the need to update the method based on the redirection status code without reverting to the original request's method.",

The problem specifically arises due to the method copying the original request for all subsequent redirects, thus not correctly updating the request method based on the response status codes like 303 or 307. The search results were most relevant in the `requests/sessions.py` file, particularly the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` span, where the copying of the original request occurs. This function also contains the logic that should potentially update the request method based on the redirection status codes. However, the current implementation might not correctly handle the transition from POST to GET and then subsequent redirection with the same GET method. Additionally, the `requests/adapters.py` file was inspected for any relevant logic concerning the handling of HTTP methods and redirection, but it primarily contains implementation details for HTTPAdapter and not directly related to the method-handling issue. The `requests/models.py` file was also examined for the `PreparedRequest.copy` method, which shows the exact action of copying the original request which might need to be modified to address the issue. Based on this analysis, I conclude that the key sections to focus on for addressing the reported issue are in the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` and possibly in the `PreparedRequest.copy`.",
