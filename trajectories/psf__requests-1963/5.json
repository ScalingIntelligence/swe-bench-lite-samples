Specifically, it mentions that the function starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which leads to a scenario where a subsequent 307 redirect should preserve the GET method but instead issues a POST. The search results provide the relevant code spans necessary to address this issue. The `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method is the primary focus, with its logic involving the copying of the original request and the handling of different redirect status codes. This method is defined within the `requests/sessions.py` file and appears to handle various aspects of handling redirects, including the method alteration based on status codes. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method is identified as a part of the code that constructs a copy of a request, which is directly related to the copying of the original request mentioned in the issue.",
