            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the `Session.resolve_redirects` method, which improperly copies the original request for all subsequent requests, leading to incorrect method selection after a redirect. The primary focus is on how the method treats HTTP status codes like 303, 307, and 301 during redirects. Specifically, after a 303 See Other, the method should convert a POST to a GET, but subsequent 307 should preserve the GET rather than reverting to the original POST method. The provided search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin` class which contains the `resolve_redirects` method. This method is responsible for handling redirects by copying the original request at each step, which is the root cause of the issue. The code block provided matches the description of the problem: it copies the original request (req.copy()) and only changes the method based on the status code of the previous response. For 303 See Other, it correctly changes the method to GET, but for subsequent 307 Temporary Redirects, it does not preserve the GET and instead reverts to the original method stored in `req`, which is incorrect. Therefore, this code span is highly relevant to the reported issue, as it directly addresses the method responsible for handling redirects and the specific problem it presents.",
