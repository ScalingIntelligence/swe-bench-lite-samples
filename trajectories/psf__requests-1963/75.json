This can lead to incorrect method selection, specifically in scenarios involving status codes like 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect. Reviewing the provided code, the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class does indeed start each iteration by copying the original request object. This behavior was identified as the cause of the issue. Specifically, the method copies the original request at the beginning of the loop with `prepared_request = req.copy()`, which does not account for changes in the request method due to redirection status codes like 303, potentially causing it to issue a POST request even when the method should be GET due to the 303 status code. The relevance of this code span to the issue is clear, as it directly involves the method responsible for handling redirects and is where the problem originates.",
