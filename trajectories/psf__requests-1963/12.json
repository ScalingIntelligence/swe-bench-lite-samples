However, the current implementation of `resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the original request, which results in the wrong method being used. The relevant files and functions to investigate are within the 'requests' library, particularly in the 'sessions.py', 'models.py', and 'adapters.py' files. Specifically, focus should be on the 'Session', 'SessionRedirectMixin', 'PreparedRequest', and 'HTTPAdapter' classes and their methods.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a significant problem with the Session.resolve_redirects method in the Requests library. When dealing with redirection, the method is overly reliant on copying the original request, which leads to incorrect preservation of the HTTP method. This can be seen in the behavior described where a POST request, after a 303 redirection, incorrectly remains as a POST despite being transformed into a GET as per the HTTP specification. A vital component to address is the logic handling the HTTP methods during redirects, particularly dealing with status codes like 303, 307, which require special handling to preserve or change the method accordingly.\n\nAnalyzing the provided code spans and their context:\n1. The SessionRedirectMixin class contains the resolve_redirects method which initiates each iteration by copying the original request. This code span is directly related to the reported issue.\n2. Class methods within Session and PreparedRequest, such as copy and prepare_method, are connected indirectly through the resolve_redirects method, influencing how requests are copied and prepared during redirection handling.\n3. Additionally, the HTTPAdapter class, though not directly implicated in the issue, is integral to the broader context of send and request handling in the Session class.\n\nTo ensure the completeness of the task, I have identified the following relevant code spans: SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects, Session, and specific methods in PreparedRequest (init, prepare, and copy). These selections cover the core logic involved in the reported issue related to redirection and HTTP method handling.",
