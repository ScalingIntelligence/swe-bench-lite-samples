The method is incorrectly copying the original request object for all subsequent requests, which leads to incorrect method selection during redirection chains. The problem specifically occurs when a 303 See Other status code changes the method from POST to GET, and a subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET but instead reverts to POST. The relevant files include `requests/sessions.py`, `requests/models.py`, and potentially `requests/adapters.py` as they deal with session handling, request preparation, and method handling.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a problem with `Session.resolve_redirects` copying the original request object for all subsequent requests, which can lead to incorrect method selection during redirection. This behavior is not handling the HTTP status codes correctly, specifically in the scenario described where a 303 See Other should convert a POST to a GET, and a subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET. However, because the original request is being copied, it incorrectly uses the original method (POST) instead of the expected GET.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans are found in `requests/sessions.py` under `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`. This method is responsible for handling redirections and copies the original request each time. The code needs to adjust how it handles the method based on the HTTP status code received. It should not blindly copy the original request but rather update the method based on the redirection response.\n\nThe class `PreparedRequest` in `requests/models.py` also contains methods related to copying and preparing the request, which are crucial to understanding how the request object is being handled. Specifically, the `copy` method in `PreparedRequest` is used to duplicate the request object, which is then used in the redirection handling. Ensuring that this method correctly updates the method type based on the redirection response can address the reported issue.\n\nAdditionally, `HTTPAdapter` in `requests/adapters.py` is part of the request sending process and interacts with the `PreparedRequest`. While not directly containing the issue, understanding its role in sending requests helps in a complete picture of how redirections and method handling are processed.",
