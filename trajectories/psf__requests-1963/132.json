Specifically, when encountering a 303 See Other status code, the method incorrectly preserves the original request method instead of switching to GET as specified by the HTTP standard. The search results provided contain several relevant sections of code, including:\n\n- The `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method, which is central to the issue as it handles redirection logic. This method copies the original request at the start of each iteration, causing the preservation of the original method.\n- The `PreparedRequest.copy` method, which is used within `resolve_redirects` to create copies of the original request. Understanding this method is crucial to grasp how the original request attributes are preserved.\n- The `Session.prepare_request` method, which prepares the request before sending. This method could be relevant to ensure that the correct method (like GET after a 303 redirect) is properly set in the prepared request.\n\nGiven the issue description and the code context provided, these sections are directly related to the problem. By focusing on modifying `resolve_redirects` to correctly handle the conversion of POST to GET upon a 303 redirect and ensuring subsequent redirects preserve the correct method, the issue can be addressed.",
