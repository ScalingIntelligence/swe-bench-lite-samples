This behavior can cause incorrect HTTP methods to be used during redirection chains involving status codes like 303 and 307. The main focus should be on the `Session` and `SessionRedirectMixin` classes in `sessions.py`, and the `resolve_redirects` method. Additionally, considering the role of `PreparedRequest` in handling request preparation, and `HTTPAdapter` in managing HTTP transports, these classes should be reviewed as well. The search should initially focus on these specific classes and methods to identify the code handling redirection resolution and request copying.",

Specifically, after a 303 redirect, the method should convert a POST to GET, but subsequent 307 redirects should preserve the GET method. However, the current implementation starts each iteration with a copy of the original request, which might not update the method correctly. The search results show the relevant code in the `requests/sessions.py` file under the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, particularly the `resolve_redirects` method. This method handles the redirection logic, including copying the original request, adjusting the URL and method based on the response status code, and making subsequent requests. The results also include related methods in the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py`, which is used to prepare the request for sending, including setting the method and body. These parts of the code are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue related to method selection during redirects.",
