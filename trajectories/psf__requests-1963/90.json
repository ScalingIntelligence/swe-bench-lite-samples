This is evident from the provided redirection chain example where a 303 See Other response initially changes a POST to a GET, and a subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET method. However, because `Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request, it ends up using the POST method instead of GET. To address this, we need to find the exact implementation of `resolve_redirects` within the `Session` class in the `requests/sessions.py` file and inspect how the original request is being copied and handled during redirect resolution.",

The provided search results include the method `resolve_redirects` from `SessionRedirectMixin`. This method handles redirection logic, including the copying of the original request object and the handling of various HTTP status codes. This is directly relevant to the issue, as the problem described involves how the method operates with different redirect statuses, particularly how it changes the HTTP method based on the status code. The logic within `resolve_redirects` processes the HTTP method changes based on status codes like 303 and 307, but it still copies the original request, which is the root cause of the reported issue. Therefore, the provided code span is relevant to the problem statement and should be considered for further analysis and potential modification.",
