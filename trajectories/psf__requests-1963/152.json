This can lead to incorrect HTTP method selection, as observed in the example where a POST request is incorrectly being converted to a GET and then back to a POST after a 307 Temporary Redirect. To address this, we need to identify where the method copying and redirection handling logic is defined in the codebase.",

This issue is specifically related to how the initial request object is being copied for each redirect iteration, leading to the wrong method being selected for subsequent requests. The search results include the implementation of `Session.resolve_redirects` in the `requests/sessions.py` file. This code snippet is highly relevant as it contains the exact method where the problematic behavior is occurring. In this method, the initial request is copied at the beginning of each iteration, which can cause the method to be incorrectly set to the original request's method rather than following the HTTP specification for redirects. This alignment with the issue description suggests that the code span identified is directly related to the reported problem. Since the critical method `resolve_redirects` has been found in the search results and directly addresses the issue, the search task can be considered complete for now.",
