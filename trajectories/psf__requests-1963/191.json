In `requests/sessions.py`, the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method is directly responsible for handling redirections and copying the original request. The method contains logic to handle different status codes and modify the request method accordingly, as needed for redirections (e.g., converting POST to GET for certain status codes). However, it always starts by copying the original request, which might not be desirable. In `requests/models.py`, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method is used to duplicate requests, but it does not have logic to remember changes made during redirection handling, which could be necessary to preserve correct method selection.
