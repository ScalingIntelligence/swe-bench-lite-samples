The span with id 'SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects', which contains the definition of the resolve_redirects method. This method is responsible for handling redirects and demonstrates precisely the behavior described in the issue. The method starts by copying the original request and deciding the method to use based on the status codes, which can lead to incorrect method selection as mentioned in the issue.\n2. The span with id 'Session', which shows the Session class inheriting from `SessionRedirectMixin` and can help to understand the bigger context and what calls the `resolve_redirects` method.\n\nThese spans provide clear evidence related to the issue.

The provided file context shows the `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` and its `resolve_redirects` method. In the `resolve_redirects` method, the original request object (`req`) is indeed copied (`prepared_request = req.copy()`), which maintains the original method. There are conditions to change the method based on the status code (e.g., converting POST to GET for 303), but the original request object is always copied first.
