It appears that the method starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which can cause the incorrect method to be selected during subsequent redirects. This issue is particularly important for ensuring correct HTTP method behavior across redirection chains.\n\nThe provided search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and its `resolve_redirects` method, which directly addresses the issue. The method defines how redirects are resolved and handles copying of the request object, method determination, and other related operations. This includes copying the original request, adjusting the URL and method based on the response status code, and preparing the new request. It seems crucial to review and potentially modify this method to address the reported issue.\n\nAdditionally, the search results include the `Session` class, which inherits from `SessionRedirectMixin`, indicating the broader context in which these redirects are resolved. Also included is the `PreparedRequest` class, which is likely used in the `resolve_redirects` method to prepare and copy requests, emphasizing the need to ensure that these copies correctly manage the HTTP method used in further requests.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue, focusing on the sections that handle redirect resolution, request preparation, and method handling.",
