Specifically, the `Session.resolve_redirects` method copies the original request for all subsequent requests, which can cause incorrect method selection. This is evident in the redirection chain provided, where a POST to /do_something results in a 303 See Other, converting the POST to a GET. However, a subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET method, but because the original request object is copied, a POST is issued instead. To address this, we need to focus on the `Session.resolve_redirects` method and how it handles the HTTP methods during redirection. The relevant files to investigate are `sessions.py`, `models.py`, and potentially `adapters.py` as they deal with session management, request preparation, and HTTP method handling respectively.",

Specifically, it mentions that the method should preserve the HTTP method according to the redirection rules (e.g., 303 should change POST to GET, while 307 should preserve the method). The provided search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and its `resolve_redirects` method, which seems to handle redirections. The logic inside this method needs to be reviewed. There's a `prepared_request = req.copy()` line that suggests the original request is being copied at the start of each redirection loop, which might be causing the problem described. Additional checks and modifications of the method based on the redirection status code are implemented within the loop, but the critical part is how the method is updated. The code checks for specific status codes like 303 and changes the method to GET, which aligns with the issue description. Therefore, this section of the code is highly relevant to the reported issue.",
