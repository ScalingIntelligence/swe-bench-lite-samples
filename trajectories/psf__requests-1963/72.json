Specifically, the problem is that this method copies the original request for all subsequent requests, which can lead to incorrect method selection during redirects. This is evident from the provided code snippet where the original request is copied at the start of each redirect loop using `req.copy()`. This behavior does not properly account for HTTP status codes that alter the request method, such as 303 See Other, which should change a POST request to a GET. The code attempts to handle this by explicitly changing the method to GET if the status code is 303, but the issue persists due to the continued use of the copied original request object. Given the detailed description and the provided code, it is clear that the issue lies within the `resolve_redirects` method of the `SessionRedirectMixin` class.",

Instead, it appears to convert certain methods based on other status codes like 303, but it does not have a condition to preserve the method for 307. This suggests that the issue of incorrect method selection during a 307 redirect still exists. Therefore, while the relevant method and class are identified, the complete fix for the issue described, particularly preserving the HTTP method for a 307 redirect, is not present.",
