This behavior can be observed in the provided search result, particularly in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and its `resolve_redirects` method. The code shows that in the redirect resolution loop, the original request is copied at the beginning of each iteration using `prepared_request = req.copy()`. Furthermore, the logic for handling status codes, such as `303 See Other`, `307 Temporary Redirect`, etc., is also present in this method. For example, when encountering a `303 See Other` status code, the method changes the request method to 'GET'. This direct involvement in handling and altering request methods indicates that this code span is highly relevant to the reported issue.",
