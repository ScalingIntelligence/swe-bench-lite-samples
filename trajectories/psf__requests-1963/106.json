The search results show the relevant parts of the `requests/sessions.py` module, including the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and its `resolve_redirects` method. This method is indeed copying the original request at the beginning of the loop (prepared_request = req.copy()). This behavior is causing the incorrect method (POST instead of GET) to be issued during a redirection chain as described in the issue. The code spans provided within the `resolve_redirects` method directly address the issue by demonstrating how the original request is copied and how methods are reassigned based on the status codes (303 See Other, 307 Temporary Redirect,etc). Therefore, these code spans are relevant and directly linked to the reported issue.",
