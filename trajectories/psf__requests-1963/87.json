I analyzed the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method in the search results. It appears that the method indeed copies the original request object on each iteration, which is likely the cause of the reported issue. This method handles redirection logic, including checking for specific HTTP status codes and adjusting the request method accordingly. However, since it always starts by copying the original request, it does not properly preserve the method changes after certain redirections, such as 303 See Other, leading to potential incorrect method selection.
