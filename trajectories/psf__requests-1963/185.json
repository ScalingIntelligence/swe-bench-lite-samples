Specifically, it mentions that when handling a redirection chain, the method copies the original request for all subsequent requests, which can lead to incorrect HTTP method selection. This behavior is observed in the provided search results within the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method. The method initializes a loop where it checks if the response is a redirect and then proceeds to copy the original request using `prepared_request = req.copy()`. This copy operation leads to retaining the original request's method, which can conflict with redirection rules that intend to change the method (like a 303 redirect converting a POST to a GET). The severity of this can cause subsequent 307 redirects to incorrectly issue a POST request instead of preserving the GET request. The search results also indicate that this behavior is intricately connected with how the `PreparedRequest` class handles method and body preparation in its `prepare` method, emphasizing the need to review the entirety of the class and its role in the redirection process.",

Specifically, the issue notes that when encountering a 303 status code, the method should convert a POST to a GET, but subsequent 307 status codes should preserve the method. Examining the provided `Session` and `PreparedRequest` classes in the file context, it is evident that the `resolve_redirects` method indeed copies the original request at the beginning of each redirection loop. This behavior aligns with the issue description. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest` class includes a `copy` method that performs a shallow copy of the request attributes, which is used in the redirection logic. From the provided code, it appears that the relevant parts of the issue are addressed in the form of the existing codebase.
