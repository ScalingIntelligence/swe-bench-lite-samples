The problem is evident when handling status codes like 303 and 307. To address this, we need to focus on the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and the `resolve_redirects` method within it. We should also check the `Session` class and its methods like `prepare_request` and `request` as they might interact with the redirection handling. Additionally, examining the `PreparedRequest` class in `models.py` and the `HTTPAdapter` class in `adapters.py` could provide more context on how requests are prepared and processed, respectively.",

To address this, we need to identify the code spans related to how the redirection process is managed and how the request method is determined and modified during redirections.\n\nFirst, we need to locate the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and its `resolve_redirects` method, which handles the redirection logic. This method is found in `sessions.py`.\n\nWithin `resolve_redirects`, the logic for managing different status codes and methods is crucial. We see that the method checks for specific status codes and modifies the request method accordingly, but it starts each iteration by copying the original request object. This behavior is potentially problematic and needs to be explored further.\n\nAdditionally, the `PreparedRequest` class and its methods (`copy`, `prepare_method`, etc.) in `models.py` are relevant because they define how a request object is prepared and copied, which plays a role in the redirection process. Specifically, `PreparedRequest.copy` is used within `resolve_redirects` to start each iteration with a copy of the original request object, which could lead to incorrect method selection if not managed properly.\n\nOverall, the relevant code spans are found in both `sessions.py` and `models.py`, covering the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method and the `PreparedRequest` class and its related methods. These sections of code are critical for understanding and potentially fixing the issue with incorrect method selection during redirections.",
