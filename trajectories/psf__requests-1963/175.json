The problem arises because the original request object is copied for each redirection iteration, failing to update the method based on HTTP status codes such as 303 (See Other) which should change POST to GET. To address this, the search should focus on the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` and `Session` classes in the `sessions.py` file. Additionally, examining the code around how methods are prepared and sent in the `PreparedRequest` class in `models.py` might provide more context.",

However, due to the copying of the original request, Requests will issue a POST instead of preserving the GET method.\n\nUpon analyzing the search results, the relevant code spans are located in the `requests/sessions.py` file, specifically within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and its `resolve_redirects` method. This method handles the redirection process and copies the original request, which is the root cause of the issue mentioned. The method sets the new request method based on the status codes, but because it starts by copying the original request, it does not preserve the method correctly after a 307 status code.\n\nThe identified relevant code spans are:\n- `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`: This method contains the logic responsible for handling redirects and directly addresses the issue by copying the original request and setting the method incorrectly.\n\nThese spans are crucial as they directly involve the method that is not behaving as expected according to the reported issue.",

Specifically: 1. After copying the prepared request, determine the correct method based on the response status code and update the method in the prepared request accordingly before processing each redirect.\n\nThe instructions require modifying the method update logic based on response status codes. The lines between 137 and 144 handle the method update but rely on a variable 'method' which is set earlier in the code. To fulfill the instruction, these lines need to be adjusted to directly update the 'prepared_request.method' based on the response status code without relying on the 'method' variable.",
