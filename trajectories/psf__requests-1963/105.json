This behavior is problematic for status codes like 303 and 307 where the method should change under specific conditions but not necessarily copied from the original request. By examining the provided code, we can see the definition of the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. This method indeed starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which is problematic for the functionality described in the issue. This part of the code needs to be adjusted to potentially check the current status code and modify the method accordingly without always defaulting to the original request's method. It is crucial for fixing the described issue. I will mark this method as relevant to continue the analysis and possible solutions development.",

However, it appears that the handling of the 307 status code could indeed lead to incorrect method selection if it starts with the original request method. This matches the issue's description about the potential problem with POST being used instead of preserving GET. Based on the provided context, all relevant code concerning the `resolve_redirects` method and its handling of request methods during redirects seems to be included.
