To address this, I analyzed the provided `requests/sessions.py` file. The relevant code spans are identified in the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method, which is crucial as it handles the redirection logic. This method's behavior aligns with the described issue: it starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which can lead to incorrect method selection during redirection. Specifically, the code segments where the method changes and where the request is copied are critical to understanding the issue. Since the issue suggests handling redirection more accurately based on HTTP status codes, examining this method is essential to understand the current behavior. Thus, the identified code spans are directly related to the reported issue, making it clear where the problem lies.",
