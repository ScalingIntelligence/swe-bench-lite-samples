Additionally, logic to handle different redirect status codes like 303 See Other is present, which should convert the method to GET but doesn't account for preserving the method correctly in subsequent redirects if the original request method is copied. The second span, 'SessionRedirectMixin', and the fourth span, 'Session', also provide context for where this method resides within the Session class hierarchy.

However, it does not specifically handle the scenario where a 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the original method. Suggestions for improvement would be to add a condition to handle 307 redirections by preserving the original request method. Given the current state of the file context, it appears that the relevant class and area for modification are identified, even though the exact solution is not fully present.
