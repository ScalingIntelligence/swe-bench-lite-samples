By examining the code in the `requests/sessions.py` file, we can see the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. This method handles the redirection logic and indeed appears to start each iteration by copying the original request object. This behavior could cause the incorrect method selection as described in the issue. The method checks for specific status codes (303, 302, 301) and alters the method to GET under certain conditions, but it does not seem to account for preserving the method correctly across multiple redirections. Thus, the relevant code spans are within the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method, particularly where the original request is copied and where the method is altered based on status codes.",
