Additionally, we should look into the `request` method in the `Session` class and the `urlopen` method in the `PoolManager` class in `urllib3/poolmanager.py` to ensure proper handling of redirection status codes and method preservation.

To address this, I need to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle redirection and method changes based on HTTP status codes such as 303, 307, and 301. The search results provide several key spans of code: 1. `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`: This method contains the logic for handling redirects and modifying the request method based on status codes. 2. `Session.__init__`: This initializes the `Session` class, which inherits from `SessionRedirectMixin`. 3. `Session.request`: This method is where the actual request is made and redirected if necessary. 4. `PreparedRequest.copy`: This is crucial for understanding how the original request is copied, which is central to the issue at hand. I can see that the `resolve_redirects` method copies the original request and then modifies the method based on the status code. This suggests that the main issue arises from the use of the copy method without consideration for the method changes made during redirection. The other files and methods provide context but do not directly address the main issue. Therefore, I will focus on the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` and related methods such as `PreparedRequest.copy`.",

However, the method starts by copying the original request object, which can lead to incorrect method preservation due to the original POST request being copied over despite the intended method change indicated by the HTTP status codes. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest` class and the `request` method in the `Session` class are also relevant as they play a part in preparing and sending requests.
