The identified span in `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` shows the method's implementation, including how requests are copied and processed. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method in the models.py file is crucial, as it defines how the request objects are actually copied, which is directly related to the bug described.",
