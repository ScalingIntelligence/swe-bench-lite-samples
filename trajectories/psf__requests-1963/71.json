This method copies the original request using `req.copy()` and modifies the method based on the redirection status code. The code span includes logic to convert POST to GET on certain status codes but preserves the method incorrectly if the original request is copied.\n\nIn `requests/models.py`, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method is relevant as it is used to create a copy of the request, which is problematic if the original method is preserved. This method initializes a new `PreparedRequest` object and copies the method and other attributes from the original.\n\nBoth of these spans are relevant to the reported issue, and the analysis shows they directly address the handling of redirection and method preservation.",
