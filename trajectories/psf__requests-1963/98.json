The issue specifies that the method incorrectly copies the original request for all subsequent requests, leading to the incorrect method being used during redirects, particularly when encountering status codes like 303, 307, etc. After analyzing the provided code spans, it's evident that the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method handles redirects but does not properly update the method based on the redirection status codes, thus causing the described problem. This method is identified as relevant since it is directly responsible for managing the redirection process, including the handling of different HTTP methods for various redirect scenarios.\n\nReviewing the entire `resolve_redirects` method, it becomes clear that the method selection is determined early in the method by copying the original request and then adjusting the method only for specific status codes without considering the need to preserve the method across all appropriate redirects, particularly 307 which should preserve the method according to HTTP standards. Hence, this method and its handling of method selection during redirects are identified as the most relevant to the reported issue.",
