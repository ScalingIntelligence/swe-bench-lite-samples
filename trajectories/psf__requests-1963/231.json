The problem occurs because the original request object is being copied for each iteration, which can cause the incorrect HTTP method to be used. To address this, we need to identify where in the codebase the original request is being copied and whether it's being used to create subsequent requests. The files provided suggest that the relevant code could be in 'sessions.py' and 'models.py', focusing on the Session and PreparedRequest classes respectively. Additionally, investigating the 'adapters.py' file for possible method handling during redirects might be useful.",

Upon reviewing the search results, the pertinent sections include the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and the `resolve_redirects` method within `requests/sessions.py`, which manages the redirection logic. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py` is crucial as it involves the creation and copying of request objects, which is central to the issue at hand. The `PreparedRequest.copy` method is particularly relevant as it directly affects how the original request is duplicated during redirects.

The provided context and search results help identify relevant code spans. First, the issue description makes it clear that the problem lies in how `Session.resolve_redirects` handles copies of the original request and how it updates the request method based on the HTTP status codes it encounters during redirects. This points directly to the implementation of `resolve_redirects` in the `SessionRedirectMixin`. \n\nNext, examining the context, we see the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method where the original request is indeed copied at the start of each redirection loop. Inside this method, there are conditional checks that modify the HTTP method based on the status code of the redirect response, such as switching a POST to a GET for a 303 status code. However, if the next redirect is a 307 (or 308 for permanent redirects that aren't listed in the issue but might also need similar handling), the method doesn't currently handle preserving the already switched method (GET) if the redirect chain has already been altered by a 303.\n\nSimultaneously, the search results provide additional context with the `HTTPAdapter.send` method, which is critical for understanding how requests are actually sent after being prepared in the `Session` class. This method shows how HTTPS requests are handled and how responses are built. While it doesn't directly address the issue of method switching in redirects, understanding how requests and responses are handled can guide adjustments in the `Session.resolve_redirects` method to ensure that the correct method is used after a redirect chain intervention.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the key relevant code spans include the entire `resolve_redirects` method, as it directly addresses how request objects are managed during redirects and how the HTTP method is adjusted based on redirect status codes. The `HTTPAdapter.send` method is contextual for broader understanding but not directly altering to fix the issue at hand.",
