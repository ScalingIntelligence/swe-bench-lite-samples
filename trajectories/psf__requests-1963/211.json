To address this, the code spans related to the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method in 'requests/sessions.py' are of primary interest. This method deals directly with handling redirection logic and seems to be where the issue occurs. Inside this method, the copying of the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) is highlighted as the potential problem. Furthermore, the logic for determining the method (`method = req.method` and subsequent checks for status codes like 303, 307) suggest where adjustments might be necessary to ensure the correct method is selected. Additionally, understanding how `PreparedRequest` objects are copied (`PreparedRequest.copy`) in 'requests/models.py' is important for a complete understanding of how the request object is managed across redirections. Based on the code spans provided, these sections are directly relevant to the reported issue and should provide enough context to determine the next steps for addressing the problem.",
