Upon analyzing the provided code, it's evident that this method is responsible for handling redirections. Here, the issue can be traced back to the line `prepared_request = req.copy()`, which ensures that each iteration starts with a copy of the original request, leading to incorrect method selection across different redirection status codes (like 303, 307, etc.). To address this issue, the method should consider updating the request method dynamically based on the redirection status code, which is partially done but needs to be corrected or enhanced to avoid incorrectly preserving the original request method in certain scenarios. This can be done by further refining the conditions where the method is set to 'GET' based on specific redirection codes.",
