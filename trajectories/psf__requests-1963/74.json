To address this, it's crucial to identify the relevant code spans that handle the redirection logic and the copying of the original request. The search results include several key spans: 'SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects' where the problematic behavior is described, 'Session' which encapsulates this mixin, and 'Session.send' where the redirection handling is triggered. These spans collectively provide the context needed to understand and potentially fix the issue of incorrect method selection during redirections.
