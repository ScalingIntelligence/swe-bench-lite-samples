            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights a problem with the `Session.resolve_redirects` method, where it mistakenly copies the original request leading to incorrect method selection during redirection. This is particularly evident in scenarios where the HTTP status code changes the request method (e.g., from POST to GET due to a 303 See Other response), but subsequent redirections should maintain the updated method (e.g., GET following a 307 Temporary Redirect). Addressing this requires modifications in how the redirection logic handles the request throughout the process.\n\n From the search results, the focus is on the `requests/sessions.py` file, which contains critical parts of the redirection handling logic. Specifically, within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, the `resolve_redirects` method is where most of the action is happening. This method is responsible for managing the redirection chain, including copying the initial request, handling different HTTP status codes, and preparing subsequent requests based on the response. It also correctly handles changing the request method when necessary due to HTTP status codes (like converting POST to GET for 303) and preserves the method for 307 redirections.\n\n While this section of code appears to address changes in request methods based on HTTP status codes, it seems to incorrectly start each iteration by copying the original request, which contradicts the need to maintain the updated method for subsequent redirections. Thus, the identified code spans are relevant as they outline the current behavior of the `resolve_redirects` method, paving the way for potential modifications to solve the issue.\n\n Additionally, understanding the `Session` class and its initialization may help in understanding the broader context and how sessions are configured with defaults like `max_redirects` and various other settings. Furthermore, the `PreparedRequest` class and its methods in the `models.py` file are crucial in preparing and handling the requests which undergo transformation during the redirection process, especially the `copy` method used in `resolve_redirects`.\n\n This analysis identifies the relevant sections of the codebase that need to be addressed to fix the issue described. It involves modifying the behavior of the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` to ensure that it does not always start with a copy of the original request but instead maintains the current state of the request, thus preserving the correct HTTP method across redirections.",
