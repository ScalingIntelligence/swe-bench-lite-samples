Upon inspecting the `requests/sessions.py` file, several key points identified include: \n\n1. The `SessionRedirectMixin` class and its `resolve_redirects` method, which is responsible for handling redirects. \n2. The method starts each iteration by copying the original request object (`prepared_request = req.copy()`), which is likely the cause of the incorrect method selection. \n3. The method handles different status codes, converting the method to 'GET' for certain codes like 303 (see_other). \n4. The method does not correctly handle the preservation of the HTTP method for status codes like 307 (temporary redirect).\n\nBased on these observations, the relevant code spans are those within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, particularly the `resolve_redirects` method. These code spans need to be adjusted to correctly handle the HTTP method during redirects.",
