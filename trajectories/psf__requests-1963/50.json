The core issue is that the original request method is being preserved through each redirect iteration, which can lead to incorrect method selection. To address this, we need to focus on the `resolve_redirects` method within the `Session` class and related classes that handle request preparation and method selection. The search should target the `requests/sessions.py` file where the `Session` class and `SessionRedirectMixin` are defined, as well as any related methods in other files such as `requests/models.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py`.",

This leads to incorrect method selection, especially when dealing with status codes like 303 and 307. \n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the following key sections are identified:\n1. `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` - This is the core function where the redirection logic is handled. It copies the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) and proceeds with the redirection.\n2. `PreparedRequest.copy` - This method is responsible for copying the request object, which is crucial for understanding how the method is preserved or altered during redirections.\n\nThese two spans are directly relevant to the reported issue. They expose the area where the original request is copied, potentially leading to the incorrect method selection. Additional spans in `models.py` related to `PreparedRequest` are also relevant as they show how requests are prepared, including the method.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans provide a clear starting point for addressing the issue. They highlight the exact areas where modifications could be made to improve the handling of request methods during redirections.",
