The search results reveal the `SessionRedirectMixin` class which contains the `resolve_redirects` method in question. This method is responsible for handling the redirection logic in the `requests` library. By examining this method, it's clear that it indeed copies the original request object at the start of each iteration, which can lead to the method selection issue described in the reported issue. Specifically, when encountering a 303 See Other status code during a POST request, the method converts the request to GET. However, subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect status codes should ideally preserve the GET method, but due to the copying of the original request object, a POST request is erroneously issued. This analysis indicates that the provided search results contain the relevant code span that directly addresses the reported issue.",
