The `resolve_redirects` method in `SessionRedirectMixin` and the `request` method in `Session` are likely candidates for containing the logic that needs to be adjusted to handle redirection correctly without inadvertently copying the original request method.",

This is particularly problematic in a redirection chain where the HTTP method needs to be appropriately adjusted (e.g., POST to GET on 303 See Other, but preserving the method on 307 Temporary Redirect). I analyzed the provided code spans and identified key sections handling the resolution of redirects. The function `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` contains the logic for handling redirects, including method adjustments based on HTTP status codes (303, 307, etc.). This function copies the original request at the start of each iteration, but it doesn't appear to take into account the method changes that should have occurred in previous redirects. This seems to be the point of failure described in the issue, and the relevant code spans associated with this issue are in `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`.",
