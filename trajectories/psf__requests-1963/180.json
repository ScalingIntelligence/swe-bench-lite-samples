This behavior can be observed in the provided code snippet from `requests/sessions.py`, where the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class copies the original request at the beginning of each redirection loop. The method then sets the `method` of the `prepared_request` based on the response status code, but it does not consider the state of the previous redirect, which can lead to the incorrect method being selected. Specifically, the issue is demonstrated by the handling of redirection status codes like 303 and 307. For instance, handling a 303 redirect converts the method to 'GET', which is correct, but when the subsequent 307 redirect occurs without modifying the method, it inherits the incorrect method from the original request, which is 'POST' in this case instead of preserving 'GET'. This is a critical area in the code that needs correction to handle redirection chains accurately. Therefore, the identified code span in the `resolve_redirects` method is relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
