Specifically, it mentions that after a 303 See Other redirect, the method should be switched to GET, and subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET method. However, due to the copying of the original request, it reverts to the original POST method. To address this, the relevant code spans include the `resolve_redirects` method itself in `SessionRedirectMixin`, which handles the redirection logic. Additionally, the `copy` method in the `PreparedRequest` class is relevant because it is the method used to create a copy of the original request, leading to the issue described. Examining these sections of code will help in understanding and potentially fixing the problem.",

This ensures that the method from the previous redirect is preserved. The next step is to ensure that the method attributes are updated within each iteration of the redirection process to correctly handle the method changes based on the HTTP status codes. However, it appears that the method handling based on status codes (303, 302, 307) is already correctly addressed in the `resolve_redirects` method. Thus, the initial fix and the current handling seem sufficient to address the reported issue.",
