This behavior is evident in the code span with id 'SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects', where `prepared_request = req.copy()` is used at the start of each redirection loop. This copying of the original request object causes the method to persist incorrectly across redirects.

Hence, the code spans related to 'SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects' and the 'PreparedRequest.copy' method are highly relevant to addressing this issue.

The method logic indicates that it copies the original request for each iteration of redirection handling. This copying mechanism is the root of the issue as it incorrectly preserves the original request's method in certain scenarios, notably when encountering a 307 status code where the method should be preserved. To address this, focus on enhancing the method to properly update the request method when encountering specific status codes like 307. Additionally, scrutinize any related methods or utility functions that could potentially influence how request methods are handled during redirection. Specifically, look for any conditions or updates to the request method within the redirection handling loop that might need adjustment.",
