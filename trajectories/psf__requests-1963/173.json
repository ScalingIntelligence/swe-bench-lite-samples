The key problem is that `resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, which can cause the incorrect method selection, particularly when dealing with redirection chains involving status codes like 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect. The provided search results include the relevant code spans. The `resolve_redirects` method's implementation can be found in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class definition. This method handles the redirection logic, including copying the original request and modifying the method based on the response status code. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest` class spans are relevant as they detail the preparation and copying of requests, which is central to the issue at hand. These spans provide a comprehensive view of how requests are being prepared and handled within the context of redirection.",
