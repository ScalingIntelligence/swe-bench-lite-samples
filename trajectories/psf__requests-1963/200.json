Specifically, it notes that the original request method is being copied for each iteration, leading to incorrect method selection, especially when dealing with status codes like 303 (See Other) and 307 (Temporary Redirect). This issue can be addressed by ensuring that the method for the subsequent requests is set correctly based on the status code of the previous response.\n\nThe search results provide the relevant code spans that deal with redirection handling and method setting in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class within `requests/sessions.py`. The `resolve_redirects` method is where the main logic for redirection handling resides. It contains the code that copies the original request and checks for specific status codes to determine the next request method. This includes handling cases for status codes 303, 302, and 307. The method also checks and updates the URL and headers accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there are relevant spans in `requests/models.py` that involve the `PreparedRequest` class, which defines how a request is prepared, including methods to copy the request and prepare various aspects such as the method, URL, headers, and body. This class is crucial as the `resolve_redirects` method uses it to create new prepared requests.\n\nBased on the analysis, the provided code spans are directly related to the issue reported concerning incorrect method selection during redirects.",
