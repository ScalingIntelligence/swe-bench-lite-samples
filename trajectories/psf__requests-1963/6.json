The code snippet correctly changes the method to 'GET' for a 303 status code but keeps the method unchanged for a 307 status code. This seems to align with the expected behavior described in the issue. Additionally, in `requests/models.py`, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method is responsible for copying the original request, which is directly related to the issue of incorrect method selection. These code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and provide a clear understanding of how the redirection process and request copying are managed.

Specifically, when handling a redirection chain, the method should respect the HTTP status codes that dictate changes in the request method, such as 303 See Other converting a POST to a GET. However, the current implementation starts each iteration by copying the original request, which can result in the wrong method being used (e.g., a POST after a 303 redirect becomes a GET). The provided code spans identify the relevant sections in the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method, and other related methods like `Session.prepare_request` and `Session.send`. These sections are critical for understanding how requests are prepared and sent, and how redirects are resolved. The analysis shows that the implementation might not be correctly handling the change of request method based on the redirection status codes, as the original request method is copied at the start of each redirect iteration rather than adjusting it based on the status code of the current response.",
