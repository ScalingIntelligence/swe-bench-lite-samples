Specifically, when encountering a 303 See Other redirect, the method should convert a POST request to a GET, but after a subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect, the method should preserve the GET request. The problem arises because the original request object is copied again rather than preserving the method from the previous redirect. To address this, we need to focus our search on the `requests/sessions.py` file, particularly within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and its `resolve_redirects` method, as well as any related methods that could be influencing the behavior of handling redirects.",
