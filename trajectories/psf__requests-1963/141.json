To address this, we need to focus on the `resolve_redirects` method and the related request handling logic in the `sessions.py` file. Additionally, since the issue involves redirection and method selection, it may also be relevant to look at how methods are prepared and copied in the `PreparedRequest` class within `models.py`.",

This is evident from the provided redirection chain example where a POST request becomes a GET due to a 303 See Other response, but a subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect incorrectly preserves the original POST method. The search results show the relevant parts of the codebase: in `requests/sessions.py`, there's the `SessionRedirectMixin` class containing the `resolve_redirects` method that handles redirection, and in `requests/models.py`, the `PreparedRequest` class has a `copy` method that duplicates the original request. The issue lies in the `prepared_request = req.copy()` line within `resolve_redirects`, which starts each iteration by copying the original request, rather than the method-adjusted request from the previous step. Understanding these code spans is crucial for addressing the reported issue, as they directly pertain to how Requests library handles redirection and method selection.",
