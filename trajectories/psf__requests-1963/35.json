This can lead to incorrect method selection during redirection, as the method does not update with the new HTTP method determined by the redirection status code. For example, in the provided redirection chain, a `303 See Other` status should convert a `POST` to `GET`, and a subsequent `307 Temporary Redirect` should preserve the `GET`. However, the current implementation will issue a `POST` because it copies the original request, which retains the original method. The method `resolve_redirects` in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class is responsible for handling redirection and needs to be adjusted to update the method based on the redirection status codes. The relevant code spans that address this issue are the method definition and the specific lines where the HTTP method is determined based on the status code. These sections need to be modified to update the request method correctly for redirection handling.",
