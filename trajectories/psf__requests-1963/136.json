In the provided search results, the relevant code spans are located within the `requests/sessions.py` file. Notably, the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method is critical as it handles the redirection logic. It copies the original request object at the beginning of each iteration and checks for redirection status codes (`303`, `307`, etc.), which is directly related to the issue described. The code also checks the method for each request and adjusts it based on the redirection status code, but the mentioned problem persists because the original request method is used for all iterations, not the method determined by the redirection status code.",

The method does copy the original request at the start, which aligns with the problem statement of the original request being used for all subsequent redirects. The logic within the method also addresses handling different HTTP status codes such as 303 See Other, converting POST to GET, and preserving the GET method for subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect. Given this context, it appears that the relevant logic for handling redirects and preserving correct HTTP methods is contained within the provided file context. Therefore, the analysis of the issue and the provided code suggests that all relevant code is present.",
