Specifically, the issue arises due to the copying of the original request object at each redirect iteration, rather than updating it based on the current status, like method changes due to 303 or 307 redirects.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, it is evident that the method `Session.resolve_redirects` is indeed the focus of the issue. The method is found within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and performs the redirect resolution. However, the current implementation immediately copies the original request (`req.copy()`), which can lead to the problem described: the next request after a 307 redirect incorrectly retains the original method (e.g., POST), instead of correctly switching to GET after a 303.\n\nThis method should be adjusted to ensure that after certain status codes (like 303 and 307), the method of the request object is properly updated. Given the relevance and direct connection of this method to the reported issue, this spans the core of the problem and merits further attention to implement a fix.",
