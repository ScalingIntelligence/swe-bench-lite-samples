This is particularly problematic when dealing with redirection codes such as 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect. To address this, focus on the `resolve_redirects` method within the `Session` class and its interactions with the `PreparedRequest` class and the `request` method. Additionally, check the `HTTPAdapter` class for any involvement in handling requests and redirections.",

The goal is to ensure that subsequent redirects preserve the correct HTTP method. The relevant code spans identified include the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method, which is responsible for handling the redirection logic. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest.copy` and `PreparedRequest.prepare_method` methods in the `requests/models.py` file are relevant, as they are involved in copying the request and preparing the HTTP method, respectively.
