After analyzing the search results, I focused on the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method where the issue is likely to occur. This method indeed starts each iteration by copying the original request object using `req.copy()`, potentially leading to the problem described. Since the issue directly pertains to how redirects are handled in the session, the sections related to `Session`, `Session.resolve_redirects`, and the flow of request preparation are crucial for addressing the issue. Other methods such as `Session.prepare_request` and `Session.send` are also relevant as they are part of the request-response cycle and could be involved in how the bug manifests or is solved. The other files and methods listed are part of the broader Request library but not directly implicated in the specific redirection handling problem, hence not crucial for this issue's focus. The identified spans will be the ones from `sessions.py` related to the `Session` class and its methods around redirection handling.",
