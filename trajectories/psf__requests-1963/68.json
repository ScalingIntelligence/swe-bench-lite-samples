This behavior is demonstrated in a redirection chain where a POST request is converted to a GET due to a 303 status code, but a subsequent 307 status code should preserve the GET method. However, the implementation currently starts each iteration of redirection by copying the original request object, which results in a POST method being used instead of the GET. The search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin` class which contains the `resolve_redirects` method. This method handles the resolution of redirects and is where the problematic copying of the original request occurs. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest` class and its methods, such as `copy`, are relevant as they are involved in preparing and copying request objects. Given this analysis, the identified code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue.",
