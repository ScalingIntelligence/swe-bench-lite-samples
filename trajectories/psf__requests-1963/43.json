Specifically, when encountering a 303 See Other status, the method should convert a POST to a GET, and subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET method. However, the method currently does not update the request method correctly, causing subsequent requests to use the original method (e.g., POST) instead of the updated method (e.g., GET). To address this, the search should focus on the `resolve_redirects` method within the `Session` class in the `sessions.py` file. Additionally, investigating the `PreparedRequest` class in `models.py` may provide insights into how the request method is being copied and updated.",

By analyzing the search results, the relevant code can be found in the `requests/sessions.py` file under the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method. This method handles the redirection logic and is where the copying of the original request occurs. The issue description implies that the method selection (GET, POST, etc.) is incorrectly determined during redirection, particularly in the handling of status codes like 303 and 307. The code within the `resolve_redirects` method determines the method for the next request based on the status code, but it starts with the method from the original request rather than the method determined by the status code of the last response. Additionally, it is essential to consider the `copy` method in the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py`, as this is where the original request object is copied from, contributing to the issue identified in the reported problem.",
