The code provided includes the `SessionRedirectMixin` class which defines the `resolve_redirects` method. This method is responsible for handling redirection upon receiving a redirection response. By examining the method, it is evident that the method initially copies the original request and then modifies the method based on the status code of the response. This logic is relevant to the reported issue as it shows how the method selection might go wrong. The loop inside the `resolve_redirects` method iterates until the maximum number of redirects is reached, and during each iteration, it checks the status code to determine whether to change the request method. This includes handling various redirect status codes like 303, 302, and 301. The logic around copying the original request, handling the URL, and the method modification aligns well with the issues described in the reported issue, such as the incorrect conversion from POST to GET during redirection. Therefore, the `resolve_redirects` method should be the main area of focus, as it directly deals with resolving redirects and managing request methods, which are central to the described problem.",
