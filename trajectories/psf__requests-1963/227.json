The key problem highlighted is that the original request method is copied for all subsequent requests, which can lead to incorrect method selection during redirections. This is particularly problematic when the intermediate status codes like 303 See Other cause a method change, but subsequent status codes like 307 Temporary Redirect should not alter the method. The search results contain the `SessionRedirectMixin` class with the `resolve_redirects` method that handles redirection logic. This method is crucial for addressing the reported issue as it directly deals with how request methods are managed during redirection chains. Notably, the method copies the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) at the start of each iteration, which can perpetuate the original method through subsequent redirections, leading to the bug described in the issue. The analysis of the code confirms that modifications in the method handling based on status codes within the `resolve_redirects` method could resolve the issue. Therefore, the identified span within the `SessionRedirectMixin` is deemed highly relevant to the reported issue.",
