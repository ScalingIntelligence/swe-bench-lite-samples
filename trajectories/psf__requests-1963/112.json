This behavior is particularly problematic when handling different HTTP status codes like 303 and 307. Upon analyzing the provided search results, I see that the spans labeled `SessionRedirectMixin` and `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` are directly related to handling and resolving redirects in the `requests` library. The `resolve_redirects` method indeed contains the logic to handle different redirect status codes, including the problematic copying of the original request. This directly addresses the reported issue.\n\nSpecifically, the method `resolve_redirects` is significantly relevant as it defines the core logic for handling redirects and manipulates the method type based on the HTTP status codes. The snippet that dynamically changes the request method based on the response status code (e.g., changing POST to GET for status code 303) is particularly pertinent to the issue at hand.",
