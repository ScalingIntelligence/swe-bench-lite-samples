This issue involves handling HTTP redirection codes (like 303, 307) which should alter the request method appropriately. I examined the `requests/sessions.py` file and specifically the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method. The method currently copies the original request using `req.copy()` each time it processes a redirect, which is the root of the problem as it does not iteratively update the method based on the redirection status codes. Consequently, it does not correctly handle the conversion of POST to GET for status code 303 or preserve the GET method for status code 307. This fault can lead to incorrect HTTP methods being used in subsequent requests after certain redirects. In addition, I reviewed the `requests/models.py` file, particularly the `PreparedRequest` class and its `copy` method. The `copy` method is responsible for replicating the request object, but it does not address the issue of updating the request method dynamically based on redirection status codes, which perpetuates the problem described in the issue report. Identifying and fixing these specific code spans will be crucial to resolving the issue accurately.",
