This can lead to incorrect method selection, such as sending a POST request instead of a GET after a 307 redirect. To address this, it's essential to locate the `resolve_redirects` method in the `Session` class within the `sessions.py` file and the relevant logic in `PreparedRequest` within `models.py`. These methods need to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure that the HTTP method is correctly preserved during redirects. Additionally, understanding how the `HTTPAdapter` and `RequestMethods` classes interact with these methods might be necessary for a comprehensive solution. The search should focus on these specific methods and classes to identify the exact location of the problematic behavior.",

This affects how the library handles certain HTTP status codes, particularly when they suggest a method change (like 303 See Other). The focal point is on the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, which needs to adjust its handling of request methods dynamically based on each redirect response. The code analysis shows the method is copying the original request at the start of each loop iteration. The method checks for certain status codes and correctly changes the method to GET, but the issue arises because it does not carry over the method change to subsequent iterations effectively. This is evident in both the `PreparedRequest` copying in the `copy` method and the method assignment logic within `resolve_redirects`. Addressing this involves ensuring that the method selected after each redirect is preserved and not reset to the original request's method in the next iteration.",
