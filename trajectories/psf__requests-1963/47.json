This behavior is particularly problematic when handling redirection chains involving status codes such as 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect. The relevant code spans are identified as follows:\n1. In 'requests/sessions.py', the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method copies the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) and modifies it based on the redirect status. This is directly related to the issue as it involves how the request method is determined after a redirect.\n2. The `PreparedRequest.copy` method in 'requests/models.py' is invoked by `resolve_redirects` to duplicate the request object. Understanding how this copy operation works is crucial to identifying the root cause of the method selection issue.\n3. Additionally, the `Session.__init__` method defines the `max_redirects` attribute, which sets the maximum number of redirects allowed, though this isn't directly causing the issue, it is contextually relevant.\nBy analyzing these code spans, we can pinpoint areas where the request method handling might be incorrect and address the reported issue.",
