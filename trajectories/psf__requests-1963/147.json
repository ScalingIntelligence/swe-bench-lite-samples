Specifically, it copies the original request method for all subsequent requests, which can lead to incorrect method selection. The provided search results include the `resolve_redirects` method from `SessionRedirectMixin` in `requests/sessions.py`. This method is central to the issue as it outlines the logic for handling redirects. Notably, the method copies the original request at the beginning of each iteration through the while loop, which is likely the cause of the problem described. This needs to be adjusted to consider the actual method based on the response status codes. The code spans related to this method can be checked to see if they cover the necessary adjustments. Since the identified code includes the core logic of `resolve_redirects`, it seems relevant to the issue, suggesting that further review of this section to ensure handling different redirect codes like 303 and preserving the method properly might resolve the issue.",

The code already handles conversion of methods for some specific status codes like 303, 302, and 301. However, the handling of subsequent redirects, especially preserving the correct method after a 303 (which should convert POST to GET), is inadequate since it continues to refer to the original request method, causing it to revert to POST even after a GET should be issued.
