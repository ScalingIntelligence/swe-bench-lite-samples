By analyzing the provided code spans, it's evident that the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class is the central piece of code responsible for this functionality. The method starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which is the primary cause of the incorrect method selection when handling redirection chains. Other relevant spans include the `copy` method in the `PreparedRequest` class, which is used to duplicate the original request, and the `Session.prepare_request` method, which prepares the request before sending it. Additionally, the `Request` and `PreparedRequest` classes are fundamental to understanding how requests are constructed and modified. Identifying these spans provides a comprehensive view of the code responsible for handling redirections and helps pinpoint the exact location where the fix is needed.
