The analysis of the search results identifies several key sections of code that are relevant to this issue:\n\n1. **SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects**: This method is central to the issue, as it handles the redirection logic. It copies the original request using `req.copy()` at the start of each iteration, which is the root cause of the method being incorrectly preserved.\n\n2. **Session class**: This class incorporates `SessionRedirectMixin` and is likely where the user interacts with the redirection handling. The method `Session.send` calls `self.resolve_redirects`, which is where the problematic redirection handling is initiated.\n\n3. **PreparedRequest.copy**: This method is responsible for copying the original request, which is used in `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`. Understanding how the request is copied is crucial for modifying the behavior to correctly handle redirection methods like POST to GET conversion and preserving methods across temporary redirects.\n\nThe identified code spans provide the foundation for understanding and potentially modifying the redirection handling to address the reported issue. Further analysis and modification of the `resolve_redirects` method, particularly the logic around copying and modifying the request, are necessary to fix the method selection issue during redirects.",
