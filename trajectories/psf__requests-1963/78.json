This method iterates through the redirection chain, preparing new requests based on the response status codes, and it is designed to handle the HTTP redirection process. The key part relevant to the issue is where the method updates the request method based on the status codes of the intermediate responses. It converts POST to GET for certain status codes and preserves the method for others. This is the exact part that needs to be adjusted or scrutinized to resolve the issue.
