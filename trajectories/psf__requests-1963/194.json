This can be particularly problematic when dealing with specific redirect status codes like 303 See Other, which should convert POST requests to GET but may inadvertently preserve the original method due to the copying behavior. The search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method, which is directly responsible for handling redirects in the Requests library. This method initializes a loop where it copies the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`) and modifies the request method based on the response status code. The relevant code spans are those handling the copying of the request, the method modification logic, and the overall loop structure. These parts align with the reported issue and are likely the points of interest for making any necessary changes to address the incorrect method selection problem. Therefore, the search task can be considered complete as the relevant code spans have been identified.",
