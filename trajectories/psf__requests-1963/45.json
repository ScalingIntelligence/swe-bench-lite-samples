This leads to incorrect method selection when certain HTTP status codes dictate a method change, such as 303 See Other, which should switch a POST to a GET. The reported issue suggests that the method should be updated based on the status code during each iteration of the redirection process rather than always copying the original request's method.\n\nUpon analyzing the provided code in `requests/sessions.py`, it is evident that the `resolve_redirects` method is indeed the central focus for addressing the reported issue. This method is responsible for handling redirections and, as mentioned, it starts each iteration by copying the original request object. This behavior matches the problem description, indicating that this code span is highly relevant.\n\nAdditionally, the broader context of the `Session` class and its integration with `SessionRedirectMixin` is crucial because it outlines how redirections are managed throughout the session. The `Session.prepare_request` and `Session.send` methods are also indirectly relevant as they contribute to the request preparation and sending process, which could be affected by the redirection handling.\n\nBased on the issue and the provided code, the identified code spans are very relevant to solving the described problem. The main focus should be on modifying the `resolve_redirects` method to correctly update the request method based on the response status code.",
