The problem arises because the original request object is copied for each redirection iteration, causing it to incorrectly preserve the original method (POST) rather than updating it according to the redirection responses (e.g., switching to GET after a 303 See Other response). To address this, we need to investigate the `resolve_redirects` method in the `requests/sessions.py` file and potentially related methods in the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py` to ensure method consistency across redirections.",

This is clearly demonstrated in the provided redirection chain, where a POST request turns into a GET due to a 303 status code, and then should be preserved as a GET after a 307 status code. However, because the original request is copied, the method reverts to POST, which is incorrect behavior.\n\nIn the search results, the key code spans are found in `requests/sessions.py` within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, specifically in the `resolve_redirects` method. This method handles the redirection logic and is where the issue is occurring. The line `prepared_request = req.copy()` is the root cause, as it copies the original request each time, leading to the method not being updated correctly based on the redirection status codes.\n\nAdditionally, relevant code spans can be found in the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py`, particularly in the `copy` method. This is where the copy of the original request is being prepared and manipulated. Understanding this class and method is crucial to finding a proper fix or workaround for the reported issue.\n\nThe search task is not complete, as while the relevant code spans for the issue have been identified, further investigation may be needed to determine the exact scope of changes required to fix the issue and to ensure that other parts of the redirection handling logic do not inadvertently cause similar problems.",
