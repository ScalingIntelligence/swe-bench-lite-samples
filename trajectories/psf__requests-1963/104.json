This is evident in the provided redirection chain example, where a POST request is converted to a GET after a 303 status, but a subsequent 307 status should preserve the GET method. However, because of the copied original request, a POST is issued instead.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are within the `requests/sessions.py` file, focusing on the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method. Here, the problematic line `prepared_request = req.copy()` initializes each iteration by copying the original request object, which leads to the preservation of the original method (e.g., POST) even after a redirect status suggests a method change (e.g., to GET for status 303). The subsequent code adjusts the method based on status codes but does so after already having copied the original request, which doesn't resolve the issue described.\n\nTherefore, the relevant code spans include the entire `resolve_redirects` method and the `PreparedRequest.copy` method in the `models.py` file, as the issue stems from how the original request is copied and how the method is then adjusted after certain status codes.",
