Specifically, when dealing with a redirection chain that includes status codes like 303 (See Other) and 307 (Temporary Redirect), the method should be adjusted according to the HTTP specification, but the current implementation incorrectly retains the original request's method. To address this, the search should focus on the `Session` class and specifically the `resolve_redirects` method within the `requests` package, as well as any related methods handling redirection logic. This includes looking at how the method is prepared in the `PreparedRequest` class and how requests are sent and handled in the `HTTPAdapter` and `HTTPConnectionPool` classes.",

Specifically, in a redirection chain, after a 303 See Other status code converts the POST method to GET, the subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET method, but the method reverts to POST because the original request is copied. The reported issue can be addressed by modifying the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. The provided code span shows the implementation of this method, which includes logic for handling different HTTP status codes and their effect on the request method during redirection. The method copies the original request at the start of the loop and then updates the URL and method based on the status code. This code span is directly related to the reported issue, as it demonstrates the problematic behavior described in the issue. Therefore, the identified code span is relevant.",
