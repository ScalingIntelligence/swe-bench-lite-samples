The issue specifically points out that when handling a series of redirects, the method incorrectly preserves the original request method, leading to incorrect method selection in subsequent requests. This problem is most evident when dealing with status codes like 303, which should change the request method to GET, but subsequent 307 status codes, which should preserve the method, do not because the original request method is copied each time.\n\nBased on this issue description, the key areas to focus on are:\n1. The `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class.\n2. The `copy` method in the `PreparedRequest` class, which is used to create a new request object in each iteration of `resolve_redirects`.\n3. The status code handling logic within `resolve_redirects` to ensure correct method selection based on the response.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans include:\n- `resolve_redirects` which contains the redirection logic and method handling.\n- `copy` method in `PreparedRequest` which is crucial for creating new request objects.\n\nThese spans directly address the issue by providing insight into how the redirection process and method preservation are implemented.",
