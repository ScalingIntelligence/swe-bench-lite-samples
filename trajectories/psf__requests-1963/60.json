The issue specifically mentions that the method should handle status codes like 303, 307, and others properly to ensure the correct method is used for subsequent requests. The provided search results and context helped in identifying the relevant code spans that deal with redirection handling and method selection within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. Since the issue is focused on the redirection process, reviewing the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method, along with the `Session` class and its methods that call `resolve_redirects`, provides a complete understanding of the code's redirection logic. The provided spans from `sessions.py` cover the key areas responsible for redirection handling, method selection, and the overall process flow of the `Session` class.",
