The example given shows a scenario where a 303 redirect should change the method to GET, but a subsequent 307 should preserve the GET method. However, due to the method copying, a POST is issued instead. From the provided context, the `Session` class and `SessionRedirectMixin` in `requests/sessions.py` are likely places to start the search for the `resolve_redirects` method. Also, since the issue involves the handling of different HTTP methods and redirects, it's relevant to look into `requests/models.py` for the `PreparedRequest` class and its methods, as well as `requests/adapters.py` for the `HTTPAdapter` class, which might handle some of the request lifecycle.",

It is crucial to ensure that the method does not preserve the original request method incorrectly across different redirection statuses like 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect. The identified code span is relevant because it directly addresses the issue by checking for specific redirection status codes and modifying the request method accordingly. It does not, however, have a systematic approach to handling all possible redirection scenarios effectively, leading to potential errors as reported. Additional code spans may need to be reviewed to ensure comprehensive handling of redirection sequences, but for now, this is the most pertinent code span related to the issue.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights the problem with `Session.resolve_redirects` copying the original request for all subsequent requests, which can cause incorrect method selection. This is particularly problematic in the context of HTTP redirects (like 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect) where the method should be adjusted appropriately but is not due to the original request being copied each time.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in `requests/sessions.py`. Specifically, the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` function is responsible for handling redirects and is where the issue likely resides. The code in this function copies the original request and does not adjust the method correctly in all scenarios. This includes handling the 303 status code by changing the method to GET without appropriately preserving the GET method for a subsequent 307 redirect.\n\nAdditionally, the `Session` and its method definitions such as `get`, `post`, etc., are relevant because they interact with the `resolve_redirects` method indirectly through the `request` method. These are important for understanding the complete context of how requests are handled by the session.\n\nLastly, the `PreparedRequest` class is included as it plays a role in the request preparation process, especially the `copy` method which is used within `resolve_redirects` to create a new request object. Understanding how `PreparedRequest` is handled is crucial for resolving the issue.\n\nTo address the issue, modifications will likely be needed within the `resolve_redirects` method to better handle the method selection during redirects. This might involve tracking the previous method or redirect status codes more carefully to avoid the incorrect method being used after a redirect.",
