This method starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which is consistent with the issue description. The code handles various HTTP status codes and appropriately changes the request method in certain conditions such as 303 See Other, 302 Found, and 301 Moved. However, the issue is that the method always starts with the original request's method, which may not align with the changes dictated by the redirection status codes.
