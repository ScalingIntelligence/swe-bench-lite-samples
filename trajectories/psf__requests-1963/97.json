Specifically, it mentions that in a redirection chain, the method should change from POST to GET after a 303 See Other response but should not change after a 307 Temporary Redirect response. However, the current implementation starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which leads to the incorrect preservation of the original request method. \n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in `requests/sessions.py` within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and in `requests/models.py` within the `PreparedRequest` class. The `resolve_redirects` method in `SessionRedirectMixin` is the primary focus as it deals with handling redirects and copying the original request. The `copy` method in the `PreparedRequest` class is also relevant as it is used to copy the request object during redirection handling. \n\nBy analyzing the code, the identified code spans directly relate to the description provided in the issue. These spans include the `resolve_redirects` method, where the logic for handling different redirect status codes and copying the original request are implemented. The `copy` method in `PreparedRequest` is also crucial as it is responsible for creating a copy of the request object that is used in the redirection process. \n\nBased on the analysis, these code spans are relevant to the reported issue, as they directly address the problem of incorrect method selection during redirects due to the copying of the original request object.",
