The example provided outlines that when a 303 response is followed by a 307, the method should change from POST to GET and then remain GET. However, due to the way `resolve_redirects` is implemented, it incorrectly uses the original request method (POST), even after the method should have changed to GET. To address this, we should focus the search on the `Session.resolve_redirects` method within the `requests/sessions.py` file, as this is where the redirection logic is handled. Additionally, considering the complexity of redirection handling, it might be beneficial to search the other relevant files and methods that are involved in the request and response handling process.",
