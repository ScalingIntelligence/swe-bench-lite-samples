The problem is that this method starts each iteration by copying the _original_ request object, which can lead to incorrect method selection following certain redirection status codes like 303 See Other. This behavior is explicitly shown in the `resolve_redirects` method where `prepared_request = req.copy()` is used at the beginning of the loop. This copying mechanism is further detailed in the `PreparedRequest` class within `requests/models.py`, specifically in the `copy` method, where a new `PreparedRequest` object is created and fields are copied from the original request. The relevance of these code spans is confirmed by the fact that they directly deal with the request object handling, method selection, and redirection logic as described in the issue.",
