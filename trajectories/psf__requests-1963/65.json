This behavior is explicitly seen in the `resolve_redirects` method where a `prepared_request` is created using `req.copy()`. The code within this method handles different HTTP status codes (like 303, 302, and 301) by potentially changing the request method to GET, but it does so without considering the specific behavior of other status codes like 307, which should preserve the method. This oversight can lead to incorrect method selection, particularly when encountering a chain of redirects that involve different status codes. The relevant code spans include the entire `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and the `copy` method within the `PreparedRequest` class, as the issue directly involves how requests are copied and modified during redirection handling.",
