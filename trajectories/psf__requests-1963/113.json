After analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the relevant code spans are within the `requests/sessions.py` file. The `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method is central to the issue, as it contains the logic for handling redirects and is where the original request is being copied. This method indeed checks for certain redirect status codes and modifies the method accordingly, but it always starts with a copy of the original request, which leads to the problem described. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method in `requests/models.py` is relevant because it is responsible for creating the copy of the request object that is used in the redirection process. Identifying these code spans helps in pinpointing exactly where the change needs to be made to ensure that the method selection is handled correctly during redirects.",
