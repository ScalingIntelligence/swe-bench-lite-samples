The issue is that the `Session.resolve_redirects` method always starts by copying the original request object, which can inadvertently preserve the original request method even when it should change according to the HTTP status code (e.g., converting POST to GET on a 303 status code). This behavior is evident in the provided `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method where the `req` (original request) is copied at the beginning of the while loop. Consequently, any method changes based on the status codes (like 303) won't have the intended effect because the method assignment happens after copying the original request object. This could be addressed by adjusting the order of operations in handle_redirects method, potentially assigning the method based on the status code before copying the original request.",

There is code that attempts to modify the method based on the redirect status code, such as setting to 'GET' for 303. However, the handling of the 307 status code seems incomplete as it does not explicitly preserve the method, which could be a potential source of the issue.
