Based on the provided files, it's clear that the `SessionRedirectMixin` and `Session` class in `sessions.py` are likely to contain the relevant code. Additionally, the `PoolManager` in `poolmanager.py` and the `HTTPConnectionPool` in `connectionpool.py` could also be involved in handling redirection. Therefore, focusing on these classes and methods would be the most effective approach to find the code causing the bug.",

This can lead to the original request method being used instead of the appropriate one for the redirection (e.g., issuing a POST instead of a GET after a 303 redirect).\n\nThe search results provide the `SessionRedirectMixin` class which includes the `resolve_redirects` method. This method contains the logic for handling redirects and is where the issue is likely occurring. Specifically, the line `prepared_request = req.copy()` indicates where the original request is being copied for each iteration, which does not account for changes in the request method due to certain redirect status codes. This method handles the copying of the original request and the subsequent processing of the request method based on the redirect status code.\n\nGiven the detailed description of the issue, it is clear that the reported problem directly relates to the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. This method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the request method based on the HTTP status code of the redirect response, especially when encountering status codes like 303. The other files and spans in the search results, though related to HTTP request handling and connection pooling, do not directly address the specific problem described in the issue.",
