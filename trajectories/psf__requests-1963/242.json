This is especially problematic in redirection chains where HTTP status codes like 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect should modify or preserve the request method but do not because the original request method is being copied. The search results provide detailed code spans that are highly relevant to the issue: \n\n1. The `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method in `requests/sessions.py` shows the implementation of the redirection logic. It involves copying the original request and modifying the method based on the response status code. This is the exact code block that needs to be reviewed and potentially fixed.\n\n2. In `requests/models.py`, the `Request.prepare` and `PreparedRequest.copy` methods are relevant as they handle the preparation and copying of requests. Since the issue is about the copying of the original request, these methods are crucial for understanding and fixing the problem.\n\nOverall, these code spans directly address the reported issue, providing the necessary context to understand and fix the problem with method selection during redirection handling.",

Upon analyzing the provided file context, specifically in `requests/sessions.py`, it is evident that the existing code within the `resolve_redirects` method partially addresses this by checking certain redirect status codes and setting the method accordingly (e.g., converting POST to GET on status code 303). However, the specific issue mentioned, where a 307 redirect after a 303 should preserve the GET method but ends up reverting to the original POST, is not directly addressed in the provided code. This indicates an incomplete implementation for handling all the nuances of HTTP redirect behavior.

This behavior is observed in the provided code span for `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`. The issue specifically mentions that after a 303 See Other redirect, the method should convert a POST to a GET, but if another redirect (like 307 Temporary Redirect) occurs, it should preserve the GET method. However, the current implementation always starts by copying the original request object, which leads to the original method being used for subsequent redirects, potentially causing incorrect method selection. The code spans provided in the search results confirm this behavior and also show the method `PreparedRequest.copy` which is used in the `resolve_redirects` method to copy the original request. This indicates that the identified code is directly relevant to addressing the reported issue. The search task can be considered complete as the relevant portions of the codebase have been identified.",
