Specifically, the method copies the original request in each iteration of the redirection loop, which can cause the original method (like POST) to persist despite redirection status codes indicating a method change (like 303 See Other to GET). The provided search results include the `resolve_redirects` method which is critical for handling redirections. Within this method, the original request object is copied using `req.copy()`. This is where the potential issue lies, especially in how it handles different HTTP status codes like 303 or 307, which dictate method changes. Additionally, the `copy` method within the `PreparedRequest` class is directly related, as it is used to create a new `PreparedRequest` object based on the original request. This copy method doesn't account for the specific redirection status codes that could affect the method type. The provided code spans directly relate to the reported issue by outlining how requests are copied and handled during redirection, which could be problematic due to the persistence of the original method type. Therefore, I have identified both the `resolve_redirects` and `copy` methods as highly relevant to address the reported issue, as these methods directly control how requests are processed and copied during redirects.",

To maintain the request method during a 307 redirection, we need to ensure that we do not overwrite the method during the iteration when a 307 status is encountered. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method in `requests/models.py` is used, but it does not differentiate between different status codes during redirection. By explicitly checking for the 307 status code and preserving the method in such cases, we can resolve the issue of incorrect method selection during redirection chains.",

The provided search results, including the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method in `requests/sessions.py`, closely relate to the reported issue.
