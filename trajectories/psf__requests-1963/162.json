The issue points out that due to the copying of the original request object, during each iteration, the method might not be correctly updated according to HTTP redirection status codes like 303 See Other or 307 Temporary Redirect. This causes incorrect method selection, leading to a POST request being issued instead of a GET in certain redirection scenarios. The relevant code spans from the search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method in `sessions.py`, which handles the redirection logic, and the `PreparedRequest.copy` method in `models.py`, which is responsible for copying the request object. These spans are critical as they directly address the issue of how the request method is maintained or altered during the redirection process. By analyzing these spans, we can clearly see the logic responsible for copying the request and adjusting the method based on the status code, which is central to fixing the reported issue.",
