            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue focuses on how `Session.resolve_redirects` behaves with redirection chains, particularly with HTTP status codes 303 and 307. This behavior involves handling the method (POST or GET) across different redirections. Given this context, it's clear that the most relevant part of the code is where the redirection logic is handled, specifically in the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. In this method, the original request is copied for each iteration, which is the main concern mentioned in the issue. This copying can lead to the incorrect method being selected, as the original request's method is copied instead of the changed method (e.g., a POST being copied when subsequent redirects should maintain the GET, following a 303 See Other status code). Therefore, the focus should be on modifying or extending this method to ensure that it respects the method changes indicated by the status codes during a redirection chain. Additionally, understanding the broader context within which `resolve_redirects` operates, such as how requests are prepared and sent, helps in shaping a comprehensive solution. Thus, other methods like `prepare_request` and `send` in the Session class, along with `copy` and `prepare` methods in the PreparedRequest class, are indirectly relevant as they set up or manage request objects that `resolve_redirects` works with. They provide a framework for how the requests are handled, prepared, and processed, which is necessary background to fully understand and address the issue at hand.",
