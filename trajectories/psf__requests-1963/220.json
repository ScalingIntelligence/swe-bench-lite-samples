To address this, I need to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle request preparation and redirection, focusing on where the original request is replicated instead of modifying the request based on the redirect response status code. In the provided search results, I found relevant code spans in `requests/models.py`, `requests/packages/urllib3/request.py`, and `requests/sessions.py`. In `requests/models.py`, the `PreparedRequest` class and its methods (`prepare`, `__init__`) are responsible for preparing a request, which might be getting reset or incorrectly reused in redirection scenarios. In `requests/packages/urllib3/request.py`, the `RequestMethods` class deals with methods like `request` and `urlopen`, which are essential for handling different HTTP methods correctly, hinting at potential issues with method handling during redirects. Finally, in `requests/sessions.py`, the `Session` class and its method `request` initialize and send requests, which is central to how redirects are managed. These sections are crucial as they directly affect how methods and URLs are handled during redirection, which aligns closely with the reported issue.",

Therefore, the critical part of the codebase related to this issue has been identified in the provided context. The `PreparedRequest` class and its `copy` method are also relevant as they are involved in the request preparation and duplication process. Additionally, the `RequestMethods` class from `urllib3` suggests a lower-level handling of request methods, which could be further investigated to ensure comprehensive understanding.
