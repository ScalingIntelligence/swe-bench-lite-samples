This is particularly problematic when handling 303 and 307 redirect status codes, which should respectively change POST methods to GET and preserve the original method. The key code spans identified that are directly relevant include the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method where the problematic copy of the original request occurs and the method selection logic that may not be preserving the correct HTTP method for 307 redirects. Further, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method is examined as it is central to how the original request is being replicated, potentially without considering updates to the method type necessary after encountering certain redirect status codes. These code spans are critical for understanding and potentially fixing the issue described.",
