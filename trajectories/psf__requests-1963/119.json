Specifically, after a 303 See Other redirection that converts a POST to a GET, a subsequent 307 Temporary Redirect should preserve the GET method. However, due to the copying of the original request, Requests may mistakenly issue a POST. To address this, it's crucial to locate the specific function or method where this behavior occurs. Relevant files and methods to investigate include `Session.resolve_redirects` in `requests/sessions.py` and potentially any related methods or classes handling HTTP redirection in the `requests` library.",

However, the method does not handle the preservation of the method correctly after a 303 redirect followed by a 307 Temporary Redirect, which is the specific scenario the issue describes.
