The method then handles various HTTP status codes and adjusts the request method accordingly, but the copying of the original request could cause it to default to the original method, leading to incorrect handling of redirects.\n\nThe identified code carefully handles different types of redirects and adjusts the method to 'GET' for certain status codes, but the issue lies in the initial copying of the original request, which may override these adjustments.

Specifically: for a 303 See Other redirect (status code 303), the method should always update to 'GET' unless the original method was 'HEAD'. For a 302 Found redirect (status code 302), the method should also update to 'GET' unless the original method was 'HEAD', but this is generally deprecated behavior based on modern interpretations of the HTTP/1.1 specification. For a 307 Temporary Redirect (status code 307), the method should preserve the current request's method unless the original method was 'HEAD'. Remove any logic that references the original request's method for determining the method to use in subsequent requests.\n\nThe instructions require updating the handling of specific HTTP redirect status codes within the `resolve_redirects` method. The modifications needed are based on the redirect status codes (303, 302, and 307), and they should ensure that the method does not revert to the original request's method unless it is 'HEAD'. The changes involve updating the method to 'GET' for 303 and 302 unless the original method was 'HEAD', and preserving the method for 307 unless the original method was 'HEAD'. The code lines that need to be updated are those that handle these specific status codes.",
