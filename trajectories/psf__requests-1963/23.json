The issue describes that the method incorrectly copies the original request for all subsequent requests, which can lead to incorrect method selection during redirects. In the provided search results, the `requests/sessions.py` file contains the relevant code. I identified the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class where the issue likely occurs. The key part of the issue, 'the subsequent 307 should preserve the GET', is relevant to the section of code where redirection logic is handled, specifically where the method is reassigned based on the status code. The code span that includes the method definition and the logic for handling the method based on the status code seems to be the most relevant part.
