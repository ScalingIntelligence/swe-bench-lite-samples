This is particularly problematic when dealing with status codes like 303, 307, and 302 that dictate specific method behaviors but are not consistently handled. Examining the provided code, we can see that `Session.resolve_redirects` indeed starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which can result in the same method being used for a redirect regardless of the status code. This method needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the method based on the redirection status code. The search results include several key sections related to this functionality. `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` is particularly relevant as it directly handles the logic of redirect resolution, including method handling based on status code. The `Session` class also contains related methods such as `send` and `prepare_request` which could potentially need adjustments to better handle method preservation or switching as dictated by redirection status codes.",
