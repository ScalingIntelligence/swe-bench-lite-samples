To address this, we need to specifically look into the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class (which is part of the `Session` class) in the `sessions.py` file, as well as any methods related to handling request methods such as `request`, `get`, `post`, etc., in the `Session` class. Additionally, checking the `PreparedRequest` class in `models.py` for how request methods are prepared and copied might also be relevant. Since other files contain related functionalities (like `urlopen` methods in `poolmanager.py` and `connectionpool.py`, and `HTTPAdapter` class in `adapters.py` handling HTTP requests), they could provide a more comprehensive context of the redirection process.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of `Session.resolve_redirects` method, specifically how it handles method selection during redirection. It is mentioned that `Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which can cause it to issue an incorrect request method (e.g., POST instead of GET) when dealing with certain redirect status codes like 303 See Other and 307 Temporary Redirect.\n\nThe primary focus in the search results is on the `SessionRedirectMixin` class and its `resolve_redirects` method. This method contains the logic for handling redirects, including the line `prepared_request = req.copy()`, which suggests that the issue described in the reported problem could stem from this behavior. Other parts of the code set the method to 'GET' under certain conditions but do not prevent the incorrect method from being used if it was set from the original request.\n\nAdditionally, the `PreparedRequest` class, which is used in the `resolve_redirects` method, also contains a `copy` method that is likely involved in the issue. Understanding how this copying behavior affects the method selection during redirection is crucial.\n\nOverall, the search results seem to be relevant to the reported issue, particularly the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method and the `PreparedRequest` class's handling of request copying. Further analysis might involve simulating the redirection scenarios described in the issue within the `resolve_redirects` method to verify if the current code can handle them correctly.",

This behavior is observed in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class within `sessions.py`. The method logic checks for specific status codes (like 303 See Other) and appropriately changes the method to `GET` as needed. However, it maintains the original method for other status codes, which can be problematic. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest` class in `models.py` contains the `copy` method that is crucial for the redirection process. Although the context provided focuses on the `sessions.py` and `models.py` files, it does not cover the interaction with other external modules like `adapters.py`, `poolmanager.py`, or `connectionpool.py`. These could provide additional insight into how the redirection behavior is managed across the project.",

This behavior causes the method to remain unchanged even when it should be adjusted according to HTTP redirection status codes (e.g., a 303 status code should change a POST to a GET).
