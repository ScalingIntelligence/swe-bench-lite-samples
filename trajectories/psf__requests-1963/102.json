This results in the incorrect method being used for subsequent requests, which should be corrected by preserving the method type across redirects unless explicitly changed by a redirect status code like 303. The search results provided contain the relevant code spans, including the `resolve_redirects` method itself within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, which is inherited by the `Session` class. This method is responsible for handling the redirection logic, including the problematic behavior where it incorrectly uses the original request method for all subsequent requests. The code spans also include the `Session` class definition, which initializes the session with default values and provides the `send` method, which calls the `resolve_redirects` method. This context provides a clear picture of how the redirection handling is implemented and should be sufficient to address the reported issue.",
