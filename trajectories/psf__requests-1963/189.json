This method is responsible for managing the redirection process, including copying the original request and selecting the appropriate method based on the redirection status codes. The code demonstrates an attempt to handle different redirection status codes such as 303, 302, and 301 by adjusting the request method accordingly. However, it seems that the method might not always correctly update the request method, especially when dealing with intermediate redirects that change the method from POST to GET and then encountering a 307 status code that should preserve the GET method. This discrepancy could lead to the bug described in the issue. Although the core logic to handle redirects is present in the provided code, more specific unit tests or additional code points might be required to fully confirm the absence of bugs in this area. Nevertheless, the provided code is highly relevant to the issue, and the main logic related to the change of request methods during redirects is addressed, indicating that the file context is quite relevant to the issue at hand.",
