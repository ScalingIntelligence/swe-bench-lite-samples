The search results contain relevant code spans in `requests/sessions.py` and `requests/models.py` that are directly related to handling redirects and preparing requests. In `sessions.py`, the `resolve_redirects` method is defined within `SessionRedirectMixin`, which handles the logic for resolving redirects, including the part where it copies the original request using `req.copy()`. This method should be modified to ensure it does not always use the original request's method for subsequent redirects. Additionally, the `copy` method in `models.py` defines how a `PreparedRequest` is copied, which is crucial for understanding how the original request is being replicated for each redirect iteration. These code spans are highly relevant to addressing the issue of incorrect method selection during redirection handling.",
