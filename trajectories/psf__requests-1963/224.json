The issue described in the report aligns well with the code logic inside this function. It starts by copying the original request (`prepared_request = req.copy()`), which is the root cause of the problem when dealing with redirect status codes like 303, 307, etc. This function then handles various status codes like 303 ('see_other'), 307 ('temporary'), where it attempts to switch the method to GET or preserve the original method, but fails due to the copying of the original request at the start of each iteration.",
