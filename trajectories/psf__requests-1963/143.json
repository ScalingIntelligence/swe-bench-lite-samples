The issue highlighted seems to suggest that the method preservation fails under certain conditions, particularly when handling a chain of redirects involving 303 followed by 307. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest.copy` method is responsible for copying the original request, which might also need attention if the copying process does not adequately preserve essential attributes for method handling. Further investigation into how the method attribute is managed and copied during redirection scenarios is advisable to address the issue. Also, it would be beneficial to examine or develop additional tests that specifically target the handling of method preservation across different redirect scenarios to ensure robustness and correctness.",

Given the context provided in `requests/sessions.py`, where `Session.resolve_redirects` handles the redirection logic, it's crucial to ensure that the method is being correctly set and preserved during different types of redirects, especially those involving 303 (See Other) and 307 (Temporary Redirect) status codes. The `PreparedRequest.copy` method's role in duplicating the request for redirection also needs careful attention, as any inaccuracies in this method could lead to the method not being preserved correctly. Additional investigation into how the `PreparedRequest` class interacts with the `Session` class during redirection could provide further insights into how to address the issue.",

The key concern is that the original request method is being copied for each redirection iteration, which can result in incorrect method selection. Specifically, if a 303 See Other response is encountered, the method should be switched to GET, and subsequent redirects should preserve this method. However, the current implementation uses the original request method, which is incorrect for certain status codes like 307. The provided search results show relevant methods and classes, including the `Session` class and its methods (`get`, `post`, etc.), the `SessionRedirectMixin` class with the `resolve_redirects` method, and the `PreparedRequest` class with its `copy` and other preparation methods. These are all directly related to handling requests, their preparation, and redirection, thus addressing the issue reported. The initial file context also confirms the relevance of these parts of the codebase to the reported issue.",

It involves processing different HTTP status codes like 303 (See Other) and 307 (Temporary Redirect), adjusting the method as needed for certain codes, and copying the original request for each redirection iteration. However, the logic for method preservation seems to be scattered and may not cover all edge cases, especially when dealing with a chain of redirections involving different types of status codes. Specifically, the handling of the method may not be consistently preserving its original state after encountering a 303 status code followed by a 307 status code, as indicated by the issue. Exploration into additional methods like `copy` in the `PreparedRequest` class and further refinement of the redirection logic within `resolve_redirects` is recommended to ensure the HTTP method is correctly preserved across different redirection scenarios.",

However, these methods are part of the request preparation process and do not directly relate to the issue concerning redirection handling.\n\nGiven the detailed context provided in the reported issue and the currently identified code spans, it appears that the relevant code spans have already been identified in the `sessions.py` file. There is no need to search further as the existing context and the provided search results match the issue description and reveal no additional code spans that would lead to an enhancement or resolution of the issue.",
