Analyzing the provided search results, I've identified the relevant code spans.\n\n- The `SessionRedirectMixin` class contains the `resolve_redirects` method, which is responsible for handling redirection logic. The method copies the original request using `req.copy()` and then modifies the method based on the HTTP status code received, such as converting POST to GET for status codes like 303. This current logic does not consider preserving the method for subsequent redirects like 307, which directs the method to be preserved.\n\n- The `PreparedRequest` class is also relevant as it includes the `copy` method that `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` relies on to create new request objects for redirects. Understanding how `PreparedRequest.copy()` behaves is crucial for diagnosing why the method selection does not adhere to the HTTP specification in this case.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified code spans are directly related to the problem described in the reported issue, providing a clear starting point for understanding and fixing the incorrect method selection issue during redirects.",
