This can cause a POST request to be incorrectly issued after a 303 See Other redirect, which should convert a POST to a GET. The search results reveal the implementation of `resolve_redirects` in `requests/sessions.py`, which starts each iteration by copying the original request object, which could be the source of the issue. The code shows how it handles various redirect status codes, including 303, but it overlooks the preservation of the method for subsequent 307 redirects. Additionally, the `PreparedRequest` class in `requests/models.py` is likely relevant for understanding how the request objects are being prepared and possibly modified throughout the redirection process.",
