The provided search results include the `SessionRedirectMixin` class which contains the `resolve_redirects` method. This method is relevant to the issue as it outlines the process of handling redirects, including copying the original request, modifying the request URL, and handling the method based on the redirect status code (e.g., changing a POST to GET for a 303 status). The method's logic to copy the original request at the start of each iteration is central to the issue, as it prevents the method from correctly updating to subsequent GET requests after an initial 303 redirect. Therefore, the code span of the `resolve_redirects` method is highly relevant to the reported issue.",
