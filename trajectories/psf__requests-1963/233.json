Upon examining the search results, the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class seems directly related to the issue. Specifically, the method copies the original request at the start of each redirection loop, which leads to the incorrect method being used for subsequent requests. The code span includes logic to handle different redirection status codes, such as 303 See Other, but the method assignment logic appears to need adjustment to better handle preserving the correct method after redirects like 307 Temporary Redirect.
