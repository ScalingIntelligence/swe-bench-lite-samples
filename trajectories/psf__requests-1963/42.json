To address this, I need to find the relevant parts of the codebase that specifically handle request copying and method selection during the redirect resolution process. In the provided search results, I found several key code spans that are relevant to the issue:\n\n1. The `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method contains the logic for handling redirects, including copying the original request and adjusting the request method based on the HTTP status code of the response.\n\n2. Within the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method, the lines that handle copying the original request to a new `PreparedRequest` object are crucial for understanding how the original request's method is preserved or changed.\n\n3. The `PreparedRequest.copy` method is responsible for creating a copy of the `PreparedRequest` object. This method is likely relevant as the copying of the original request during redirects happens through this mechanism.\n\nGiven these findings, the identified code spans seem to be relevant to the reported issue, as they directly involve the handling and copying of requests during the redirect resolution process. Therefore, I will include these spans in the `identified_spans` field.",
