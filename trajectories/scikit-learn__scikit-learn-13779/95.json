The error occurs because there is no check for an estimator being `None` when `sample_weight` support is being checked. Upon reviewing the provided code, the relevant section is the `fit` method of the `_BaseVoting` class where the `sample_weight` parameter is handled. Specifically, the code should include a check for `None` estimators before attempting to use them in the `Parallel` call. The `fit` method of `VotingClassifier` also calls the `fit` method of `_BaseVoting`, so any changes in `_BaseVoting` should be considered. The identified code spans include the entire `_BaseVoting.fit` method and the `VotingClassifier.fit` method, which are crucial for addressing the issue. These methods currently do not check for `None` estimators when `sample_weight` is provided, which leads to the error.
