This points towards insufficient checks within the `fit` method of the `VotingClassifier` to handle `None` estimators when sample weights are provided. Searching within the `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py` file for the `VotingClassifier` class and the `fit` method implementation should reveal why the check is missing.

It should include a check for None estimators before attempting to fit them with sample weights.\n2. The `set_params` method in the `_BaseVoting` class, which allows setting individual estimators to None.
