The error trace points to an AttributeError due to accessing 'fit' on a NoneType object. This suggests that there should be a check within the fit method of VotingClassifier to ensure that the estimator is not None before attempting to call 'fit'. Since the error occurs specifically with sample weights, the search should focus on the fit method of VotingClassifier within the 'sklearn/ensemble/voting.py' file, particularly in relation to the handling of sample_weight. The method signature and usage of sample_weight in the fit method need to be examined and possibly adjusted.",

The main areas of concern are the `fit` methods within the `VotingClassifier` and `_BaseVoting` classes, as well as the handling of `estimators` and `sample_weight`. The provided code spans include the `fit` methods for both `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier`, which are directly relevant to the issue. The `_BaseVoting.fit` method handles the validation of `estimators` and `sample_weight`, while the `VotingClassifier.fit` method specifically deals with classification tasks, including the handling of `sample_weight`. The missing check for an estimator being `None` before attempting to fit it with `sample_weight` is a clear candidate for the error. Therefore, the identified spans are those related to the `fit` methods in both `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier`, as they manage the core logic of the issue.",

This is due to the lack of a check for `None` estimators before attempting to call their `fit` methods. The current file context already shows relevant code spans in `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` classes, particularly the `fit` method in both. The new search results provide additional methods (`set_params` and `get_params`) that are related to managing the state of the estimators. Although these methods do not directly handle the `fit` issue, they are crucial components for handling parameters, which can influence the behavior during `fit`. This broader context helps in understanding how modifications or additional checks in these parameter-handling methods could potentially prevent the issue when an estimator is set to `None` during `fit` with `sample_weight`. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue, and the search task can be considered complete.",
