The issue indicates a problem when setting an estimator to None, yet the context lacks the details of how set_params method handles None values or how it interacts with fit when sample weights are involved. Therefore, while the fit method in the context handles sample weights, the absence of a comprehensive set_params method prevents us from determining if the relevant code for the issue is fully covered. Additionally, the set_params method shown does not contain the necessary checks for None values that would prevent the AttributeError mentioned in the issue.",
