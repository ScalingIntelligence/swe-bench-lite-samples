The current implementation checks if all estimators are None but does not explicitly check for individual estimators being None during the fit process when sample weights are provided. This suggests that the relevant code to address the issue is present but is incomplete, as it does not fully prevent the 'NoneType' AttributeError from occurring in the scenario described.

However, the specific issue of a `NoneType` estimator not being handled explicitly is where the problem lies. The current logic checks for `estimators` being `None` at the beginning, but it doesn't account for individual estimators being `None` after initialization. The relevant part of the code to focus on is the `fit` method where the parallel fitting of estimators occurs and where `sample_weight` is managed. To resolve this, we need to explicitly check for `None` before attempting to fit each estimator. This validation should ideally be placed within the `_parallel_fit_estimator` function or within the loop where the fitting is parallelized to ensure that a `None` estimator does not attempt to invoke the `fit` method.",

From the provided context and search results, the relevant sections of code are primarily within the VotingClassifier and _BaseVoting classes, specifically focusing on the fit method. The current implementation does check for None estimators but does not handle them gracefully when sample weights are also provided. The key sections involved are _BaseVoting.fit and VotingClassifier.fit. The _parallel_fit_estimator function is also relevant as it handles the fitting of individual estimators with sample weights. To fix the issue, modifications should be made to these sections to ensure that None estimators are filtered out before attempting to fit or check for sample weight support.
