This error is likely due to the lack of a check for `None` estimators within the `fit` method when `sample_weight` is provided. Upon analyzing the provided code spans, it's evident that the `fit` method in the `_BaseVoting` class and overridden in `VotingClassifier` does not account for estimators being `None`. Instead, it directly checks the length and validity of the estimators without ensuring that they are not `None`. This oversight can lead to the scenario described in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this are across the `_BaseVoting.fit`, `VotingClassifier.fit`, and initialization parts. These sections clearly show the instantiation of estimators and the core logic for fitting, including the handling of `sample_weight`. Modifying these parts to include a check for `None` estimators before attempting to fit would likely resolve the issue. Additionally, the initialization section provides context for how estimators are set up and thus could be potentially involved if modifications are required to the estimator list post-initialization (though this specific point is not explicitly addressed in the issue but is contextually relevant).",

This issue can be addressed by adding a check for None estimators within the fit method before attempting to fit them with sample weights. The provided file context and search results contain pertinent sections of the code in question: specifically, the fit method in the _BaseVoting class and the VotingClassifier class. These methods currently do not check for None estimators before invoking the fit method with sample weights, which directly corresponds to the reported issue. The current implementation of the fit method in _BaseVoting identifies and excludes None estimators from the parallel fitting process but only after initializing the process. Therefore, the relevant code span to address the issue involves the fit method where the None check should be implemented prior to the parallel fitting process.
