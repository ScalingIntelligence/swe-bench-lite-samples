The error occurs in the `fit` method due to a NoneType estimator. To address this, we need to identify the relevant sections of code responsible for handling estimators and sample weights during the fit process. By examining the provided search results from 'sklearn/ensemble/voting.py', we can see several relevant spans of code. The `_BaseVoting.fit` method and its sub-methods like `_parallel_fit_estimator` handle the fitting of estimators with sample weights. They iterate through the estimators, checking if they are not None and fitting them with the provided sample weights. The issue seems to be that while the code checks for None estimators to prevent all being None, it does not specifically handle a case where an individual estimator becomes None after initialization (e.g., through `set_params`). Therefore, the identified spans are likely relevant and necessary to implement a fix for the reported issue.",

To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the fitting process and setting parameters. In the provided search results, we find the `_BaseVoting` class and its `fit` method which is responsible for fitting the estimators. Here, there is a check for `None` estimators but it does not account for the presence of sample weights. We also find the `set_params` method which is used to set the parameters of the estimators, potentially to `None`.
