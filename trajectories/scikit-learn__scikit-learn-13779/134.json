The _BaseVoting class contains the fit method, which checks the validity of estimators and their compatibility with sample weights. The VotingClassifier class inherits from _BaseVoting and has additional checks and transformations specific to classification tasks.\n\nThe relevant spans are those that deal directly with fitting the estimators, setting parameters, and handling sample weights.
