This suggests that the code does not properly check if an estimator is None before attempting to call its 'fit' method, especially when sample weights are provided. To resolve this, it's necessary to locate where the fit method of the VotingClassifier handles sample weights and ensure that it checks for None estimators.

The issue suggests that there is no check for an estimator being None within the sample_weight support, leading to the AttributeError when trying to call fit on a NoneType object. The provided code spans include the VotingClassifier definition, its __init__ method where estimators are initialized, and the fit method where the error occurs.

To find the exact location handling 'sample_weight' and check for None estimators, further inspection into the '_BaseVoting' or '_BaseComposition' methods or subclasses that handle the iteration and fitting of estimators is necessary.

This is due to the lack of a check for None estimators in the sample_weight support. I will analyze the code to identify the relevant parts that handle fitting with sample weights and the management of estimators. The issue suggests that there is a need to modify the fit method to handle None estimators gracefully when weights are provided. The provided code spans include the initialization of the VotingClassifier, the fit method, and the handling of estimators and weights. Specifically, the fit method needs to be modified to check for None estimators and handle them appropriately when sample weights are provided. The _BaseVoting.fit method seems to be the critical part to modify as it is the base implementation for fitting the estimators. Additionally, the VotingClassifier.fit method inherits and implements this behavior. I will ensure that these methods are covered and that the modifications will prevent the failure when an estimator is None and weights are present. This requires careful consideration of how the Parallel fitting process is managed to exclude None estimators correctly.",
