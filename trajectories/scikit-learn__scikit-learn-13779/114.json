This occurs because there is no explicit check for None estimators when sample_weight is supported in the fit method. Currently, the fit method in the _BaseVoting class and the VotingClassifier class does not handle the case where an estimator is None. The existing code checks for the presence of sample_weight in each estimator but does not check if the estimator itself is None. This results in a NoneType error when trying to fit with a None estimator. To address this, we need to enhance the fit method to check for None estimators and handle them appropriately.

Other relevant code sections include the initialization of the VotingClassifier and the definition of _BaseVoting class that includes abstract methods and parameter setting functionalities.
