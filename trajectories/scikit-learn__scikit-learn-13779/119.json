The key elements to focus on are the handling of sample weights and the checking for None estimators. The search results reveal relevant code sections in the sklearn/ensemble/voting.py file, notably the _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier classes. These classes include the fit method and handle the estimators and weights. Specifically, the _BaseVoting.fit method checks for the number of estimators and their compatibility with sample weights, but it lacks a check for None-type estimators when sample weights are provided. The VotingClassifier.fit method inherits and uses the fit method from _BaseVoting, which indicates that this is the relevant place to implement the fix for checking None-type estimators when sample weights are present.",
