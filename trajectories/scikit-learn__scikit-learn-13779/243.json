These methods currently check for None estimators and handle sample weights, but there seems to be a gap in handling the scenario where a previously set estimator is set to None after initialization (as indicated by the 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fit'' error in the issue).\n\nTo address this, the code spans related to the fit method and the handling of estimators need to be addressed, specifically looking for places where a None check might be missing or insufficient. The set_params method, which is used to update the estimators, also needs to be reviewed to ensure it properly handles setting an estimator to None.",
