The current context and search results highlight the relevant parts of the VotingClassifier and _BaseVoting classes, which handle the initialization, fitting, and parameter setting for the ensemble of classifiers. The main points revolve around checking if estimators are None and handling sample weights. The fit method in VotingClassifier inherits from _BaseVoting but does not explicitly handle cases where one of the estimators can be None. The search results provide additional context for the _BaseVoting class, showing that it already has mechanisms to validate estimators and weights. However, it does not check specifically for a None estimator when sample weights are provided, which is the crux of the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that directly handle or relate to the None estimator scenario and sample weight handling in the fit method.",
