The key steps in identifying relevant code spans are: 1. Check if the `fit` method for `VotingClassifier` correctly handles the case where an estimator is `None`. 2. Verify if the `sample_weight` parameter is appropriately managed when an estimator is `None`. 3. Ensure that the fit method does not attempt to call `fit` on a `None` estimator. Based on these criteria, I analyzed the `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py` file and found that the `fit` method in the `_BaseVoting` class and the `VotingClassifier` class are crucial. Specifically, the code in the `_BaseVoting.fit` method checks for `None` estimators but does not handle the case where an estimator is set to `None` after initialization. This is where the issue arises. The relevant code spans include the `_BaseVoting.fit` method and the `VotingClassifier.fit` method. Additionally, the `VotingClassifier.__init__` method should also be considered as it initializes the estimators that could potentially be set to `None` later.",
