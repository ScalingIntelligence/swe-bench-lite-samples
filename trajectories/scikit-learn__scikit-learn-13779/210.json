The error message 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fit'' suggests that the code doesn't handle the case where an estimator is None before attempting to call 'fit' on it. To address this, we need to find the specific part of the code where the estimator is checked or accessed during the 'fit' method and ensure there's a check for None before attempting to call 'fit'. Given the context provided, focusing on the 'VotingClassifier' class specifically in 'voting.py' with a query related to handling None estimators appears most relevant.",

The provided search results contain multiple spans from the `VotingClassifier` class, including the `fit` method. The `fit` method in `_BaseVoting` checks for the length of `estimators` and whether any of them are `None`, but it does not explicitly check if an individual estimator is `None` when `sample_weight` is provided. This omission could lead to the `AttributeError` described in the issue. The `VotingClassifier.fit` method inherits from `_BaseVoting.fit` and adds additional checks for `voting` type and label encoding. Reviewing these methods suggests that the code does not directly address the scenario where an estimator is set to `None` during the fit process with sample weights. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue would be those in the `_BaseVoting.fit` method where estimators are iterated over and fitted.",
