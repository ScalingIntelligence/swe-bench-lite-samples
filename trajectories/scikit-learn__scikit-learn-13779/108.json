I analyzed the search results and found several relevant code spans. The 'VotingClassifier.fit' span directly addresses the fit method, which includes logic for handling sample weights and checking the voting strategy, but it does not explicitly check if an estimator is None. The '_BaseVoting.fit' span contains the broader fit logic that iterates over estimators and checks if they support sample weights. It also handles the cloning and fitting of estimators in parallel, but it does not explicitly check for None in the fit loop itself. The '_BaseVoting.set_params' span is also relevant as it handles setting parameters, which might assign None to estimators, and could be the source of the issue when retried with fit. Since the issue is about handling None estimators during fit, the primary focus should be on checking for None within the fit method, which is partially addressed in '_BaseVoting.fit' but not thoroughly enough to prevent the reported error. Modifying '_BaseVoting.fit' to include an explicit check for None estimators before attempting to fit them should resolve the issue.",
