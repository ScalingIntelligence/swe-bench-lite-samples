The search results include multiple spans, but the critical ones are likely to be within the `fit` methods of `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier`, which deal explicitly with estimators and optional sample weights. Additionally, the location of errors and Nones is pertinent, given the reported error. After analyzing, I focus on the sections within the `fit` methods in `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` that address checking for None estimators and sample weight compatibility.",

Thus, if an estimator is set to None after initialization (as in the issue's example), the current fit method in _BaseVoting would not handle it appropriately and would raise an AttributeError.
