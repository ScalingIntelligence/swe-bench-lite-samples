The error message indicates that the fit method is encountering a 'NoneType' object, which means it's trying to call fit on an estimator that is None. This suggests a need to add a check for None estimators within the sample weight support logic. The search results include several relevant sections of code, notably 'check_sample_weights_invariance', which tests the invariance of sample weights, and 'check_estimators_empty_data_messages', which checks for proper error handling with empty data. These sections are relevant as they involve fit checks and handling of estimators.\n\nThe 'check_sample_weights_invariance' function is particularly relevant because it directly involves checking the behavior of estimators with respect to sample weights. It tests whether setting sample weights to ones is equivalent to not setting them, which is a close analogy to the issue of handling None estimators. The other functions, such as 'check_estimators_empty_data_messages' and 'check_estimators_fit_returns_self', are also relevant as they involve fit method checks and general estimator behavior, which is pertinent to ensuring robust handling of different estimator states, including None.\n\nBased on the analysis, the identified spans include 'check_sample_weights_invariance', 'check_estimators_empty_data_messages', and 'check_estimators_fit_returns_self', as they directly relate to the issue of estimator state handling during fit, which is the crux of the reported problem.",

The error occurs because there is no check for an estimator being None when sample_weight support is being checked. The provided file context shows that the VotingClassifier class in sklearn/ensemble/voting.py has a fit method that checks for the format of y and the voting strategy. It also includes a call to the superclass fit method. The search results provide more detail on the VotingClassifier class, including the fit method, predict method, and related functionalities. Notably, the fit method includes checks for the format of y, the voting strategy, and whether sample weights are supported by each estimator. However, there is no explicit check for an estimator being None within the fit method or the _BaseVoting superclass. This indicates a potential gap that could be addressed by adding a check for None estimators within the fit method.",
