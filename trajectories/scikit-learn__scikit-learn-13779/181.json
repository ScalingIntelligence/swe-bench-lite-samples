This suggests that the current implementation does not check for `None` estimators before attempting to call `fit` on them. The relevant code spans to address this issue would involve the `fit` method in the `VotingClassifier` class. Specifically, we need to ensure that we check for `None` estimators before calling `fit` and handle this scenario accordingly. The provided `search_results` contain the `fit` method and the `__init__` method of the `VotingClassifier`, which initializes the estimators. These are relevant because modifying the `fit` method to include a check for `None` estimators and handling them appropriately will resolve the issue.
