The `fit` method in `VotingClassifier` extends this behavior but does not explicitly handle the fitting of estimators when some are `None`. There is a gap in handling individual `None` estimators within the loop that fits each estimator, which requires additional code to check if an estimator is `None` before attempting to fit it.
