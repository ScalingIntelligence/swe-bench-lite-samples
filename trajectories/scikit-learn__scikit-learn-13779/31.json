Upon reviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are found within the '_BaseVoting.fit' and 'VotingClassifier.fit' methods. In '_BaseVoting.fit', there is a check for `None` estimators, but it only raises an error if all estimators are None, not when just one estimator is missing. This explains the error seen in the issue, where a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fit'. The missing validation that an individual estimator might be `None` leads to this failure when attempting to fit the VotingClassifier with sample weights. Additionally, the 'VotingClassifier.fit' method extends the '_BaseVoting.fit' method and adds preprocessing specific to classification tasks. This context is also crucial as it pertains to the specific scenario outlined in the issue.",

This issue stems from the fact that the current implementation does not check if any estimators are None before attempting to fit them with sample weights.

To address this, the relevant code spans should include places where the fit method of _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier are defined, as well as the helper function _parallel_fit_estimator which is used during the fitting process. Specifically, the _BaseVoting.fit and VotingClassifier.fit methods need to be updated to include a check for None estimators before proceeding with the fitting process when sample_weight is provided. Additionally, the _parallel_fit_estimator function should include a similar check to ensure that the fitting process is not attempted on estimators that are None.
