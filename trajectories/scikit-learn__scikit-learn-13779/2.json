The key problem lies in the inadequate check for None estimators when sample weights are handled. The search results provided the relevant code spans from the `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py` file. Specifically, the `fit` method of `VotingClassifier` needs to be examined for potential improvements in handling None estimators with sample weights. The existing logic in the `fit` method checks for the presence of sample weights but does not specifically handle the case where an estimator might be None, which leads to the observed AttributeError. The provided code includes the `fit` methods of `_BaseVoting`, `VotingClassifier`, and `VotingRegressor`. Given that `VotingClassifier` inherits from `_BaseVoting`, the logic for handling sample weights and None estimators needs to be enhanced within the `fit` method of `_BaseVoting` to prevent the failure.",
