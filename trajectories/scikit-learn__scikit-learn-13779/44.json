In the `_BaseVoting.fit` method, there is a check for `None` estimators, but it doesn't handle cases where an estimator is explicitly set to `None` after initialization, leading to the failure described. The `VotingClassifier.fit` method inherits this behavior from `_BaseVoting.fit`. To address the issue, the code should include a check for `None` specifically in the estimators list before attempting to fit them, ensuring that such cases are handled gracefully.
