The '_BaseVoting' class and 'VotingClassifier' class are directly related to the handling of estimators and sample weights during the fit process. Specifically, the '_BaseVoting.fit' and 'VotingClassifier.fit' methods include checks for the number of estimators and weights, but lack a specific check for None in the estimators when sample weights are present. This omission matches the described issue.
