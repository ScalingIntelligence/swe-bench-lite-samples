This failure occurs because there is no explicit check for an estimator being None when sample weights are supported during the fit process. The provided search results include relevant code spans that address the `fit` method in the `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` classes. The `_BaseVoting.fit` code span contains the logic for fitting the estimators, including handling sample weights and checking for None estimators, but it does not explicitly address the case where an estimator is set to None after initialization. The `VotingClassifier` class also includes a `fit` method that calls the superclass `fit` method, which suggests that the issue could be addressed by adding a check for None estimators specifically in the context of sample weight support within the `_BaseVoting.fit` method. Additionally, the code spans related to both `VotingClassifier` and `_BaseVoting` are necessary to understand the full context of handling estimators and weights in the ensemble methods.",

The `fit` method in `_BaseVoting` checks for the `None` status of estimators only once to raise a ValueError if all estimators are `None`. However, it does not check for individual `None` estimators when iterating through them for fitting with `sample_weight`.\n\nThe relevant code spans are those within the `fit` methods of `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier`, as well as the method where the estimators are iterated over for fitting, particularly where `sample_weight` might be involved. This includes the following code spans: `_BaseVoting.fit` and `VotingClassifier.fit`.\n\nGiven the issue and the current code state, the necessary modifications should include adding checks for `None` estimators within the `sample_weight` handling part of the `fit` methods to prevent the `fit` method from attempting to use `None` estimators with `sample_weight`.",
