The task is to identify relevant code spans that handle the fitting process with `sample_weight` and setting the parameters of the estimators within the `VotingClassifier`.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant spans are within the `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py` file, particularly in the `_BaseVoting` class. The spans include:\n1. `_BaseVoting.fit`: This span contains the `fit` method that checks the validity of the estimators and handles the `sample_weight` parameter.\n2. `_BaseVoting.set_params`: This span contains the `set_params` method that allows setting the parameters of the estimators, including setting an estimator to `None`.\n3. `VotingClassifier.fit`: Although this span is an implementation of the `fit` method in the `VotingClassifier` class, it doesn't directly handle the `None` type check for estimators; it focuses on the voting strategy and label encoding.\n\nThe critical part of the code to address the issue is within the `_BaseVoting.fit` method, which needs to be updated to handle the case where an estimator is `None` when `sample_weight` is provided. This would involve adding a check for `None` in the estimators before attempting to fit them with weights.\n\nFrom the analysis, the relevant code spans are in the `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py` file, specifically the spans `_BaseVoting.fit` and `_BaseVoting.set_params`.",
