The search results contain the relevant code for the VotingClassifier and its base class _BaseVoting. The _BaseVoting class's fit method contains the logic for handling sample weights and the check for None estimators. The VotingClassifier class's fit method inherits from _BaseVoting and further checks for the voting strategy. These sections are relevant as they directly relate to the logic that could cause the error described in the issue. Specifically, the _BaseVoting.fit span checks the length of the estimators and weights, ensures that all estimators are not None, and handles sample weights. The VotingClassifier.fit span inherits this method but also includes additional checks related to the voting strategy and label encoding, which could also affect the reported issue if these checks fail when an estimator is None. Together, these spans cover the relevant code that would need to be examined and possibly modified to address the reported issue of the VotingClassifier failing at fit due to a None estimator when weights are passed.",
