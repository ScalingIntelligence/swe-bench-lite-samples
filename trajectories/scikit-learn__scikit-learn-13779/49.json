The search results provide a detailed look into the implementation of the `VotingClassifier` and its base class `_BaseVoting`. I analyzed the code spans to identify the relevant parts that address the issue. The `_BaseVoting.fit` method contains the initial checks for the `estimators` attribute, ensuring that none of them are None. However, it does not specifically check if individual estimators assigned within the `estimators` list are None before attempting to fit them. This gap could be the reason for the reported AttributeError. The `VotingClassifier.fit` method further processes the y data and calls the base class's fit, but it does not add more specific checks related to None estimators with sample weights. To address the issue, we need to explicitly check for None estimators within the `estimators` list when sample weights are provided and handle such cases gracefully.",

The issue is that the definition of `fit` in the abstract class does not include the logic to handle `None` estimators before cloning and fitting. Implementing the fix in the abstract class would require broadening the scope that might cause unintended side effects and violate coding standards.
