The current implementation does not explicitly check for `None` estimators before calling their `fit` method, leading to an `AttributeError`. To address this, we need to identify the relevant sections of the code that handle estimator initialization, fitting, and parameter setting. The search results include several key spans in the `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` classes. Specifically, the spans related to `fit`, `set_params`, and `named_estimators` are crucial for understanding how estimators are managed and how the `fit` method is implemented.
