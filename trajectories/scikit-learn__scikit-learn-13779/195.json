The current implementation in the `_BaseVoting` class does have checks for `None` estimators and raises a `ValueError` if all estimators are `None`. However, it does not explicitly check for `None` for individual estimators before attempting to fit them with sample weights. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the `fit` method in classes `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier`, specifically where the estimators are being processed and fitted.

The changes also respect the original structure of handling `sample_weight` within the `fit` method. It appears that no further changes are needed to resolve the issue. The `VotingRegressor` class remains unaffected by these changes, as it did not have an implementation for handling `sample_weight` in the provided context.",
