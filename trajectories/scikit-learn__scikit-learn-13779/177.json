This issue arises because the code does not explicitly check if any of the estimators are None before calling their fit method. The relevant code spans in the search results that address this issue are the initialization of the VotingClassifier (`VotingClassifier.__init__`) and the fit method itself (`VotingClassifier.fit`). Both of these spans are relevant because they involve the handling of estimators and sample weights, which are central to the issue. The fit method needs to be modified to check if any estimators are None before attempting to fit them, especially when sample weights are provided.

The error occurs because the code does not check for an estimator being None when handling sample_weight during the fit method. From the provided file context and search results, the relevant sections of code that address this issue are primarily located within the _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier classes. In _BaseVoting, the fit method handles the iteration over estimators to check if they support sample_weight, but it does not explicitly handle the case where an estimator might be None. In VotingClassifier, the fit method delegates to the superclass fit method, which is where the check against None should be added to prevent the AttributeError. The search results also confirm that VotingClassifier inherits from _BaseVoting, and both classes need adjustments to properly handle a None estimator when sample_weight is provided. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those pertaining to the fit methods in both _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier.",
