This is due to the lack of a check for whether an estimator is None when sample_weight is supported. The relevant code spans from the search results are primarily in the `VotingClassifier` class and its `fit` method, where the logic for handling sample weights is implemented. The `fit` method of `VotingClassifier` calls the `fit` method of `_BaseVoting`, which contains the code that throws the AttributeError due to a None estimator. Given this context, the solution involves modifying the `fit` method in the `_BaseVoting` class to check for None estimators before attempting to call their `fit` method, ensuring that only non-None estimators are processed.

It also checks whether all estimators support sample weights if they are provided. The method then clones and fits each non-None estimator in parallel using the _parallel_fit_estimator function. However, the code does not explicitly check for None-valued estimators after initializing the list or after potential changes to the list (such as modifying an estimator via set_params). This lack of continuous None-checking in the fit method could leave the door open for errors when an estimator is accidentally set to None, especially considering that such a change could arise dynamically (e.g., during runtime via set_params). Therefore, a modification should be incorporated to ensure that a None check is conducted just before fitting each estimator; and similarly, within the _parallel_fit_estimator function to protect against runtime changes that could set an estimator to None after the initial list validation.",

Similarly, the `fit` method in the `VotingClassifier` calls the superclass `fit` method, making it susceptible to the same issue.

This check occurs during the instantiation of the estimators list and during the fitting process. However, there is currently no continuous check for None-valued estimators beyond the initial fit method. Since the set_params method could potentially change the state of an estimator to None post-initialization, it is crucial to ensure that this method, or any other method that alters the state of the estimator between the initial setting and the fit method call, includes consistent None-checks. It appears that the set_params method is indeed the primary mechanism for altering estimator states after initialization in the VotingClassifier class.

The codebase provided includes the `_BaseVoting` abstract class which the `VotingClassifier` inherits from. In the `_BaseVoting` class, the `fit` method currently checks that no more than one estimator is `None` and raises an error if all are `None`. However, it does not specifically check if a single estimator is `None` with sample weights being passed, which is the scenario causing the reported issue. This specific issue is not directly handled in the `fit` method of `_BaseVoting` or `VotingClassifier`. The search results reveal the `set_params` method in `_BaseVoting`, which is relevant because it is used to set an estimator to `None` as shown in the example code of the reported issue. Although the `set_params` method itself does not directly address the problem, understanding how parameters are set including setting an estimator to `None` is essential for identifying the location of the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans identified from the `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` classes should be those encapsulating the `fit` method logic to ensure all paths involving potential `None` estimators are checked for sample weight compatibility before proceeding with the fitting process.",

The _BaseVoting fit method contains an initial check for None-valued estimators, ensuring that at least one estimator is not None. This check occurs during the instantiation of the estimators list and during the fitting process. However, there is currently no continuous check for None-valued estimators beyond the initial fit method. Since the set_params method could potentially change the state of an estimator to None post-initialization, it is crucial to ensure that this method, or any other method that alters the state of the estimator between the initial setting and the fit method call, includes consistent None-checks. It appears that the set_params method is indeed the primary mechanism for altering estimator states after initialization in the VotingClassifier class. Therefore, enhancing checks for None-valued estimators within the set_params method would be a priority to prevent the error scenario detailed in the issue.",
