The key to resolving this issue is to ensure that the `fit` method checks for `None` estimators before attempting to fit with `sample_weight`. Currently, the `fit` method in `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` checks for `None` estimators but does not handle the scenario where `sample_weight` is passed along with a `None` estimator. To fix this, an additional check should be added in both `fit` methods where it only iterates over estimators that are not `None`. This additional check should ensure that the `fit` method does not attempt to call `fit` on a `None` estimator when `sample_weight` is provided. The `_BaseVoting.fit` and `VotingClassifier.fit` code spans are thus identified as relevant because they are directly related to the `fit` method and the handling of `sample_weight` in the context of `None` estimators.",

After examining the provided code spans in the <search_results> and the existing context in <file_context>, it's clear that the current implementation of the `fit` method in `_BaseVoting` does not handle the case where one of the estimators is `None`. Specifically, in the `fit` method, the code iterates over all estimators, even when some might be `None`, and attempts to call the `fit` method on them, leading to the `AttributeError`. To address this issue, the code needs to be modified to check for `None` estimators before attempting to fit them and handle such cases appropriately.
