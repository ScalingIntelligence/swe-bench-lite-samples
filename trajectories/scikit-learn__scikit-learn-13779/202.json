The __init__ method defines the parameters, including the 'estimators' list which holds the models to be used. The fit method appears to be where the error might occur, as it attempts to fit all estimators provided. As per the issue description, when an estimator is set to None, it leads to a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'fit', which can be directly observed in the context of the fit method. Given the issue at hand and the provided code, it's evident that the identified section is relevant and directly addresses the problem space as defined by the issue.
