This issue arises because the code does not check if an estimator is None before attempting to fit it with sample weights. The provided code context and search results contain the relevant methods 'fit' and 'set_params' in both '_BaseVoting' and 'VotingClassifier' classes. The 'fit' method in '_BaseVoting' iterates over estimators and fits them in parallel, but it doesn't check if an estimator is None before attempting to fit. The 'set_params' method in '_BaseVoting' allows setting parameters for estimators, which could include setting an estimator to None. This potential absence of a None check in the 'fit' method leads to the AttributeError reported. To address this, the 'fit' method should include a check for None before fitting each estimator to avoid the error when an estimator is None and sample weights are provided.",

Additionally, the `set_params` method is used to update estimator parameters, but it doesn't explicitly check for or handle `None` estimators after updating. Therefore, it might be necessary to add additional checks within the `set_params` method to ensure that setting an estimator to `None` is handled appropriately, especially when sample weights are involved.",
