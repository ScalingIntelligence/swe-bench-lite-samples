This appears to be due to not checking if an estimator is None before attempting to fit it with sample weights. The search results provide several relevant spans of code within the VotingClassifier class and its parent _BaseVoting class. Specifically, the `fit` method in _BaseVoting checks if all estimators are None and raises an error, which seems relevant. However, it does not specifically check for an individual estimator being None before attempting to fit it with sample weights, which is where the error occurs. The code span from _BaseVoting.fit is particularly relevant as it iterates over estimators without checking if they are None before attempting to clone and fit them in parallel. This confirms the issue's relevance as it directly deals with fitting and sample weights. The VotingClassifier.fit method is also relevant as it performs additional checks and transformations specific to classification tasks but does not add a specific None check for individual estimators. Both fit methods are candidates where a check for None estimators should be added to handle the reported issue.",
