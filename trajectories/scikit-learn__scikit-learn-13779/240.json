I need to identify the relevant code spans in the search results that handle the `fit` method and the setting of estimators to `None`, as well as the code that checks for `sample_weight`. The current context already shows part of the `VotingClassifier` class, particularly the `fit` method. In the new search results, I can see the entire `_BaseVoting` class, which `VotingClassifier` inherits from, and various methods within these classes that deal with estimators and `sample_weight` during the `fit` process. The `_BaseVoting.fit` method is particularly relevant as it validates the estimators and checks if they support `sample_weight`. Additionally, the `VotingClassifier.fit` method from the `VotingClassifier` class is also crucial for understanding how `sample_weight` is handled. Based on the reported issue, I will identify these specific sections of code that are directly related to the problem.",
