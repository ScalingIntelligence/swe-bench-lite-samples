This suggests that the current implementation does not handle the case where an estimator is set to None and weights are provided. By examining the relevant code spans in the search results, it's apparent that the logic for fitting the estimators does not currently check for the case where an estimator is None. Specifically, the fit method in _BaseVoting iterates over the estimators and attempts to clone and fit each one without first checking if it is None. This oversight leads to the AttributeError when a NoneType object is encountered. To address this, the fit method needs to be updated to check if each estimator is not None before attempting to fit it.",

The root cause identified is the lack of a check for `None` estimators before attempting to call their `fit` method. The provided search results contain the relevant code spans within the `VotingClassifier` and `_BaseVoting` classes, specifically focusing on the `fit` method and related functionalities. Given the issue description, the relevant code spans include the initialization of the `VotingClassifier`, its `fit` method, and the `fit` method in the `_BaseVoting` superclass where the core fitting logic resides. Based on the provided context, the identified spans effectively address the issue by showing the current implementation handling of estimators and sample weights, demonstrating the need for a specific check for `None` estimators to prevent the failure with sample weights.

The current context and search results show relevant parts of the VotingClassifier and _BaseVoting classes. The _BaseVoting class has a fit method that iterates over estimators and checks if sample_weight is supported. The VotingClassifier class inherits from _BaseVoting and implements its own fit method, which includes transforming the y values using LabelEncoder before calling the superclass fit method. The search results include the set_params method which is likely related to the manipulation of the estimators. Key spans include '_BaseVoting.fit' where the None check for estimators is performed, though it lacks a direct check for None after setting parameters. 'VotingClassifier.fit' is also crucial as this is the starting point of the fit process in VotingClassifier. Additionally, 'VotingClassifier.__init__' and '_BaseVoting.set_params' are important as they initialize and manipulate the estimators, which is necessary for understanding the flow when an estimator is set to None.
