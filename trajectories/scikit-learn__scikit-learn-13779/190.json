This problem arises because there is no check for an estimator being None before attempting to fit it with sample weights.\n\nFrom the current file context, we can see the definition of the VotingClassifier class and its fit method, which does some preliminary checks and then calls the fit method of the superclass. The superclass's fit method is not detailed in the context, but it is described as an abstract method.\n\nThe new search results provide a more detailed look at the _BaseVoting class, the superclass of VotingClassifier. In this class, we find the concrete implementation of the fit method. This implementation checks for the presence and validity of estimators, ensuring that none of them are None before attempting to fit them in parallel. However, it does not explicitly check if any individual estimator set to None after initialization, which may be the cause of the reported bug.\n\nGiven these details, I will identify the relevant code spans in _BaseVoting's fit method that are related to the handling of estimators and sample weights, as these are the areas likely needing a fix to address the reported issue.",
