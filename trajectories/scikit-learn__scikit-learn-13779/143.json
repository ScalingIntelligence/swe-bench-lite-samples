The code spans provided in the search results reveal several critical parts of the VotingClassifier implementation. First, the `fit` method in `_BaseVoting` class checks for the presence of estimators and their compatibility with sample weights. However, it does not explicitly check if an estimator is `None` after the initial check. This oversight could lead to the AttributeError described in the issue when a `None` estimator receives the `fit` call. In the `VotingClassifier` class, the `fit` method transforms the target `y` using LabelEncoder and then calls the `fit` method of the superclass `_BaseVoting`. The `fit` method in `_BaseVoting` should be modified to handle `None` estimators more gracefully to prevent the AttributeError. Specifically, the method should filter out `None` estimators prior to attempting to fit them. This will ensure that no `NoneType` object is attempted to be fit, thus avoiding the error. I recommend focusing changes in the `_BaseVoting.fit` method to include a check for `None` estimators within the list comprehension that clones and fits the estimators.",

The relevant code spans include the fit method in _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier class that handle the fitting of estimators with sample weights. The current implementation does not prevent the fitting process if an estimator is None, leading to the mentioned AttributeError. Therefore, the identified code spans directly relate to the issue. However, in the provided spans, there isn't a specific block of code that checks for the presence of None estimators during sample weight assignment.

This corresponds directly to the fit method in both the _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier classes. The _BaseVoting class contains the main logic for fitting the estimators and handling sample weights, while VotingClassifier extends this class and adds specific handling for classifier-related functionality. The existing code already checks for None estimators, but it does not handle them gracefully when sample weights are provided, leading to the reported issue. The relevant code spans involve methods that deal with setting and checking parameters, fitting estimators, and managing sample weights. Identifying these spans will help in addressing the reported issue by ensuring None estimators are properly handled when sample weights are present.",
