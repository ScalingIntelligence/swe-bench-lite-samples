The issue specifically mentions that a `VotingClassifier` with a `None` estimator will fail when sample weights are passed to the `fit` method. This implies we need to focus on the `fit` method and its interaction with the `estimators`. Upon analyzing the code, it's clear that the `fit` method of `_BaseVoting` class iterates over all estimators and their names. If a estimator is `None`, it will try to fit a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError`. Additionally, the `set_params` method in `_BaseVoting` is responsible for updating the parameters, including setting an estimator to `None`. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that involve the `fit` method in both `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` classes, as well as the `set_params` method in `_BaseVoting`.",
