The error occurs due to the 'NoneType' object not having a 'fit' attribute. The analysis of the provided code spans from the 'sklearn/ensemble/voting.py' file reveals the relevant parts that address the issue.\n\n1. The '_BaseVoting' class and its 'fit' method handle the fitting process for the ensemble estimators, including checks for the presence of 'sample_weight' and the handling of None estimators.\n2. The 'VotingClassifier' class inherits from '_BaseVoting' and implements its own 'fit' method, which transforms the target 'y' and then calls the superclass's 'fit' method. This is where the error might be triggered if an estimator is None.\n\nThese code spans cover the necessary hooks to address the issue, specifically the '_BaseVoting.fit' method where the None check for estimators is implemented. Additionally, the '_BaseVoting' class handles the parallel fitting of non-None estimators, which is critical for the voting mechanism to work correctly when some estimators are None. The 'VotingClassifier' specific code ensures the target is correctly transformed before fitting. These spans should be considered relevant and sufficient to identify the issue and address it.",

There is also the set_params method in _BaseVoting to possibly manage the setting of None to estimators.
