Upon reviewing the search results, the relevant code spans are identified in the `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` classes within `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py`. Specifically, the `fit` method in `_BaseVoting` checks if any of the estimators are None but does not handle the scenario where an estimator is set to None after the object is instantiated. This is crucial as the issue arises from setting the 'lr' estimator to None after it has been instantiated and attempting to fit the model with sample weights. Additionally, the `VotingClassifier.fit` method inherits from `_BaseVoting.fit` and applies specific logic for classification tasks, such as handling the voting type and transforming the labels, which is also relevant context to the issue. These code spans need to be reviewed to ensure that if an estimator is set to None post-instantiation, the model either handles it gracefully or raises an informative error before attempting to fit the estimators.",

This gap is aligned with the reported issue, suggesting that the code responsible for handling such cases (estimators being set to None while sample_weight is provided) might not exist or might not be comprehensive enough. Despite this, the file context is pertinent to the issue, as it includes the core logic of the VotingClassifier's fit method where the modification would likely take place.
