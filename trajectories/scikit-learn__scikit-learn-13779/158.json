The key point is the lack of a check for a None estimator when sample_weight is supported. The search results provide the code for the VotingClassifier class, focusing on the __init__ and fit methods. The __init__ method initializes the class with the estimators and other parameters. The fit method contains checks for the voting type and transforms the y data. However, it lacks a check for None estimators before attempting to fit them, which seems to be the cause of the reported issue. This matches the reported issue as the code does not handle the case where an estimator might be None when sample_weight is provided. Therefore, the relevant code spans are the __init__ and fit methods of the VotingClassifier class.",
