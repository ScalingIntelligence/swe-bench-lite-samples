This is due to the lack of checking for None estimators when sample weights are supported. The search results include the VotingClassifier class and its fit method, which aligns with the issue. The fit method of VotingClassifier does not explicitly check for None estimators before attempting to fit them with sample weights. This is likely the source of the error. Additionally, the _BaseVoting class, which is the base class for both VotingClassifier and VotingRegressor, also has a fit method that handles the sample weights but does not check for None estimators directly in the provided code span. To fix the issue, a check for None estimators should be added before attempting to use them with sample weights in both VotingClassifier and _BaseVoting classes. The relevant code spans to address this issue are the fit methods in _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier classes.",
