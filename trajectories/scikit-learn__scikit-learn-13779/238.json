The user reports that the underlying cause is that the code does not check for whether an estimator is None when sample weights are being applied.\n\nFrom the provided file context and search results, I see that the VotingClassifier class (inherited from _BaseVoting) primarily handles its fitting logic within the `fit` method. A key point in the `fit` method is where it checks if the sample weight is not None and iterates over estimators to ensure they support sample weights. There's no fallback or skip mechanism for if an estimator is None during this check, which underlies the reported error.\n\nIn order to fix this issue, a new condition must likely be implemented around the estimator's support for sample weights. This fix involves evaluating the estimator early in the `fit` method and making the necessary adjustments to how fitting is done. Given the structured nature of the Python machine learning library (\"scikit-learn\"), assumptions of when it is appropriate to keep, remove, or skip a None estimator as part of the ensemble have to be scrutinised to uphold both efficiency and robustness. Potential solutions might require more comprehensive edits, perhaps introducing new methods specifically for handling or substituting None estimators dynamically during model training. Such implementations should respect the general philosophy of alterations preserving the existing API integrity, maintaining the test coverage with additional unit and integration testing.\n\nFor now, the problem seems to stem from inadequate handling of estimators set to None, which, given the submitted context and available evaluation fields, strongly suggests the specific part of the code where changes need to occur. An upcoming task might involve deeper analytical tests furnished with, for example, an internal design document or developer-led session that outlines potential pathways.",
