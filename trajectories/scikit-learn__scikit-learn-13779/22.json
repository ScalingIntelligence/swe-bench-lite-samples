The code in '_BaseVoting.fit' specifically checks if any estimator is None and excludes these from the fitting process.

Notably, the current implementation in the VotingClassifier does not explicitly check for None estimators before attempting to fit them when sample weights are provided. Specifically, the part of the code where the estimators are iterated over and fitted does not include a check for None values, which leads to the AttributeError.
