The new search results provide a more detailed look at the _BaseVoting class, which is the base class for VotingClassifier. The _BaseVoting.fit method is of particular interest as it handles the fitting of the estimators in a parallel manner. It clones each estimator and fits it, but it does not check if the estimator is None before cloning and fitting. This is where the error could occur. Given this, the relevant code spans are those in the _BaseVoting.fit method, as they directly address the process of fitting estimators, including handling sample weights and checking for None estimators.

Within the `fit` method of `VotingClassifier`, there's a call to `super().fit(X, transformed_y, sample_weight)`, which passes control to the `_BaseVoting` class, where the actual fitting of the estimators takes place. In `_BaseVoting`, a check is performed before fitting each estimator to ensure that it is not `None`. This check handles the reported issue, preventing a `NoneType` object from being fitted and thus avoiding the `AttributeError`. Therefore, the relevant part of the code that addresses the issue is present in the provided file context.",
