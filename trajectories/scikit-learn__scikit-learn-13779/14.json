The error is an AttributeError stating that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fit'. 2. Review current context: No relevant code identified yet. 3. Process new search results: 3.1. Analyze each code span: - _BaseVoting.fit: This method checks if estimators are None or if the number of weights and estimators do not match. It also validates if sample_weight is supported by underlying estimators. - VotingClassifier.__init__: Initializes the VotingClassifier with estimators. - VotingClassifier.fit: Adds additional checks for voting type and transforms y using LabelEncoder before calling super().fit(). - VotingRegressor.fit: Directly calls super().fit(). - BaseWeightBoosting.fit: Manages sample_weight for boosting algorithms but does not seem directly related to the issue. - BaseForest.fit: Manages sample_weight for forest algorithms but also not directly related to the issue. - BaseBagging.fit: Manages sample_weight for bagging algorithms, not directly related. 3.2. Match code spans with the issue: The issue is about VotingClassifier failing at fit when an estimator is None. The relevant code spans are _BaseVoting.fit and VotingClassifier.fit. These spans handle the checks for None estimators and manage sample weights. 3.3. Evaluate relevance: The relevant code spans are _BaseVoting.fit and VotingClassifier.fit as they directly deal with the estimators and sample_weight. 3.4. Identify new functions or classes needed: No new functions or classes suggested in the issue. 3.5. Review entire sections: The entire sections for _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier are reviewed to ensure complete understanding of how estimators and sample_weight are handled. 3.6. Verify references: No additional references to other parts of the codebase are found in the spans. 3.7. Extract relevant code spans: _BaseVoting.fit and VotingClassifier.fit are identified as relevant. 4. Respond using the function: Identify function is used to provide the response.",
