The code spans provided show parts of the VotingClassifier class and its fit method, as well as the base class _BaseVoting. The relevant code spans are those that deal with the fitting process, particularly where estimators are iterated over and cloned for fitting. The issue can be addressed by adding a check for `None` estimators within the `fit` method of the VotingClassifier or the base class _BaseVoting. The spans '_BaseVoting.fit' and 'VotingClassifier.fit' are relevant, especially the part in '_BaseVoting.fit' where it copies and fits estimators, and checks for the presence of sample weights. The check for the number of estimators and weights in '_BaseVoting.fit' should also be expanded to look for any `None` estimators and raise an appropriate error if found.",

However, it does not explicitly check if an individual estimator is None before calling its fit method when sample weights are provided.

This occurs because there is no check for an estimator being `None` when `sample_weight` support is being checked. To address this, we need to ensure that the `fit` method in `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` properly handles cases where an estimator is `None`. The provided search results provide parts of the code that are crucial to understanding how the `fit` method is currently implemented and how it deals with `sample_weight`. In particular, the spans for `_BaseVoting.fit` and `VotingClassifier.fit` show the current implementation of the `fit` method and how it interacts with the estimators. It's necessary to ensure that this method checks for `None` estimators before attempting to fit them, and particularly before handling `sample_weight`. Furthermore, the `set_params` method in `_BaseVoting` allows for setting an estimator to `None`, and this flow must be accounted for to prevent the `AttributeError` described in the issue.",
