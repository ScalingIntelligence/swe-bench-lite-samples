In the provided context from `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py`, the `fit` method of `_BaseVoting` already contains some validation logic, but it does not explicitly check for `None` in the loop where it processes and clones each estimator prior to fitting them in parallel. Similarly, the `VotingClassifier` inherits this `fit` method and does its initial checks but does not specifically address the scenario where an estimator might be set to `None` post-initialization. A more comprehensive validation check, potentially integrated in the `fit` method, ensuring that each estimator is not `None` before attempting to use their `fit` method, should be added. This preventive measure might mitigate the error triggered by attempting to fit a `NoneType` object. Additionally, reviewing the `set_params` method could also disclose necessary updates to reinforce the check and validation of each estimator in the context of potential `None` assignment.",

This method processes each estimator by cloning it and then fitting it in parallel. However, the current `fit` method does not explicitly check if an estimator is `None` immediately before calling its `fit` method. This vulnerability is the crux of the issue reported. Additionally, the `set_params` method, while it overrides parameters, does not currently employ specific checks to prevent setting an estimator to `None` without an ensuing validation. This implies that after using `set_params` to set an estimator to `None`, subsequent calls to `fit` may encounter errors when attempting to use a `None` estimator. To adequately address this, immediate checks for `None` estimators prior to each `fit` call should be implemented within the `fit` method within the loop where estimators are processed. Such a measure would shield against attempting to fit a `NoneType` object. Furthermore, enhancing the `set_params` method with additional validation to identify `None` assignments could prevent similar issues from arising earlier in the process.",

The key elements to look for are the handling of sample weights and the treatment of estimators when they are set to None. From the search results, it's clear that the _BaseVoting class contains the core logic for handling the estimators and sample weights. The fit method in _BaseVoting checks if the estimators are valid and if the sample weights are supported by each estimator. It also handles the case where all estimators are None by raising a ValueError. This logic covers the scenario described in the issue. Additionally, the VotingClassifier class inherits from _BaseVoting and implements its fit method, which includes specific checks for the type of voting and transformation of the target labels. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the fit method in both _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier, as they encompass the necessary checks and logic to address the issue.",
