The error arises because there is no check for an estimator being None when sample_weights are supported and passed to the fit method. The search results provided include the VotingClassifier class definition and its fit method. In the __init__ method, the estimators are defined but there is no explicit check for None values when initializing or during the fit process. This aligns with the issue reported, where the lack of such a check leads to an error when a None estimator is encountered. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those that involve the VotingClassifier's initialization and fit methods, specifically looking into how estimators and sample_weight parameters are handled.",

This error occurs due to a lack of checks for None estimators in the sample_weight support within the fit method. The current implementation of the fit method in the VotingClassifier class does not specifically handle the case where an estimator is None before attempting to fit it. The analysis of the search results reveals that the _BaseVoting class includes methods for fitting estimators in parallel and checking for None estimators, but this logic is not directly incorporated into the VotingClassifier's fit method. The relevant code spans to address the issue include the fit method in both _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier classes. The VotingClassifier's fit method should incorporate checks similar to those in _BaseVoting to handle None estimators gracefully.",
