Analyzing the code, within the _BaseVoting class, there's a check for None estimators but it doesn't specifically guard against an estimator being set to None after initialization but before fit. The VotingClassifier._init__ doesn't explicitly handle None values passed initially. However, in the fit method (VotingClassifier.fit and _BaseVoting.fit), there's a check for 'sample_weight' support, but not for an estimator being None when sample weights are given. Therefore, both the __init__ method (span_id='VotingClassifier.__init__') and fit method (span_id='VotingClassifier.fit') are critically relevant, as well as their parent class (span_id='_BaseVoting.fit'), because the issue likely lies in how these methods handle the random setting of an estimator to None post-initialization.",

The _BaseVoting.fit method iterates over estimators and calls _parallel_fit_estimator on each, but it does not explicitly check for estimators being None within the loop where sample weights are handled. The VotingClassifier.fit method first checks for some conditions and then delegates to the superclass's fit method.
