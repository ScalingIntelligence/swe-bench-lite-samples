The error occurs because the code does not handle the case where an estimator is None when sample weights are used. The search results contain significant portions of the VotingClassifier and its base class _BaseVoting. Notably, the `fit` method in _BaseVoting checks for the presence of sample weights but does not explicitly check if an estimator is None before attempting to fit it, which could lead to an AttributeError. The `fit` method in VotingClassifier inherits from _BaseVoting and adds specific logic for handling classification tasks, including label encoding and voting type checks. There is also a mention of using parallel processing to fit estimators, which could potentially fail if an estimator is None. Based on the reported issue, the relevant code spans are those within the `fit` methods of _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier, especially where it checks for the presence of sample weights but not for the None condition on estimators.",
