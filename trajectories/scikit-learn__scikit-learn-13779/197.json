This failure results from the lack of a check for `None` estimators before calling their `fit` method with sample weights. To address this, we need to identify where and how estimators are being set to `None` and where the `fit` method is called with sample weights. Two main files are of interest: `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py` and `sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py`. In `voting.py`, the `VotingClassifier` class and its `fit` method are crucial, especially since it's directly implicated in the stack trace. The `estimator_checks.py` might contain utilities for setting parameters, including setting estimators to `None`.",
