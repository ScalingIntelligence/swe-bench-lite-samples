This is because the fit method does not check if an estimator is None before attempting to call its fit method. The relevant sections of code to address this issue are located in the VotingClassifier class under the 'sklearn/ensemble/voting.py' file. Specifically, the fit method of the VotingClassifier class should be modified to check for None estimators before attempting to fit them with sample weights. The current implementation does check for None estimators before parallel fitting but not for the sample weight check. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those containing the fit method in the _BaseVoting class and the VotingClassifier class.",
