By examining the search results, it's clear that the VotingClassifier and its base class _BaseVoting contain the fit methods that handle sample_weight and estimators. Specifically, the _BaseVoting.fit method already includes checks for the presence of estimators and sample_weight, but it lacks a check for a specific estimator being None before attempting to fit it. This aligns with the issue reported. The other fit methods found in unrelated classes like BaseGradientBoosting, BaseWeightBoosting, BaseForest, and BaseBagging are not directly relevant as they do not pertain to the handling of a voting classifier or its specific issue with passing weights and None estimators. Therefore, the focus should be on enhancing _BaseVoting.fit by adding a check for None estimators before attempting to fit them, similar to how the method already checks for the presence of estimators and sample_weight.",

This is due to the lack of a check for None estimators when handling sample weights. To address this issue, we need to focus on the implementation of the fit method in the VotingClassifier and its parent class _BaseVoting. The current implementation in _BaseVoting.fit already checks if all estimators are None but does not specifically handle individual None estimators within the loop where sample weights are processed. The relevant code spans in the new search results show the fit methods in _BaseVoting, VotingClassifier, and other related classes. We should identify the sections that handle the estimators list and the sample weights. The most relevant span is the _BaseVoting.fit method, which includes the loop where sample weights are checked against the estimators' fit parameters. It is clear that we need to add a check for None estimators within this loop to prevent the AttributeError when trying to fit a NoneType object. Therefore, the identified spans focus on the fit method implementations for _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier as these are the primary classes involved in the issue.",
