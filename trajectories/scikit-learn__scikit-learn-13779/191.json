This occurs because the code does not check if an estimator is None when handling sample_weight support. To address this, we should focus on the VotingClassifier class within the sklearn/ensemble/voting.py file, specifically around the fit method. Additionally, since sample weights are involved, we should also check the handling of sample weights across other relevant files to ensure consistency.",

From the search results, the relevant sections are within the `_BaseVoting.fit` method and the `VotingClassifier.fit` method. These sections are critical because they handle the fitting of estimators, including the validation of estimators and the handling of sample weights. The presence of a check for None estimators within the `_BaseVoting.fit` method is crucial, as it indicates where the error originates from. Additionally, the `VotingClassifier.fit` method is where the specific class implements the fitting process, which includes transformations and calls to the superclass's fit method.

This implies that if an estimator is None, it will not reach the _parallel_fit_estimator function. Therefore, as long as the initial filtering in the fit method is sufficient, the _parallel_fit_estimator function may not need additional changes to handle None-valued estimators explicitly. Given this, I will mark the search as complete since the existing checks seem to prevent None-valued estimators from being processed further down the fitting pipeline when sample weights are present.",
