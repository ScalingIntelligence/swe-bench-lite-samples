This implies a need to check for None estimators when sample weights are provided. The provided search results contain relevant code spans within the _BaseVoting class and specifically within the fit method. The fit method currently handles sample weights but does not explicitly check for None estimators, which is likely causing the issue. The VotingClassifier class also has an initialisation method that could be responsible for setting estimators to None, which is why it's important to parse spans that could lead to such setting or checking. Identifying the span where the sample_weight parameter is processed and where the estimators are handled within the fit method is crucial. The _validate_names and _parallel_fit_estimator methods indirectly support the focus on checking each estimator, which is a vital step to ensure none are None before processing.",
