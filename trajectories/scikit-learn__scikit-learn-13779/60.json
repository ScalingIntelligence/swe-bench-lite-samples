This omission could lead to the observed error. The related spans '_BaseVoting.fit' and '_BaseVoting.set_params' are directly involved in the fitting process and setting parameters, respectively. Both are relevant for addressing the issue. The 'VotingClassifier.fit' method appears to handle some validations and transformations before delegating to the '_BaseVoting.fit' method, making it also relevant.

The current code already checks if the estimators list is empty or None, and it raises an AttributeError if it is. However, it does not specifically check for a None estimator within the list when sample weights are provided. The relevant code spans in the search results confirm this. The '_BaseVoting.fit' method checks if the estimators list is empty or None, verifies the number of weights, and checks if the estimators support sample weights. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where an estimator within the list is None. The 'VotingClassifier.fit' method inherits from '_BaseVoting.fit' and also does not explicitly check for None estimators when sample weights are provided. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant as they provide the context in which the issue can be addressed.

The error occurs because the code does not check if an estimator is None before attempting to fit it with sample weights. The relevant code spans provided in the search results show the implementation of the fit method in the _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier classes. Notably, the _BaseVoting.fit method already contains checks for the presence of estimators and their compatibility with sample weights, but it does not specifically check for None estimators before calling _parallel_fit_estimator. The VotingClassifier.fit method inherits and uses this logic. Thus, the identified spans are relevant to addressing the issue by adding a check for None estimators within the fit method. This check should prevent the fit method from attempting to fit None estimators with sample weights, thereby avoiding the AttributeError.",
