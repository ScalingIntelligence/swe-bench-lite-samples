To address this, the relevant code spans need to handle the case where an estimator is None. By examining the search results, the _BaseVoting.fit method contains logic to handle the fit of estimators with sample weights. Specifically, it checks if the underlying estimator supports sample weights and it also checks if all estimators are None. However, it does not explicitly check if an individual estimator is None before attempting to clone and fit it, which could lead to the reported error. The VotingClassifier.fit method inherits from _BaseVoting.fit, and it includes additional checks for voting type and label encoding, but it does not add new handling for None estimators. Therefore, the relevant span is '_BaseVoting.fit' where the initial checks are performed. The span 'VotingClassifier.fit' is also relevant as it demonstrates how the fit method is used in the context of a classifier, integrating with label encoding, but primarily the issue is rooted in _BaseVoting.fit. This analysis suggests that the missing check for None estimators should be added in the '_BaseVoting.fit' span to prevent the error.",

These are relevant because they hint at how the user can set an estimator to None during or after initialization. However, the key issue mentioned in the reported issue, which is likely to occur in the fit method, is the lack of a check for None estimators when sample weights are provided.\n\nConsidering both the current context and the new search results, the fit method still misses a critical check for individual estimators being None before fitting.

The codebase analysis reveals the `_BaseVoting.fit` method where the estimators are processed and fitted. Notably, the method checks if all estimators are None and raises a ValueError in such a case but does not explicitly check individual estimators being None before attempting to fit them. Specifically, the line `for clf in clfs if clf is not None` filters out None estimators, but it's within the context of parallel job execution, meaning the error might occur earlier in cases where a None estimator is set but not properly filtered before entering this loop. Additionally, the `_BaseVoting.set_params` method is identified as a potential spot where an estimator could be set to None, though it does not directly address the fitting process with sample weights. Given the nature of the issue, relevant code spans involve the `_BaseVoting.fit` method for the error handling and estimator fitting logic, and the `_BaseVoting.set_params` method for managing estimator states. These methods encapsulate the core functionality where the issue is likely to be resolved by adding specific checks for None estimators when sample weights are passed during the fit process.",
