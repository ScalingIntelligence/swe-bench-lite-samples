The error message indicates an AttributeError because the NoneType object does not have the fit attribute. This suggests that the VotingClassifier class does not properly handle the case where an estimator is set to None when sample weights are provided. To address this, we need to search for the fit method within the VotingClassifier class to identify where the None check is missing and ensure that such a check is implemented to prevent the AttributeError. Additionally, it might be beneficial to search across other relevant classes within the 'sklearn/ensemble/' directory, as the issue might be related to how ensembles handle None estimators and sample weights.",

The search results provide the implementation of `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier`, which are relevant to the issue. In the `fit` method of `_BaseVoting`, there is a check for `None` estimators but it doesn't account for a scenario where an estimator is set to `None` after initialization. The `VotingClassifier` class inherits from `_BaseVoting` and overrides the `fit` method. However, while it checks for `None` in the initialization of `estimators`, it doesn't handle the scenario where an estimator is set to `None` post-initialization and then `fit` is called again with `sample_weight`. This is likely the cause of the reported error.
