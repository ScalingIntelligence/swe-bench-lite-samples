This indicates a need to check for `None` estimators in the `fit` method when `sample_weight` is provided. By examining the provided code snippets, we find that the `_BaseVoting.fit` method already has some checks for `None` estimators and sample weights, but it does not explicitly handle the case where an estimator is set to `None` after initialization. The `VotingClassifier.fit` method delegates the fitting process to `_BaseVoting.fit`, but does not handle the scenario where an estimator is `None` after the initial fitting process. This oversight can lead to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fit'` as reported. To address this, we need to update the `_BaseVoting.fit` method to handle estimators that are `None` at the time of fitting, ensuring that such estimators are skipped or an appropriate error is raised sooner. Additionally, the current context suggests that the relevant code spans are within the `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier` classes.",
