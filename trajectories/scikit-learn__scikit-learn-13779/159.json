This suggests a need to handle the case where an estimator is set to `None` more gracefully in the fitting process, especially when `sample_weight` is provided. The relevant code spans are identified from the `_BaseVoting.fit` and `VotingClassifier.fit` methods. Specifically, within `_BaseVoting.fit`, the handling of `sample_weight` is crucial, especially when iterating over `self.estimators` to check if they support `sample_weight`. The current implementation does not check for `None` estimators among those that support `sample_weight`. This oversight probably leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to call `fit` on a `NoneType` object.
