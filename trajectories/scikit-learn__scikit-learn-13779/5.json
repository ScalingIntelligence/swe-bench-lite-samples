This can happen during the fit method because the code does not check if an estimator is None before attempting to fit it. This will result in an AttributeError because a NoneType object does not have a 'fit' method.\n\nExamining the existing codebase shows that the VotingClassifier and its parent class _BaseVoting have methods related to handling estimators and sample weights. The fit method in _BaseVoting is particularly relevant as it processes the estimators and checks for support of sample weights. The current implementation in _BaseVoting does not explicitly handle cases where an estimator might be None before trying to fit it, which leads to the reported issue.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to identify the relevant sections of code responsible for handling the fitting of each estimator and ensure that None estimators are properly addressed before the fit method is called. The following spans are identified as relevant:\n\n1. '_BaseVoting.fit' - This method processes the estimators and currently does not check for None estimators before attempting to fit them.\n2.

The fit method, however, does not explicitly check for None estimators within the super().fit() method call. This gap in the code can lead to the depicted AttributeError when an estimator is None and sample weights are passed. Therefore, the file context is relevant as it points to the need for an enhancement, specifically including checks for None estimators within the fit method before proceeding with the fitting process. Nonetheless, the specific implementation of how to incorporate this check is not provided in the context. Achieving completeness thus relies on refining an appropriate check method.",
