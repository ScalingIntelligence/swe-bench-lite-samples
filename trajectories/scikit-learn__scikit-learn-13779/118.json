The error occurs because the current implementation does not check if the estimator is None before calling its fit method, leading to an AttributeError. After analyzing the provided code spans from the VotingClassifier and its base class _BaseVoting, it's clear that the following code spans are relevant: 1. '_BaseVoting.fit' - This method processes the estimators and fits them using parallelism. The issue lies in not handling the case where an estimator could be None. 2. 'VotingClassifier.fit' - This method specifically handles fitting for classification tasks and transforms the target labels using LabelEncoder. It calls the fit method of _BaseVoting, indirectly invoking the code that needs to handle the None case for estimators. Therefore, identifying these spans will help in addressing the reported issue by adding a check for None estimators before calling their fit methods.",

From the provided file context and search results, the relevant code spans are the fit method in both _BaseVoting and VotingClassifier classes. The _BaseVoting.fit method needs to be adjusted to handle None estimators when sample_weight is provided. Specifically, the check for None estimators should be done before attempting to fit them with sample weights. The VotingClassifier.fit method inherits from _BaseVoting and also needs to be aware of this change. Additionally, the set_params method in _BaseVoting could be relevant for setting an estimator to None, which is indirectly related to the issue.
