The specific error is an `AttributeError` indicating that a `NoneType` object has no attribute `fit`. To address this issue, it is crucial to ensure that the `fit` method checks for `None` estimators before attempting to fit them with `sample_weight`.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, we observe that the `VotingClassifier` inherits from `_BaseVoting` and overrides its `fit` method. The `_BaseVoting.fit` method contains checks for the presence of `estimators` and their weights, but it does not explicitly check if an estimator is `None` before invoking `_parallel_fit_estimator`. This is likely the source of the error.\n\nIn the search results, the `_BaseVoting.fit` method appears in two files: once in the initial context and again in the search results under `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py`. The method code is consistent across both, which is good, but it lacks the necessary `None` check for each estimator before calling `_parallel_fit_estimator`.\n\nTherefore, the relevant code spans to focus on are the `fit` methods in both `VotingClassifier` and `_BaseVoting`. Modifying `_BaseVoting.fit` to include a check ensuring that no estimator is `None` before attempting to fit can resolve the issue. This does not require searching further; the solution can be implemented with the existing content.",
