Looking at the provided code, particularly the `_BaseVoting.fit` and `VotingClassifier.fit` methods, we see that the code attempts to fit all estimators without first checking if they are None. The relevant spans to address this issue are the 'fit' methods in both `_BaseVoting` and `VotingClassifier`. Additionally, the `set_params` method in `_BaseVoting` is relevant as it sets the parameters for the estimators, which might include setting one to None. These methods need to be modified to handle None estimators properly, especially when sample weights are provided.",
