The search results contain the implementation of the VotingClassifier and its parent class _BaseVoting. The fit method in _BaseVoting iterates over the estimators, cloning and fitting them in parallel. However, it does not explicitly check if an estimator is None before attempting to clone and fit it. This is likely the source of the error mentioned in the issue. As a result, relevant code spans include the fit method in _BaseVoting where the parallel fitting occurs, and the initialization of VotingClassifier. Further, the fit method in VotingClassifier inherits and uses the fit method from _BaseVoting, which also must be considered. These are the key areas where a check for None estimators and handling of sample weights are essential to resolve the reported issue.",
