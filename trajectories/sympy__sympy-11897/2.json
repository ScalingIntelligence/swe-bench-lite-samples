The issue examples include examples of inconsistent LaTeX printing output compared to the pretty printed output. The relevant search results pertain to the LaTeX printer and how it handles multiplication expressions, represented by the `_print_Mul` method in the `LatexPrinter` class. This method is responsible for formatting multiplication expressions in LaTeX, and it seems to be the key location where the consistency issue might be addressed. Additionally, the issue mentions that assumptions should not affect printing. The `LatexPrinter` class has a method `_print_Mul` that could be adjusted to ensure consistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers. The presence of other languages' printers (like MathML, Str, and Code printers) handling `_print_Mul` suggests a pattern in how these printers handle the printing of multiplication operations. However, the direct and most relevant class to address the inconsistency issue is `LatexPrinter`.",

The provided examples show that the LaTeX printer and pretty printer produce different outputs for certain mathematical expressions. The LaTeX printer is expected to match the output of the pretty printer unless it can produce a better output with LaTeX-specific features. The search results include relevant code spans from both the LaTeX printer and pretty printer in the SymPy codebase. These spans focus on the printing of multiplication expressions (`_print_Mul`) and powers (`_print_Pow`) which are key to the examples provided (like `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`). The code for handling the LaTeX and pretty representations of these expressions can be found in the `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` methods of the `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes respectively. These methods are responsible for converting the mathematical expressions into their string representations in LaTeX and pretty formats. Analyzing these methods will help in identifying and potentially resolving the inconsistencies described in the issue report.",
