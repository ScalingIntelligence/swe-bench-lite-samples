Specifically, the LaTeX printer sometimes formats expressions in a way that differs from the pretty printer, even though it should mirror its output unless providing a clearer LaTeX-specific representation.\n\n2. The provided code spans from `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` are relevant to the LaTeX and pretty printing processes respectively. The methods `LatexPrinter._print_Mul` and `LatexPrinter._print_Pow` from the LaTeX printer handle how multiplications and powers are formatted in LaTeX, which can affect the reported inconsistencies.\n\n3. Similarly, `PrettyPrinter._print_Mul` and `PrettyPrinter._print_Pow` from the pretty printer deal with how multiplications and powers are displayed in a more human-readable format. Comparing these methods between the LaTeX and pretty printers may help identify discrepancies causing the reported inconsistencies.\n\n4. The assertions in the issue suggest that assumptions about variables (like positivity) should not affect printing output. This might indicate a divergence in handling such assumptions between the LaTeX and pretty printers, warranting further investigation.\n\nConsidering these points, the identified code spans appear to be directly relevant to addressing the reported issue, as they involve critical aspects of expression formatting that are sources of the inconsistencies mentioned.",

These methods handle the rendering of powers and multiplications, which are key elements in the reported issue examples. Notably, the PrettyPrinter's _print_Pow method includes handling for negative exponents and roots, which is relevant to discrepancies mentioned in the LaTeX output. The LatexPrinter's _print_Mul method also addresses rendering fractions and multiplications, which is crucial for understanding and resolving the inconsistencies.

These methods are responsible for printing multiplication and power expressions respectively, and it's evident that discrepancies arise in how fractions and powers are handled between the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer. For instance, the LaTeX printer is using 'frac' for fractions while the pretty printer uses a different notation, as can be seen from the '_print_Mul' and '_print_Pow' methods in both files. Therefore, it seems that all major relevant files and methods have been identified and examined. Further investigation into assumption handling is suggested to ensure that assumptions on variables do not affect printing consistency.",
