The LaTeX printer should ideally produce the same output as the pretty printer unless LaTeX can provide a better representation. There are discrepancies in the output of the LaTeX and pretty printers for specific expressions such as `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`. Several files are provided that are relevant, notably `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, which contain the major printing classes. The search should focus on these files and any other related printing modules to identify where the discrepancy arises.",

Specifically, the issue involves the LaTeX printer not always producing the same output as the pretty printer, especially in cases involving expressions such as exponentials and logarithms. The key elements to focus on are the `_print_Mul` and potentially other similar methods across different printer classes that handle the LaTeX printing of expressions. The search results provide a comprehensive view of these methods in various printer classes such as `LatexPrinter`, `MathMLPrinter`, `StrPrinter`, `CodePrinter`, `JuliaCodePrinter`, `OctaveCodePrinter`, and `MCodePrinter`. However, the most relevant code spans are likely those within `LatexPrinter`, particularly the `_print_Mul` method, as this directly addresses the printing of multiplication expressions, which are central to the reported issue. Additionally, the `latex` function is relevant for overall LaTeX printing, ensuring that the settings and method calls adhere to consistent output standards. The current context does not provide additional context beyond the issue, so the focus should be on the methods and functions directly involved in LaTeX printing within the provided results.",
