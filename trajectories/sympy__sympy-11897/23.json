The examples provided show differences in the output of expressions when printed using LaTeX and pretty printing. The key focus is on ensuring that the LaTeX printer should produce the same output as the pretty printer, unless LaTeX can provide a better output. The search results include relevant code spans from 'LatexPrinter' and 'PrettyPrinter' classes. I should identify and extract the spans that are directly related to printing expressions to LaTeX and pretty formats. The spans '_print_Mul' and '_print_Pow' are particularly relevant as they handle how multiplication and exponentiation are printed in both formats. Additionally, I should ensure that assumptions do not affect printing, which is another subtle point mentioned in the issue. After reviewing, I believe the identified spans directly address the core of the reported issue and provide a sufficient context for the problem at hand.",
