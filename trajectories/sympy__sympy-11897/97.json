The inconsistencies are observed in the formatting of mathematical expressions, such as exponential and logarithmic functions, as well as rational expressions. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the methods responsible for printing these specific types of expressions in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` files. By targeting these methods, we can pinpoint where the discrepancies arise and adjust the LaTeX printer to match the output of the pretty printer when appropriate, while also considering if LaTeX-specific enhancements could be applied.",

The examples provided show differing outputs for the same expressions, specifically in handling of multiplication and powers. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle these expressions in both the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer. By examining the search results, we can see that the LaTeX printer uses the _print_Mul and _print_Pow methods. The like methods in the PrettyPrinter called _print_Mul and _print_Pow. Both these methods handle the printing of multiplication and powers respectively. To ensure consistency, it appears that there might be logic within these methods that is not aligned, such as how fractions and negative exponents are handled.
