To address this, it's necessary to focus on the LaTeX printing logic in the `latex.py` file and the pretty printing logic in the `pretty.py` file, specifically the methods dealing with expressions like `Mul` and `Pow`.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the inconsistency between the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer in SymPy. Specifically, the issue mentions that the LaTeX printer should match the output of the pretty printer unless better LaTeX output is possible. Examples provided show discrepancies in how expressions are printed, particularly with `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`. Both the LaTeX printer and pretty printer are involved in these inconsistencies.\n\nFrom the search results, the relevant sections of code are those that handle the printing of `Mul` and `Pow` expressions in both the `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes. The `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` methods in `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` are particularly relevant as they define how multiplication and power expressions are converted to LaTeX and pretty string formats, respectively. The logic in these methods must be carefully examined to ensure consistency between LaTeX and pretty printed outputs.\n\nThe search results provide a detailed look into how these methods process expressions. For instance, `LatexPrinter._print_Mul` involves creating LaTeX strings for both the numerator and the denominator of expressions. It uses settings like `fold_short_frac`, `long_frac_ratio`, and `mul_symbol_latex` to control the formatting. Meanwhile, `PrettyPrinter._print_Mul` handles the pretty printing of multiplication, including special handling for rational numbers and powers. Similarly, `LatexPrinter._print_Pow` and `PrettyPrinter._print_Pow` focus on power expressions, with the latter handling special cases like square roots and fractional exponents differently.\n\nBoth sets of methods should align to ensure the reported issue of inconsistency is addressed. The identified code spans provide a foundation for further analysis and potential modifications to ensure that the LaTeX and pretty printed outputs are consistent unless better LaTeX output can be produced.",
