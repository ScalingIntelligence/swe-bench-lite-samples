  "initial_message": "LaTeX printer inconsistent with pretty printer\nThe LaTeX printer should always give the same output as the pretty printer, unless better output is possible from LaTeX. In some cases it is inconsistent. For instance:\n\n``` py\nIn [9]: var('x', positive=True)\nOut[9]: x\n\nIn [10]: latex(exp(-x)*log(x))\nOut[10]: '\\\\frac{1}{e^{x}} \\\\log{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'\n\nIn [11]: pprint(exp(-x)*log(x))\n -x\n\u212f  \u22c5log(x)\n```\n\n(I also don't think the assumptions should affect printing). \n\n``` py\nIn [14]: var('x y')\nOut[14]: (x, y)\n\nIn [15]: latex(1/(x + y)/2)\nOut[15]: '\\\\frac{1}{2 x + 2 y}'\n\nIn [16]: pprint(1/(x + y)/2)\n    1\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2\u22c5(x + y)\n```\n\n"
