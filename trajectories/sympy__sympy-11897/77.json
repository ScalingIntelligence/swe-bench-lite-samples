The examples show that the LaTeX printer outputs '\\frac{1}{e^{x}} \\log{\\left (x \\right )}' for exp(-x)*log(x), while the pretty printer outputs '\u212f \u22c5log(x)'. Similarly, for 1/(x + y)/2, the LaTeX printer gives '\\frac{1}{2 x + 2 y}', whereas the pretty printer gives '1/(2\u22c5(x + y))'. This inconsistency suggests a need to review and potentially align the logic in the LaTeX printer's methods, especially those handling expressions like Mul, Pow, and Add, with the equivalent methods in the pretty printer. Additionally, it appears that assumptions like setting a variable as positive do not affect the pretty printer, but they do for the LaTeX printer, raising a secondary issue of whether assumptions should influence printing at all. To address these inconsistencies, a thorough examination of the _print_Mul and _print_Pow methods in the LatexPrinter class alongside their counterparts in the PrettyPrinter class is necessary to ensure consistent output across both printing styles.",
