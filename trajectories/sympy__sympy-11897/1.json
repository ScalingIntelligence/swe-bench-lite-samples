The inconsistencies observed in the examples suggest a need to align the printing logic in these files, particularly for expressions involving Multiplication (`Mul`), Power (`Pow`), and Exponential (`exp`). Therefore, the search should concentrate on these specific classes and methods within the printing modules.",

The code spans provided from 'sympy/printing/latex.py' and 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py' contain relevant classes and methods that handle the printing of LaTeX and pretty representations of SymPy expressions. I have identified 'LatexPrinter' and its methods '_print_Mul' and '_print_Pow' as relevant for handling the LaTeX printing of multiplications and powers, which directly relate to the reported issue. Similarly, in 'sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py', the class 'PrettyPrinter' and its methods '_print_Mul' and '_print_Pow' are relevant for handling the pretty printing of multiplications and powers. These methods will be crucial for ensuring consistency across the two printing methods. By comparing and potentially adjusting these methods, the inconsistencies observed can be addressed.",
