Specifically, it notes discrepancies in how certain mathematical expressions are printed in LaTeX compared to their pretty printed counterparts. The issue is exemplified with the expression `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the LaTeX and pretty printers that handle the printing of these expressions. We have detailed search results from `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. In `latex.py`, the `LatexPrinter` class and the methods `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` are of particular interest as they are responsible for generating LaTeX output.\n\nIn `PrettyPrinter` class of `pretty.py`, the methods `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` are relevant as they generate the pretty printed output. Both classes have methods for handling multiplications and exponentiations, which are central to the examples given in the issue. By analyzing these methods, we can determine if there are discrepancies in how the expressions are handled and identify the code spans that need to be reviewed or modified to ensure consistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers. This includes examining how variables, exponents, and operations are processed and formatted in both printers.",
