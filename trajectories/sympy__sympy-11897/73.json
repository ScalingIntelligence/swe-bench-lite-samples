Specifically, the LaTeX printer should produce the same output as the pretty printer unless LaTeX offers a superior representation. Two examples are provided where the LaTeX printer's output differs from the pretty printer's. One example involves the expression exp(-x)*log(x), and the other involves 1/(x + y)/2. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the LaTeX and pretty printers that handle the printing of these expressions. This involves examining the _print_Mul and _print_Pow methods in both the LatexPrinter and PrettyPrinter classes. The LaTeX printer seems to handle fraction folding and bracket inclusion differently, particularly in the _print_Mul method, which could be the source of the inconsistency. The PrettyPrinter methods, on the other hand, implement the direct printing of these expressions without the complexity of fraction folding. By comparing these methods, we can identify areas where the LaTeX printer might need adjustment to align more closely with the pretty printer's output.",
