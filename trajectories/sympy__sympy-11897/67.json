The key functions to focus on are '_print_Mul' and '_print_Pow' as these are likely responsible for printing LaTeX representations of multiplication and power expressions, respectively. Upon examining the 'LatexPrinter' class, I noticed methods '_print_Mul' and '_print_Pow' which suggested they handle LaTeX printing for such expressions. The '_print_Mul' function seemed particularly relevant due to its handling of fractions and multiplication, which align with the reported issues. '_print_Pow' is also relevant for handling power expressions found in the examples. Given the extensive detail in the '_print_Mul' function, it seems crucial for addressing the inconsistency in LaTeX printing for fractions. Thus, I identified the specific spans within 'sympy/printing/latex.py' that are most relevant to the reported issues.",
