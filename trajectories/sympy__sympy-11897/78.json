The examples provided show discrepancies in the printed output of mathematical expressions. Key areas of focus are the handling of multiplication and powers, especially where assumptions or settings might be affecting the output. The LatexPrinter class and its methods, particularly _print_Mul and _print_Pow, are relevant as they directly deal with converting SymPy expressions into LaTeX format. These methods need to be analyzed for potential biases or inconsistencies caused by settings such as mul_symbol_table, fold_short_frac, and long_frac_ratio. Additionally, the logic around handling fractions and negative exponents in _print_Mul and _print_Pow should be examined to ensure it aligns with the pretty printer's output. Based on the issue description, the relevant spans include the definition of LatexPrinter, its initialization settings, and the specific implementations of _print_Mul and _print_Pow.",
