To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes that handle the printing of `Mul` and `Pow` expressions. We should focus on the methods `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` in both `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes. These methods are responsible for generating the LaTeX and pretty string representations of `Mul` and `Pow` expressions, respectively. By comparing these methods, we can identify any inconsistencies or areas where the LaTeX printer deviates from the pretty printer.
