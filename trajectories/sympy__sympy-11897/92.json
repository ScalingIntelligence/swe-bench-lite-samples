This indicates that there may be issues with the LaTeX printer's implementation, particularly in how it handles expressions involving multiplication and exponentiation. Upon examining the provided code spans in `sympy/printing/latex.py`, I've identified functions `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` within the `LatexPrinter` class are directly related to the printing of expressions involving multiplication and exponentiation, respectively. These functions could potentially contain the logic that leads to the inconsistent behavior described in the issue. Given the specific examples provided in the issue, notably `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`, it suggests that the inconsistencies might be rooted in how these functions handle fractions, negative exponents, and possibly assumptions about variable positivity. Therefore, these are the code spans I've identified as relevant to the reported issue.",
