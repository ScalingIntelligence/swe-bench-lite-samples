The search results include relevant code spans from `LatexPrinter._print_Mul` and `LatexPrinter._print_Pow` in `sympy/printing/latex.py`, which handle the LaTeX rendering of multiplication and power expressions, respectively. Notably, these spans deal with formatting fractions and handling powers, aligning closely with the issue's focus on inconsistent LaTeX printing for mathematical expressions. Additionally, the comparison with the pretty printer output in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` provides a reference for expected consistent formatting in the pretty printer output.
