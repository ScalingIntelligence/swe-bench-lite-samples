These methods in both `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` capture the logic unique to each printer type, which is critical for identifying and potentially rectifying the inconsistencies.

Additionally, update the LaTeX printer's `_print_Pow` method to handle powers similarly to the pretty printer's `_print_Pow` method.\n\nThe task involves updating two methods in the LatexPrinter class. To handle fractions, the _print_Mul method needs modifications to align with the pretty printer's logic related to fractions. The instruction is unclear about which specific lines handle fractions as it's a broad instruction to align logic. However, looking at the code, the block that directly deals with fractions includes lines 393 to 434. For powers, the instruction is to update the _print_Pow method; however, the provided code snippet does not include this method. Given the task's scope, only the fraction-handling part in _print_Mul from lines 393 to 434 is relevant based on the provided code.",
