The LaTeX printer should ideally match the pretty printer, but with enhancements where LaTeX-specific features can provide better output. The search results contain relevant code spans from `sympy/printing/latex.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. From `latex.py`, the `LatexPrinter` class and its methods `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` are significant as they handle the LaTeX representation of multiplication and powers, which are central to the examples given. From `pretty.py`, the `PrettyPrinter` class and its `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` methods are identified as they produce the pretty printed output, which serves as the reference for comparison with LaTeX output. These methods need to be inspected closely to ensure alignment in printing expressions unless LaTeX can provide a clearer or more functionally specific output. The task appears to be tracking the logic within these specific methods to find potential mismatches or opportunities for improvement.",
