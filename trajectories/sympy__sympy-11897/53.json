To address this, we need to investigate the `_print_Mul`, `_print_Pow`, and `_print_Function` methods in the `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes. Additionally, we should look into the `latex` and `pretty` functions to ensure they handle expressions consistently. The examples provided in the issue suggest differences in how LaTeX and pretty printers handle multiplication, powers, and logarithmic functions. We should focus on these specific areas to find and fix the inconsistencies.",
