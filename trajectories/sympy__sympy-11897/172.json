The search results provide critical insights into the LaTeX printing implementation, focusing on the LatexPrinter class and its methods. Notably, the methods _print_Mul and _print_Pow are especially relevant, as they handle the LaTeX representation of multiplication and exponentiation, respectively. These methods are responsible for converting SymPy expressions into their LaTeX representations. The analysis of these methods reveals that they contain logic for handling fractions, negative exponents, and special symbols for multiplication. This context is crucial for addressing the inconsistencies noted in the issue, particularly where the LaTeX output differs from the pretty printed output, suggesting a need for alignment or improvement in the LaTeX printing logic.",
