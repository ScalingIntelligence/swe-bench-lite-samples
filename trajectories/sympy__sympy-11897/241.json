To address this, I analyzed the `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes in the search results. The key differences lie in how each printer handles the rendering of expressions involving `Mul` (multiplication), `Pow` (power), and fractions. For instance, the `_print_Mul` method in `LatexPrinter` uses specific LaTeX formatting rules that differ from the pretty printer's output. Similarly, the handling of `Pow` objects by `_print_Pow` in `LatexPrinter` does not always align with the pretty printer's representation. This analysis indicates that the relevant methods to be addressed are `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` in both `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes to ensure consistent output.",
