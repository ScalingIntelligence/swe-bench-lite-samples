Specifically, there are differences in how they handle certain expressions like exponential and logarithmic functions, as well as rational expressions involving sums. Given the context provided, the most relevant files appear to be those for the LaTeX and pretty printers in the printing module. To resolve the issue, it's necessary to review and potentially adjust the methods in both the LaTeXPrinter and PrettyPrinter classes, especially those related to printing Mul, Pow, and other complex expressions. Additionally, ensuring consistency across different types of expressions without allowing specific assumptions to affect printouts is key.",
