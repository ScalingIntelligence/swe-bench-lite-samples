Specifically, it highlights cases where the LaTeX printer does not match the pretty printer, even though it should unless LaTeX provides a better output. The examples provided involve expressions like exp(-x)*log(x) and 1/(x + y)/2, where the LaTeX output differs from the pretty print output. I need to find the relevant code spans in the LaTeX and pretty printer classes that handle these types of expressions. This involves looking at the methods that handle printing of additions, multiplications, powers, and functions. After analyzing the search results, I identified several code spans in `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes that are relevant to the printing of these expressions. These include `_print_Add`, `_print_Mul`, `_print_Pow`, and `_print_Function` methods in both classes. The `_print_Mul` method in `LatexPrinter` appears to be particularly relevant, as it handles the case where the expression includes division, which is central to the examples given in the issue. Also, the `_print_Add` and `_print_Pow` methods in both classes could affect the printing of these expressions, considering they involve operations like addition and exponentiation. The code spans identified need to be examined in the context of the provided examples to determine if they indeed account for the inconsistencies observed.",
