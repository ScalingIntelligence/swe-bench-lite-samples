The task involves identifying the relevant sections of code in the LaTeX and pretty printers that handle these expressions to ensure consistent output. Upon reviewing the search results, the most relevant code spans are those in `LatexPrinter._print_Mul` and `LatexPrinter._print_Pow` for the LaTeX printer, and similarly, `PrettyPrinter._print_Mul` and `PrettyPrinter._print_Pow` for the pretty printer. These sections directly deal with the printing of multiplication and power expressions, which are central to the inconsistencies described in the issue.
