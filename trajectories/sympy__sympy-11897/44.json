The goal is to identify the code responsible for these printers and compare their implementations to find where they diverge. The provided file snippets suggest that the printers are implemented across multiple files in the 'sympy/printing' directory. We should focus on the 'latex.py' and 'pretty.py' files, specifically on the methods handling multiplication (_print_Mul), power (_print_Pow), and functions like _print_expint for exponential integrals. Additionally, the assumption that printing should be unaffected by variable assumptions suggests a check on how variables are handled in these printers.",

Specifically, the LaTeX output does not consistently match the pretty printer output, which should be aligned unless LaTeX provides a better alternative. The provided search results include code spans from both the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer, making it possible to evaluate the consistency and potential improvements needed. The analysis involves comparing the methods for printing mathematical expressions in both LaTeX and pretty formats.\n\nKey points identified from the issue include:\n- The LaTeX output for `exp(-x)*log(x)` is `'\\frac{1}{e^{x}} \\log{\\left (x \\right )}'`, while the pretty printer output is `' -x\\n\u212f  \u22c5log(x)'`.\n- The LaTeX output for `1/(x + y)/2` is `'\\frac{1}{2 x + 2 y}'`, while the pretty printer output is `'    1\\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\\n2\u22c5(x + y)'`.\n- The issue suggests that assumptions should not affect printing.\n\nFrom the search results, the code spans that are relevant to addressing these inconsistencies are:\n- `LatexPrinter._print_Mul` and `LatexPrinter._print_Pow` in `sympy/printing/latex.py`.\n- `PrettyPrinter._print_Mul` and `PrettyPrinter._print_Pow` in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`.\n\nThese methods are responsible for rendering multiplications and powers in both LaTeX and pretty formats, respectively.
