These inconsistencies could be due to different handling of mathematical notations and expressions in the respective printers. To address this, it's crucial to focus on the methods responsible for printing mathematical expressions in both the LaTeX and pretty printers. Key methods to check include `_print_Mul`, `_print_Pow`, and others that handle rendering specific types of expressions. Additionally, since there's a mention of assumptions potentially affecting printing, it might be beneficial to investigate how variable assumptions affect the printing process.",

The examples provided show differences in the output of the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer for certain expressions involving multiplication and exponentiation, specifically when handling negative exponents and rational exponents. The search results contain code spans from various printers, including LaTeX, pretty, math, and others, that handle the printing of multiplication and powers. These spans are relevant because they deal directly with the formatting of expressions in LaTeX and pretty formats, which is the focus of the reported issue. The comparison between LaTeX and pretty printing in the provided examples can be traced to the methods `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` in the `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes, respectively. These methods are responsible for generating the LaTeX and pretty string representations of expressions. The identified code spans within these methods are critical for addressing the issue, as they handle the conversion of mathematical expressions into their textual LaTeX representations. It's essential to thoroughly review all the identified spans to ensure that the printing of expressions is consistent and accurate across both printers.",
