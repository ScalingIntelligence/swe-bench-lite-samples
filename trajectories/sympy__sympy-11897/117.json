To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the printing of Mul and Pow expressions. In the LaTeX printer, the methods '_print_Mul' and '_print_Pow' are crucial for generating LaTeX output for multiplication and power expressions, respectively. Similarly, in the pretty printer, '_print_Mul' and '_print_Pow' are responsible for generating pretty-printed output for these types of expressions. These methods need to be aligned to ensure that both printers produce consistent outputs. Additionally, the assumptions about variables (like 'positive=True') should not affect the printing. The code spans identified for these methods will help understand and potentially rectify the inconsistencies.",
