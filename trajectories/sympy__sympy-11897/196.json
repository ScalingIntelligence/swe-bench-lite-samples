Specifically, the LaTeX printer should match the pretty printer's output unless LaTeX can provide a better output. I've examined the code spans in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file, focusing on the `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` methods, as these methods are crucial for generating LaTeX representations of mathematical expressions. The analysis reveals that the `_print_Mul` method in the `LatexPrinter` class handles the printing of multiplication expressions and is also responsible for handling fractions through the use of the `sympy.simplify.fraction` function. The `_print_Pow` method handles the printing of power expressions, including special cases for square roots and other rational exponents. These methods are the primary candidates for adjusting to ensure consistency with the pretty printer's output. Further examination and modification of these methods, especially how they handle negative exponents and fractions, could resolve the inconsistencies mentioned in the issue. Additionally, understanding how the `PrettyPrinter` in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` handles similar expressions compared to `LatexPrinter` could provide insights for a targeted fix.",
