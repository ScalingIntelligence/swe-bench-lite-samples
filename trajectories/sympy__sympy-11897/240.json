Specifically, there are discrepancies in the output of LaTeX and pretty print for expressions involving exponentials and logarithms, as well as fractions. To address this, we need to locate the implementation of these printers and check how expressions like `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2` are handled. We should focus on the `latex` and `pretty` functions and their respective methods for printing `Mul` and `Pow` since these are the expressions that are causing inconsistencies.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue highlights inconsistencies between the LaTeX and pretty printers in SymPy. Specifically, the issue points out that the LaTeX printer should match the pretty printer unless LaTeX offers a better solution. Two examples are given where the LaTeX output differs from the pretty printer output. The first example involves the expression exp(-x)*log(x), where the LaTeX printer produces '\\frac{1}{e^{x}} \\log{\\left (x \\right )}' while the pretty printer shows '\u212f^(-x)\u22c5log(x)'. The second example covers 1/(x + y)/2, where the LaTeX printer outputs '\\frac{1}{2 x + 2 y}' compared to the pretty printer's '1/(2\u22c5(x + y))'. From the search results, several key methods in `LatexPrinter` class seem relevant to these issues: `_print_Mul`, `_print_Pow`, and possibly other methods responsible for printing specific types of mathematical expressions (e.g., `_print_Mod`, `_print_divisor_sigma`). Similarly, in the `PrettyPrinter` class, methods like `_print_Mul` and `_print_Pow` are expected to be relevant, as they handle printing of Multiply and Power expressions, respectively. Given the examples, the focus should be on aligning the handling of such expressions in both printers. Additionally, the issue mentions that assumptions should not affect printing, which implies that the printing methods should be independent of the variable assumptions. Overall, the identified code spans in both `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes, especially those dealing with `Mul` and `Pow` operations, are likely to be directly relevant to resolving the reported issue.",
