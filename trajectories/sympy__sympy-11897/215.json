The goal is to identify the relevant parts of the code responsible for these inconsistencies. Given the detailed information, it's clear that the focus should be on the LatexPrinter class and its methods, as well as the PrettyPrinter class. Specifically, methods like `_print_Mul`, `_print_Pow`, and `_print_Add` are likely involved. Additionally, the `latex` function in the `latex.py` file and the `pretty` function in the `pretty.py` file are central to the printing processes. It's important to delve into these specific areas for an accurate fix.",
