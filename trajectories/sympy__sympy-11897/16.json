To address this, we need to focus on the methods responsible for printing expressions in both LaTeX and pretty formats. Specifically, we should look into methods like `_print_Mul`, `_print_Pow`, and others that are used to format mathematical expressions in these printers. Additionally, the issue mentions that assumptions such as positivity should not affect printing, so we need to ensure that the printing logic is consistent regardless of assumptions.",

The examples provided in the issue highlight discrepancies in the printing of mathematical expressions, specifically concerning the handling of exponential and logarithmic functions, and the representation of rational expressions. Thus, the relevant code spans to examine are those involving the printing of `Mul`, `Pow`, and `Mod`, as well as any functions that might be overriding or affecting the default behavior of these types when converted to LaTeX format. Additionally, the initialization and settings of the `LatexPrinter` should be considered to ensure alignment with pretty printing, especially concerning the handling of expressions like 'exp(-x)*log(x)' and '1/(x + y)/2'. The analysis should ensure that assumptions do not affect printing, a concern mentioned in the issue.\n\nFrom the search results, the identified code spans provide various methods within the `LatexPrinter` class that handle different mathematical expressions and their LaTeX representation. The methods `_print_Mul`, `_print_Pow`, `_print_Mod`, and others are directly related to the printing of multiplication, power, and modulus operations, which are central to the expressions demonstrated in the issue. In contrast, the corresponding methods in the `PrettyPrinter` class (`_print_Mul`, `_print_Pow`) show how these expressions are handled in the pretty printing environment, offering a basis for comparison to detect and rectify inconsistencies. The initialization and settings of `LatexPrinter` (in `LatexPrinter.__init__`) also provide context on how the printer is configured, which could influence the printing outcome.",
