The LaTeX printer should ideally match the output of the pretty printer unless LaTeX-specific enhancements can be made. The specific examples provided show differences in the way LaTeX and pretty printers handle expressions involving multiplication and division, particularly when dealing with negative exponents and fractions. Given these examples, the relevant code spans to address this issue would likely be found in the methods responsible for printing multiplication (_print_Mul) and potentially other methods that format expressions for LaTeX output. The search results include the definition of the LatexPrinter class and its _print_Mul method, which seems highly relevant as it directly handles the LaTeX printing of multiplication expressions, which are pivotal in the examples given. The method includes logic for handling negative coefficients, fractions, and different settings that might be influencing the LaTeX output. By examining and potentially adjusting this method, one could aim to align the LaTeX output more closely with the pretty printer's output.",
