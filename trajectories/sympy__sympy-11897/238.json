The issue specifically highlights discrepancies in how expressions like 'exp(-x)*log(x)' and '1/(x + y)/2' are printed. This implies I should look for the functions responsible for printing expressions in both formats - LaTeX and pretty. In the search results provided, the spans of interest are: 'LatexPrinter._print_Mul', 'LatexPrinter._print_Pow', 'LatexPrinter._print_Function' for LaTeX printing and 'PrettyPrinter._print_Mul', 'PrettyPrinter._print_Pow', 'PrettyPrinter._print_Function' for pretty printing. These functions directly handle the printing of mathematical expressions in their respective formats, making them key to resolving the inconsistency issue. Additionally, I should check the handling of fractions and exponents, as the examples given involve these elements. The code involves decisions like when to use parentheses, how to represent fractions, and how to handle exponents, which are crucial to ensure consistency between the two printers.
