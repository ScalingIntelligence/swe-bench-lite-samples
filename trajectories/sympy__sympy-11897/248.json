This issue involves the handling of mathematical expressions such as `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`. The LaTeX printer should ideally produce output identical to that of the pretty printer, provided LaTeX does not offer a superior alternative. The main concern here is the consistency of the output between the two printers. \n\nFrom the search results provided, it's evident that the discrepancies might stem from different methods used by the `LatexPrinter` and `PrettyPrinter` classes to handle expressions like `Mul` and `Pow`. For instance, the `LatexPrinter._print_Mul` method shows a detailed process of converting a `Mul` expression into its LaTeX representation, considering factors like numerators, denominators, and even handling fractions differently for inline mode. In contrast, the `PrettyPrinter._print_Mul` method focuses on how the multiplication is rendered textually in a pretty format. \n\nAdditionally, the handling of `Pow` (power) expressions in both printers differs, which could also contribute to the inconsistency observed. The LaTeX printer's method for `Pow` involves detailed checks for rational exponents and the way they are printed, which might diverge from the simple textual representations done in the pretty printer.\n\nThe identified code spans are crucial for addressing the inconsistencies by ensuring that both printers handle similar expressions in a harmonized manner. Further investigation and possibly adjustments could be made in these sections to refine the output from both printers to be more consistent with each other.",
