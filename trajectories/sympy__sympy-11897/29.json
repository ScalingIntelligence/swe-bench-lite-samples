These methods are responsible for formatting multiplications and powers in LaTeX and pretty formats, respectively. The inconsistencies mentioned in the reported issue likely stem from differences in how these methods handle the same mathematical expressions.\n\nBy examining the code spans identified, we can pinpoint the sections that need adjustment to ensure consistency between the LaTeX and pretty printers.

  "initial_message": "LaTeX printer inconsistent with pretty printer\nThe LaTeX printer should always give the same output as the pretty printer, unless better output is possible from LaTeX. In some cases it is inconsistent. For instance:\n\n``` py\nIn [9]: var('x', positive=True)\nOut[9]: x\n\nIn [10]: latex(exp(-x)*log(x))\nOut[10]: '\\\\frac{1}{e^{x}} \\\\log{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'\n\nIn [11]: pprint(exp(-x)*log(x))\n -x\n\u212f  \u22c5log(x)\n```\n\n(I also don't think the assumptions should affect printing). \n\n``` py\nIn [14]: var('x y')\nOut[14]: (x, y)\n\nIn [15]: latex(1/(x + y)/2)\nOut[15]: '\\\\frac{1}{2 x + 2 y}'\n\nIn [16]: pprint(1/(x + y)/2)\n    1\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n2\u22c5(x + y)\n```\n\n"
