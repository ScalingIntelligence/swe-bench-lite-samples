The relevant code spans identified include methods handling LaTeX and string printing for expressions involving multiplication (`_print_Mul`) and power (`_print_Pow`) operations in various printer classes (LatexPrinter, StrPrinter). These methods implement the logic for converting SymPy expressions into LaTeX and string representations, respectively. The provided code snippets show how these methods differ in handling fractional powers and negative exponents, which directly relate to the inconsistencies observed in the output comparisons provided in the issue. Further examination of these methods and their settings, particularly those influencing the printing of mathematical operations in LaTeX and string formats, would be necessary to resolve the reported inconsistencies. The current context likely needs to focus on refining the logic within these specific methods to ensure consistency across printers and improve LaTeX's suitability for mathematical typesetting where applicable.",
