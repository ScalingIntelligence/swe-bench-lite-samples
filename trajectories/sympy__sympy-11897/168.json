However, given examples show discrepancies in their representation of expressions involving exponentials, logarithms, and fractions. To debug and potentially fix this, we should focus our search on classes and functions related to the LaTeX and pretty printing in the SymPy library. We are particularly interested in the LatexPrinter and PrettyPrinter classes and their respective methods for handling expressions like Mul, Pow, and others that are involved in the discrepancies observed. We should also look at how assumptions might be affecting printing, although the issue explicitly states that assumptions should not affect printing.",
