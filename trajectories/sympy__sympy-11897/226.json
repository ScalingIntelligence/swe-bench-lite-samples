To address this, we need to focus on the methods in the LatexPrinter class that handle the printing of Add, Mul, and Pow expressions, as these are the operations involved in the examples provided. Specifically, we should look at _print_Add, _print_Mul, and _print_Pow in the LatexPrinter class to see if they handle the expressions differently than their counterparts in the PrettyPrinter class. Additionally, we should check if assumptions about variables (like positivity) are affecting the printing, which is indicated by the user. The PrettyPrinter class also has methods for printing Add, Mul, and Pow, named _print_Add, _print_Mul, and _print_Pow, respectively. By comparing these methods in both classes, we can identify where the inconsistency arises.",
