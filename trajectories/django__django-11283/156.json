The error message indicates an attempt to recreate existing entries in the auth_permission table, which violates a unique constraint. This suggests that the migration system might be failing to correctly identify or handle proxy models, leading to this duplication error. The analysis of the search results reveals relevant code spans in two files: 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' and 'django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py'. In 'autodetector.py', the methods 'generate_created_proxies' and 'generate_deleted_proxies' are relevant as they deal directly with the creation and deletion of proxy models during migrations, which aligns with the reported issue. These methods could be where the duplication error originates from. In 'management/__init__.py', the 'RenameContentType' class and its methods are related to managing content types, which could also be implicated in the error if renaming models or handling their content types during migration isn't done correctly. Overall, these code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue as they deal with the aspects of Django's migration system that could cause the observed error.",

When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available \u200bhere):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on \u200bdjango-users and was asked to report this here.\n"
