The error message indicates a duplicate key value violation for the 'idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq' constraint, specifically for the 'add_agency' codename. This suggests that the migration is trying to re-create entries in the 'auth_permission' table that already exist. The user has already attempted several troubleshooting steps, including updating from different Django versions and deleting entries from the database associated with renamed models, all without resolving the issue. The search results provided include code spans related to migrations, permissions, and proxy models. The relevant code spans include those from 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py', which handles the detection of changes for migrations, and 'django/contrib/auth/models.py', which defines the 'Permission' model and its 'unique_together' constraint on 'content_type' and 'codename'. However, the most pertinent code spans are likely those within 'django/db/migrations/autodetector.py' that deal with the generation of created and deleted proxy models, as well as the handling of unique constraints. These spans are identified as 'MigrationAutodetector.generate_created_proxies' and 'MigrationAutodetector.generate_deleted_proxies' within the search results, indicating how Django attempts to manage the creation and deletion of proxy models during migrations, which could be related to the issue at hand.",

When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available \u200bhere):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on \u200bdjango-users and was asked to report this here.\n"
