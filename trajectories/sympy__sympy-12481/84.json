Specifically, when `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` is called, it raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The expected behavior is to apply the cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation.\n\nExamining the code in the `Permutation.__new__` span, it is evident that the current implementation checks for duplicate elements in the cycles and raises an error if any are found. This occurs in the section where it flattens the `args` and checks for duplicates using `has_dups(temp)`. This is likely the cause of the reported issue.\n\nFor solving the issue, modifications are needed in the handling of non-disjoint cycles, particularly the part that raises the `ValueError`. It should be adjusted to apply non-disjoint cycles in a specified manner without raising an error. The relevant portion of the code for this adjustment is within the `Permutation.__new__` method where the duplicate check occurs.\n\nThus, the identified relevant code span is `Permutation.__new__`, where modifications should be made to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately.",
