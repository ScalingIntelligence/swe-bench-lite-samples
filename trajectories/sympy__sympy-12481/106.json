The task is to modify the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation without raising an error. The relevant sections of the code are the constructor `Permutation.__new__` and the `Permutation.cyclic_form` property. The constructor currently checks for disjoint cycles and raises an error if duplicates are found. To address the issue, we need to modify the constructor logic to process non-disjoint cycles correctly. The `Permutation._af_new` method is also relevant for constructing a new permutation from an array form. The search results confirm the presence of these methods and provide additional context for the `Permutation` class.",

The code spans identified (`Permutation.__new__` and `Permutation._af_new`) are crucial as they deal with the creation and validation of permutations. The new search results also include the `Permutation.__new__` method, which is where the error occurs due to the non-disjoint cycle check.\n\nTo address the issue, the `Permutation.__new__` method should be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order.
