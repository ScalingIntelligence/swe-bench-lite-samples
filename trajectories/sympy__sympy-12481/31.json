The task is to identify relevant code spans that deal with the `Permutation` constructor and cycle handling. The search results contain several spans, but the most relevant one is the `Permutation.__new__` method which validates the input arguments and raises the `ValueError` if the arguments are not valid sequences. This span directly deals with the input validation for the `Permutation` constructor, making it highly relevant to the reported issue. The other spans, such as `Permutation._af_new` and `Permutation.list`, are also relevant as they handle the internal representation and transformation of permutations, but they do not directly deal with the validation or handling of non-disjoint cycles.",

Specifically, it requests that the constructor should handle such cycles by applying them in left-to-right order to form the resulting permutation instead of raising a `ValueError`. The current implementation in `Permutation.__new__` raises such an error when cycles are non-disjoint. Key sections to examine are how cycles are processed and how they interact with the `array_form` of the permutation. The relevant spans identified include the constructor itself (`Permutation.__new__`) where the error is raised, and the section that processes cycles (`is_cycle`). Additionally, the `Cycle.list` method and `Permutation.list` method could be relevant for understanding how cycles are transformed into a list form used in the permutation. Finally, `Permutation._af_new` is crucial for creating a new permutation instance from the processed array form. Note that `Cycle` class and its methods are also relevant as they are used within the `Permutation` class for handling cycles.",

The `Permutation.__new__` method handles the creation of a new `Permutation` object, and the `Cycle.__init__` method initializes a `Cycle` object. Both methods currently raise a `ValueError` if the cycles are non-disjoint. To resolve the issue, these methods need to be modified to process non-disjoint cycles appropriately.
