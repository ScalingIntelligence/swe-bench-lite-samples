The constructor currently raises a `ValueError` when it encounters non-disjoint cycles. The task is to modify this behavior to apply the cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. The relevant code spans to address this are the constructor method `__new__` and the static method `_af_new`, which handles the creation of a new `Permutation` object. The `__new__` method is responsible for validating and processing the input arguments, including the cycles. Adjustments will need to be made to ensure that non-disjoint cycles are processed correctly without raising an error. Additionally, the `cyclic_form` property is relevant as it transforms the permutation's array form into a cyclic notation, which may also need to be adjusted to accommodate non-disjoint cycles.",
