Reviewing this span, especially the part where duplicates (non-disjoint elements) are checked using 'has_dups(temp)' and the ValueError is raised if found, shows the direct relevance to the issue. Understanding the current context and preview of code given suggests that modified handling of non-disjoint cycles could potentially resolve the issue without needing to examine other spans or parts of the code.
