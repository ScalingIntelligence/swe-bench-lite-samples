Specifically, it should apply the cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation, rather than raising a `ValueError`. The relevant code spans to address this issue are those that handle the initialization and processing of cycle inputs in the `Permutation` class. This involves understanding how the `__new__` method processes inputs and how it identifies and handles cycles. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the cycles, which suggests a straightforward modification to apply the cycles as specified in the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those specifically dealing with the processing of cycle inputs and the handling of duplicate elements.\n\nAfter reviewing the provided code, the `Permutation.__new__` span seems directly relevant to the issue as it includes the logic for initializing a `Permutation` object from various types of inputs, including cycles, and the current logic that raises the `ValueError` for non-disjoint cycles. This is where the modification to handle non-disjoint cycles as described in the reported issue should be implemented. As no other code spans in the provided context directly address the initialisation and handling of cycles, this span is the only one required to implement the necessary changes. Thus, the analysis indicates that this span is sufficient to proceed with the requested modification.",
