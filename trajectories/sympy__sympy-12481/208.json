Specifically, the constructor should apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation, instead of raising a `ValueError`. The relevant code spans should be analyzed to determine where this validation occurs, and how the cycles are processed and stored. The specific code spanning from 'Permutation' class definition to the validation check within the `__new__` method are critical in understanding how non-disjoint cycles are handled currently. Additionally, this class should likely be modified to accommodate the new behavior. The provided search results show the relevant parts of the `Permutation` class, especially the validation steps for cycle inputs. Relevant code spans include those from the base class declaration to the validation for repeated elements. These should be examined and potentially modified to implement the requested functionality.",
