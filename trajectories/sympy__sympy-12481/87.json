The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are detected. The task is to modify this behavior to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. To address this issue, it's crucial to identify and focus on the part of the code that processes cycles and checks for disjointness. The code spans in the provided search results that are relevant include the `Permutation.__new__` method where the cycle processing and error raising happen (at spans labeled `e` and the following error raising block). This is the primary place where modifications will be needed to allow for the construction of permutations from non-disjoint cycles as specified in the issue. Other parts such as the imports and class definition are important context but do not directly address the reported issue. Therefore, the `Permutation.__new__` span is the primary focus for identifying relevant code.",
