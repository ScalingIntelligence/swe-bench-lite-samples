However, the current implementation raises a `ValueError` for non-disjoint cycles. The relevant code spans are those that deal with the construction and processing of cycles within the `Permutation` class. Specifically, the `Permutation.__new__` method handles the creation of new `Permutation` instances and should be modified to check for non-disjoint cycles and apply them correctly. Additionally, the `Permutation._af_new` method is used to create a new instance of `Permutation` from an array form, which will also be involved in the process of applying these cycles. The `Permutation.cyclic_form` property could also be relevant for understanding how cycles are currently being processed and could potentially be used to implement the desired behavior for non-disjoint cycles. Finally, the `Permutation.__repr__` method, while not directly related to the issue at hand, provides context on how permutations are represented and could be indicative of current handling of cycles in the system.",

If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.\n"
