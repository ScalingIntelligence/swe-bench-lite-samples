The current implementation raises a `ValueError` for such inputs, but the requirement is to handle them by applying the cycles in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. The relevant code spans to consider are the `Permutation.__new__` method, which is responsible for validating and constructing the permutation, and the `Permutation._af_new` method, which is used to create a new permutation instance from an array form. Additionally, the `Permutation.cyclic_form` property and its related methods should be reviewed to ensure they correctly handle and represent the permutation's cycles. The `Permutation.__repr__` method is also relevant for debugging and understanding how the permutation is represented. By identifying these spans, we can pinpoint the areas of code that need to be modified or extended to support the handling of non-disjoint cycles as specified in the issue.",
