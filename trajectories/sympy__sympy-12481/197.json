The user expects that the constructor should handle non-disjoint cycles gracefully, applying them in left-to-right order to produce a valid permutation instead of raising a `ValueError`. Currently, the code within the `__new__` method checks for disjoint cycles and raises an error if non-disjoint cycles are detected. The goal is to modify this behavior. By examining the provided code spans, I identify several relevant sections. The span labeled 'Permutation.__new__' contains the main logic for constructing the `Permutation` object from input arguments, including the handling of cycles and the error checking for non-disjoint elements. This is where the changes need to be implemented to process non-disjoint cycles appropriately. The other spans, such as 'Permutation', 'imports', and 'impl', provide context for the module setup and class definition, but they do not directly handle the constructor's input processing or error checking. Thus, the focus should be on the 'Permutation.__new__' span for any modifications or additions.",
