The expectation is that the constructor should handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. The primary focus should be on the file `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, specifically looking into the `Permutation` class and its constructor (`__new__` method) to address how it handles cycle inputs. Additionally, considering the reference to handling cycles in a left-to-right order, the `rmul` or `rmul_with_af` methods might also be relevant for processing multiple cycle inputs in the required manner. Since the issue specifically mentions `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])`, the constructor implementation directly or indirectly dealing with such input should be the primary target.",

The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided, but the desired behavior is to apply these cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. To address this, it's important to identify the constructor and any helper functions that handle cycle input. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the creation of a `Permutation` object from cycle data (`Permutation.__new__` and `Permutation._af_new`). These methods can be adjusted to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly by merging them in the specified order before constructing the permutation. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that any validation or error handling related to cycle inputs is updated to accommodate this change in behavior. While some functions like `Permutation.cyclic_form` might also indirectly relate to the issue by handling cycles, the primary focus for addressing the reported issue should be on the constructor methods. Furthermore, the `Permutation.print_cyclic` attribute might be relevant for the final integration testing of the solution to ensure the correct display of permutations including those formed with non-disjoint cycles. However, its direct relation to the core problem is less significant compared to the constructor methods. Thus, the identified spans `Permutation.__new__` and `Permutation._af_new` are the most crucial for addressing the issue.",

The existing code already has functionality to handle cycles and check for disjointness, as seen in the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class where it checks for repeated elements in the cycles and raises a `ValueError` if any are found. To address the issue, the code needs to be adjusted to merge non-disjoint cycles correctly, which would likely involve modifying the logic inside the `__new__` method where the checks for repeated elements occur.\n\nThe relevant code spans are primarily those dealing with the creation and manipulation of permutations, particularly the `__new__` method where the error is raised and the static method `_af_new` which finalizes the creation of a `Permutation` instance. These sections are: 'Permutation.__new__' where the non-disjoint cycles are detected and an error is thrown, and 'Permutation._af_new'. These sections need modification to incorporate the new functionality for handling non-disjoint cycles, possibly including addition of a method to apply the cycles left-to-right ignoring their non-disjoint nature. It's also relevant to note that other parts of the code involving permutation operations like 'Permutation._hashable_content', 'Permutation.__repr__', etc., can influence the display and management of permutations, but their change is less critical for addressing the main issue at hand.",

From the provided code, the `Permutation.__new__` method is responsible for creating a permutation instance. It currently raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the cycles, which aligns with the observed behavior. To address the issue, the method should be updated to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. The relevant code spans include the `Permutation.__new__` method and the `Permutation._af_new` method, which is used to create a new permutation instance from an array form.
