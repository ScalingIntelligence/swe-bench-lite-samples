Currently, the code raises a `ValueError` when encountering non-disjoint cycles, but the desired behavior is to apply them in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. I examined the relevant code spans in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` module, focusing on the `Permutation` class and its `__new__` method. The `__new__` method currently validates the input and raises a `ValueError` if it does not meet specific criteria, including likely checks for disjoint cycles that are not directly visible in the spans provided. To address the issue, modifications would need to be made in the `__new__` method's handling of input cycles to allow and properly apply non-disjoint cycles. The provided spans include the constructor and the static method `_af_new`, which could be involved in constructing the permutation with non-disjoint cycles. Additional spans define properties and methods related to cyclic representation (`cyclic_form`, `full_cyclic_form`), suggesting these could be areas where processing non-disjoint cycles might appropriately occur. Given the issue's specifics, reviewing these spans would help determine how best to modify the current behavior to support the new functionality.",
