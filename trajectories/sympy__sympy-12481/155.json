The existing code in the `Permutation.__new__` method already handles various types of input, including cycles, but currently raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the input cycles. To address the issue, the code should be modified to resolve non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order rather than raising an error. The relevant code span to modify is the section that checks for duplicate elements and raises the `ValueError`. This section is critical for implementing the desired functionality of handling non-disjoint cycles by resolving them in order and constructing the resulting permutation.
