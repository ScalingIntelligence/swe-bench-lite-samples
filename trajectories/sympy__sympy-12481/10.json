The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided, specifically in the section marked 'e' where it checks for duplicates (`has_dups(temp)`). This duplication check is the source of the error. Instead, the issue suggests applying the cycles in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation, even if they are non-disjoint. To implement this, we need to modify the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles differently. We need to find the relevant part of the code where this validation occurs and the part where the permutation is actually constructed. The spans of code that deal with the validation of cycles and the construction of the permutation from the cycle representation should be identified as relevant.",

The issue is about handling these non-disjoint cycles correctly, which means modifying how cycles are processed or merged. Since the current constructor does not handle non-disjoint cycles as expected, further modification is required to fix this issue.
