The search results from `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` provide the relevant code for the `Permutation` class and its constructor method. Specifically, the `__new__` method is where the creation of a `Permutation` object is handled. This method currently raises a `ValueError` if non-disjoint cycles are detected, which aligns with the issue description. To address the issue, the code needs to be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles in a left-to-right order, instead of raising an error. However, the current `__new__` method does not have the necessary logic to resolve non-disjoint cycles; this logic needs to be implemented. The relevant code spans are the `Permutation.__new__` and the `Permutation` class declarations.",
