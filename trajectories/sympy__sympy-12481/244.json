The current implementation raises a `ValueError` instead of handling non-disjoint cycles appropriately. The key sections of code to examine are those related to the `Permutation` constructor and the handling of cycles. Notably, the `Permutation.__new__` method is where the initial checks and creation of the permutation object occur. Additionally, the `Permutation.cyclic_form` property is relevant as it processes the cyclic form of the permutation, which could be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles. The search results provide a comprehensive view of the `Permutation` class, including its constructor, properties, and methods for handling permutations. These sections of code are crucial for identifying and implementing the solution to the reported issue. The identified spans include the constructor (`Permutation.__new__`), the static method for creating a new permutation from an array form (`Permutation._af_new`), and the property for retrieving the cyclic form of a permutation (`Permutation.cyclic_form`).",
