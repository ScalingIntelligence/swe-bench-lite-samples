The user expects that if the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned. The relevant code spans are those that handle the creation of a `Permutation` object and the processing of its arguments, including how cycles are handled and validated. The `Permutation.__new__` span is where the bulk of this functionality resides. It processes the input arguments, checks for disjointness of cycles, and forms the permutation array. To address the reported issue, the logic for handling non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation.__new__` method should be adjusted to meet the user's expectation.",
