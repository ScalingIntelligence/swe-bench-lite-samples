To address the issue, we need to modify the `Permutation.__new__` method to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in the left-to-right order and then creating the permutation. The relevant code spans are the ones handling the input arguments and the check for non-disjoint cycles, along with the logic for forming the permutation from the cycles.
