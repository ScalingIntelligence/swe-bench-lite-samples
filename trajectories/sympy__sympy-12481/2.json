Specifically, it should combine non-disjoint cycles in a left-to-right order rather than raising a `ValueError`. The current implementation in the `Permutation.__new__` method raises a `ValueError` when there are non-disjoint cycles detected, which aligns with the current behavior but not with the requested functionality. To address this, the method needs to be modified to process such cycles appropriately. Given the provided search results, the relevant span of code is `Permutation.__new__`, which includes the logic for handling cycle inputs and checking for duplicates that lead to the `ValueError`. This span contains the core functionality for constructing a `Permutation` object, which is directly related to resolving the issue at hand. Therefore, it is essential to focus on this span and identify modifications required to handle non-disjoint cycles.",

The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when there are repeated elements in the cycles. The task is to modify the `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately, applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation instead of raising an error.\n\nFrom the provided context and search results, the `Permutation.__new__` method is the main area of focus. This method currently checks for non-disjoint cycles and raises a `ValueError` if any are found. The challenge is to change this behavior. We also need to ensure that the cycles are applied correctly in the order they are provided.\n\nThe `Cycle` class is also relevant as it handles the creation and manipulation of cycles. Specifically, the `Cycle.__init__` method and the `Cycle.__call__` method could be used to merge cycles if necessary.\n\nThe identified code spans include:\n- `Permutation.new`: The constructor method where the error is raised.\n- `Cycle.__init__`: The initializer for the `Cycle` class, which could be modified to handle merging of cycles.\n- `Cycle.__call__`: This method is used to call a `Cycle` object and could be relevant for applying cycles in order.\n\nTo address the issue effectively, these methods will need to be adjusted to handle non-disjoint cycles properly without raising an error.

  "initial_message": "`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles\nCalling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.\n"
