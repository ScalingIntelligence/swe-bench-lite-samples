Specifically, the error occurs when passing non-disjoint cycles like `[[0,1],[0,1]]`, which currently raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation as expected. The goal is to modify the behavior so that if non-disjoint cycles are passed, they are applied in left-to-right order, effectively allowing multiple cycles to act on the same element, and returning the resulting permutation. The relevant classes and methods likely reside within the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file, particularly focusing on the `Permutation` class.",

The issue specifies that the permutation should be constructed in left-to-right order if the cycles are non-disjoint. This implies modifications in the `Permutation.__new__` method where the input cycles are processed. Additionally, it is mentioned that the current implementation raises a `ValueError` for non-disjoint cycles, which should be changed to handle such cycles properly.\n\n1. Analyzing the `Permutation.__new__` method, it is observed that there are checks for non-disjoint cycles and they currently raise a `ValueError`. This part needs modification to resolve the cycles in left-to-right order.\n2. The `Cycle` class and its methods such as `__call__` and `__init__` are also relevant since they define how cycles are handled and may need adjustments to support the new behavior.\n3. The `Permutation.cyclic_form` method is important as it processes the array form into cyclic form, and understanding how it handles cycles will be crucial.\n4. Reviewing the search results, it is noted that several utility functions like `_af_rmul`, `_af_rmuln`, and `_af_pow` are present, which might be useful for implementing or modifying the behavior of permutation operations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are identified as follows: `Permutation.__new__`, `Cycle.__call__`, `Cycle.__init__`, and `Permutation.cyclic_form`. These sections will need modifications to correctly handle non-disjoint cycles according to the reported issue.",

The current design prevents the construction of permutations with non-disjoint cycles by raising a ValueError. To address the issue of allowing non-disjoint cycles, modifications would likely need to be made around the cycle input handling section of the `__new__` method to apply these cycles in left-to-right order and combine their effects without raising an error. However, specific implementations for combining non-disjoint cycles or modifying the existing handling logic are not present in the provided file context.

There is a specific check for duplicate elements within the input, which currently raises a `ValueError` if present, indicating that non-disjoint cycles are explicitly disallowed at this point. To address the issue properly, it appears necessary to modify this behavior to process overlapping cycles from left to right. Additionally, while the `cyclic_form` property is used to convert the permutation to its cycle form and is stored sorted for future reference, there may be room to improve how cycle inputs are handled to achieve the desired functionality for non-disjoint cycles. Since no utility functions that directly address this specific task were found within `permutations.py`, it may be advisable to explore other files within the `sympy/combinatorics/` directory that might contain related functionalities, especially those dealing with cycle combinations or permutations, in order to identify potential starting points for a solution.",
