The constructor currently fails when non-disjoint cycles are provided, specifically when called with `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])`. The desired behavior is to accept non-disjoint cycles, apply them in left-to-right order, and return the resulting permutation. This suggests the need to adjust the constructor's behavior to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately.",

The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided, but the issue suggests that non-disjoint cycles should be processed in left-to-right order to construct the resulting permutation. To address this, we need to identify the part of the code responsible for processing cycles in the `Permutation` constructor and the methods that handle cycle application. In the provided file context, we see the `Permutation.__new__` method which includes checks for disjoint cycles and raises the `ValueError`. Additionally, the `_af_rmuln` function, which is used for multiplying permutations in array form, could be relevant for applying cycles in the required order. The new search results include the `Permutation.rmul_with_af` method, which uses `_af_rmuln` for multiplication in array form. This suggests that modifying the `Permutation.__new__` method to use `_af_rmuln` for cycle application in the presence of non-disjoint cycles could be a solution. The relevant code spans are those in `Permutation.__new__` that handle cycle input and the `_af_rmuln` function.",
