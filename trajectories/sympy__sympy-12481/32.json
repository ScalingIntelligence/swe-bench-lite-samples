This method currently handles the creation of a `Permutation` instance and includes checks for disjoint cycles and other validation steps. These steps need to be adjusted to accommodate non-disjoint cycles as specified in the issue.\n\nI am identifying the following code spans within the `Permutation.__new__` method as relevant to the reported issue:\n\n- The entire `__new__` method code as it provides the core logic for constructing the permutation.\n- Specifically, the block of code that checks for repeated elements and raises a `ValueError` if found (related to disjoint cycles).\n\nUnderstanding the current implementation and considering the requirement to modify the handling of non-disjoint cycles, these spans are critical for implementing the necessary change without introducing additional issues.",
