The constructor should not raise a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided but should instead apply them in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. To address this, the `Permutation.__new__` method in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file is the primary candidate for modification. The method currently raises a `ValueError` if cycles have repeated elements (`has_dups(temp)` check), which needs to be modified. The `is_cycle` flag in the method indicates whether the input is a cycle, and the subsequent handling of cycles needs to be adjusted to accommodate non-disjoint cycles. Additionally, the method sets the array form (`aform`) based on the cycles, which should be computed considering the non-disjoint nature of the cycles.",
