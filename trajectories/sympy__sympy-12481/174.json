The current behavior raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided, but the desired behavior is to apply these cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. The relevant files identified are primarily within the `sympy/combinatorics` directory. The focus should be on the `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` to find the constructor and modify it to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately.",

The `__new__` method definition should be examined for how it processes the input, specifically whether it checks for disjoint cycles and how it constructs the permutation. Additionally, the `cyclic_form` property and related methods may be relevant if they handle cycle representation or application. The `Permutation` class spans provided include `Permutation.__new__`, `Permutation._af_new`, `Permutation.list`, `Permutation.cyclic_form`, `Permutation.full_cyclic_form`, and others that might be involved in cycle processing or permutation construction.
