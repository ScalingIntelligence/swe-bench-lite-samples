The problem is that calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a ValueError instead of constructing the identity permutation. The desired behavior is to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. To address this, I will search for the implementation of the Permutation constructor and related methods that handle cycle inputs.",
