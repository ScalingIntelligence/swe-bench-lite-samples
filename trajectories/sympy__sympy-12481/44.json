Specifically, it is mentioned that `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The expected behavior is that non-disjoint cycles should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned. \n\nTo address this, we need to identify the relevant sections of code that deal with the constructor and the handling of cycles. The `Permutation.__new__` and `Permutation._af_new` methods are likely candidates as they involve the initialization of the `Permutation` object and the array form conversion, respectively. These methods should be examined to ensure that non-disjoint cycles are handled correctly without raising an error.\n\nAdditionally, the `Permutation.cyclic_form` property and related methods like `full_cyclic_form`, `support`, and `transpositions` might also be relevant as they deal with the cyclic representation of permutations, which is closely related to the input cycles provided to the constructor. By examining these sections, we can ensure that the input cycles are processed correctly and the expected permutation is constructed.\n\nAfter analyzing the search results, the identified code spans include the constructor (`__new__`) and the array form conversion (`_af_new`). These sections are crucial for handling the input and initializing the permutation correctly. By focusing on these sections, we can determine if the current implementation correctly handles non-disjoint cycles and ensure the reported issue is addressed.",
