The current behavior raises a 'ValueError', but the desired functionality is to handle such cycles by applying them in left-to-right order to construct the resulting permutation. The analysis of the provided search results shows that the 'Permutation' class and its constructor ('__new__') are central to addressing this issue. The '__new__' method currently processes input arguments and either constructs a new 'Permutation' instance or raises an error if the input is invalid. The spans of code relevant to cycle handling and permutation construction have been identified, as they are crucial for modifying the behavior to accommodate non-disjoint cycles without raising errors. These identified spans include the '__new__', '_af_new', and 'Cycle.__init__' methods. Additionally, the handling of cycles within the 'Permutation' class, particularly the 'list' and 'cyclic_form' methods, are relevant as they directly interact with cycle data. Thus, these identified sections of code should be the focus for implementing the required changes.",
