The current implementation raises a `ValueError` due to the presence of duplicated elements in the cycles, which doesn't align with the user's expectation for the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. This suggests a need to modify the `Permutation.__new__` method to handle such cases differently, potentially bypassing the duplicate check for cycles and applying them as specified. The identified relevant code spans include the entire `Permutation.__new__` method as it contains the logic for handling the creation of permutations from cycles, including the current error-raising behavior for duplicate elements. Additionally, the imports section is relevant as it includes necessary elements for the `Permutation` class implementation.",
