According to the issue, calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` should not raise a `ValueError` but should instead construct the identity permutation by applying the cycles in left-to-right order. The current implementation in the `Permutation.__new__` method currently raises a `ValueError` if non-disjoint cycles are detected. This is evident in the part of the code that checks for duplicates in the cycle representation and raises an error if found. To address the issue, the `Permutation.__new__` method needs to be updated to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately instead of raising an error. The relevant code span is the `Permutation.__new__` method where this error is raised.",
