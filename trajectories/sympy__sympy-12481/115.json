From the provided search results, the relevant code span is the `Permutation.__new__` method. This method handles the creation of new `Permutation` instances and currently includes logic to raise a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are detected. To resolve the issue, the method should be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately. The identified span contains the logic that checks for duplicate elements (indicating non-disjoint cycles) and raises the `ValueError`.
