The requirement is to modify the `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order, which would result in the identity permutation in this case.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, the relevant code is located in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file. The constructor `Permutation.__new__` is responsible for the initialization of the `Permutation` class. Within this constructor, there is a validation step that checks for duplicate elements when the input is a list of cycles or a list of integers. If duplicates are found and the input is a cycle, it raises a `ValueError`. This is directly related to the reported issue.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the validation for non-disjoint cycles needs to be adjusted. Instead of raising a `ValueError`, the code should process these cycles in a specified order (left-to-right) and compute the resulting permutation. The current code does not support this behavior, hence the error. This part of the code is crucial for addressing the issue, and any modifications should ensure that non-disjoint cycles are handled correctly without raising an error.\n\nGiven the context and the reported issue, the relevant span id is 'Permutation.__new__', which contains the constructor method where the problem occurs.",
