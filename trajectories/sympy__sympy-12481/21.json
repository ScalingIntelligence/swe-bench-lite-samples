The error occurs when creating a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles, and the expected behavior is to apply these cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. The relevant file appears to be `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, where the Permutation class is defined. Focus should be on the method or logic where inputs are validated and the permutation is constructed.",

Specifically, `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The expected behavior is that non-disjoint cycles should be applied in left-to-right order to produce the resulting permutation.\n2. There is no current file context provided, so all analysis is based on the new search results.\n3. The search results contain several relevant spans of code within the `Permutation` class in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`.\n   - The `Permutation.__new__` span is particularly relevant as it contains the constructor logic that handles the initialization of a `Permutation` object. It includes checks for non-disjoint cycles and raises a `ValueError` if the argument is not valid. This is where the error is being raised.\n   - The `Permutation._af_new` span is relevant as it is responsible for creating a new `Permutation` object from an array form, which could be used to handle non-disjoint cycles.\n   - The `Permutation.list` span is also relevant as it converts the permutation to a list, which could be used in the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles.\n4. Based on the issue and the relevant code spans identified, further modifications should be made to the `Permutation.__new__` method to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately.",

If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.\n"
