Specifically, it mentions that the constructor fails when non-disjoint cycles are provided as input. The expected behavior, as described by the user, is that the cycles should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned, rather than raising a `ValueError`.\n\nUpon reviewing the code spans provided in the search results, it is clear that the relevant code spans are the ones contained within the `Permutation` class definition and the `Permutation.__new__` method. These spans include the conditions that check for input type and validity, including the check for non-disjoint cycles. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if non-disjoint cycles are detected, which aligns with the issue description.\n\nTo address the issue, the relevant code spans to be considered are those that deal with cycle input handling, specifically the section where duplicate elements in cycles are detected and the subsequent `ValueError` is raised. These are critical to understanding and potentially modifying to achieve the desired functionality.\n\nThe identification of these spans is crucial as they directly influence the behavior of the `Permutation` constructor with respect to non-disjoint cycles. Modifying or augmenting the logic within these spans would be necessary to meet the user's requirement.\n\nThus, the relevant spans for addressing the issue are those labeled within the `Permutation.__new__` method, particularly the handling of input arguments and the detection of duplicate elements among cycles.",
