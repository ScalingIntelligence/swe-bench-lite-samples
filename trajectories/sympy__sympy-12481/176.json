The current implementation in the `Permutation.__new__` method raises a `ValueError` when it detects non-disjoint cycles. To address the issue, we need to modify this behavior so that non-disjoint cycles are handled as specified. The relevant code spans to be modified are those where the check for non-disjoint cycles is made and where the `ValueError` is raised. This includes the sections labeled 'e' and 'f' in the `Permutation.__new__`, where the code checks for cycles and handles duplicate entries. Additionally, we need to adjust the logic to apply cycles in order if they are not disjoint. The current context does not have any previously identified files or spans.",
