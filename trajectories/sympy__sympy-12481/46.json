The relevant class is `Permutation` in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. Given that the constructor is mentioned in the issue, the focus should be on understanding how the `__new__` method in the `Permutation` class handles inputs like non-disjoint cycles. A search for the `__new__` method should be sufficient since this is where the object creation logic will be located. Additionally, a search for any logic handling non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` class or related utilities may help in addressing the issue.",
