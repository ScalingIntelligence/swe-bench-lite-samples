The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are encountered. The task is to identify the relevant code spans related to cycle handling in the `Permutation` class. Firstly, I examined the search results and focused on the `Permutation` class and related methods. The `Permutation.__new__` method is central to the creation of a `Permutation` and includes logic to handle different input types, including cycles. The `_af_rmul` and `_af_rmuln` functions are also relevant as they handle the multiplication of permutations, which could be involved in applying cycles. Additionally, the `Cycle` class and its methods are important, especially `Cycle.__init__` which initializes a cycle and checks for duplicates, which is related to disjointness and could be a place to modify to allow and handle non-disjoint cycles. Overall, these parts of the codebase seem to be the most relevant to address the reported issue.",
