The code provided in the search results contains the `Permutation` class, specifically the `__new__` method which is responsible for constructing a new instance of the `Permutation` class. This method currently raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the cycles, as determined by the `has_dups(temp)` check. \n\nTo address the reported issue, the `__new__` method should be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles properly, potentially by applying the cycles in left-to-right order and forming the resulting permutation without raising an error. The current implementation seems to specifically check for disjointness and raises an error if this check fails. The relevant code spans include the part of the `__new__` method where the error is raised (`if has_dups(temp)`) and the broader context in which cycle processing occurs (`if is_cycle` and related sections). By identifying these sections, we can pinpoint where the implementation needs adjustment to resolve the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans are those parts of the `__new__` method dealing with cycle input and error handling.",
