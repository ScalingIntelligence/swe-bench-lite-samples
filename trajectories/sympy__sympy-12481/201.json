The requirement is to modify the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. Currently, the constructor raises a `ValueError` when it encounters non-disjoint cycles, and the goal is to change this behavior. \n\nFrom the initial file context, it seems the `Permutation.__new__` method is the main focus. This method checks if the input is a sequence, specifically looking for disjoint cycles. If it detects non-disjoint cycles, it raises a `ValueError`. \n\nThe search results include various methods that operate on permutations: a direct left multiplication function `_af_rmul`, a multi-argument left multiplication function `_af_rmuln`, and several methods from the `Cycle` class such as `__call__`, `list`, `__init__`, and more. These methods, especially those in `Cycle` and the matrix operations in `_af_rmul` and `_af_rmuln`, seem relevant to modifying the cycle application process and could be used to implement the left-to-right application of cycles when they are non-disjoint.\n\nIt's also noted that other files, such as `free_groups.py`, `fp_groups.py`, `perm_groups.py`, `util.py`, and `tensor_can.py` have functions and classes that manipulate or use permutations, but none of these seem directly relevant to the specific issue of handling non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` constructor.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are mainly within the `Permutation` class and the `Cycle` class, with specific methods and functions that could be modified or referenced for handling non-disjoint cycles appropriately.",
