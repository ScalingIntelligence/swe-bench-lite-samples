According to the requirement, instead of raising an error, the constructor should accept non-disjoint cycles and apply them in left-to-right order to form the resulting permutation. The key elements to focus on in the code search results are the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class that handles the creation of permutations. We need to identify where the validation for disjoint cycles occurs and adjust it to compute the permutation result for non-disjoint cycles. \n\nFrom the search results, the relevant code span to focus on is the `Permutation.__new__` span, which contains implementation logic for checking cycles and constructing permutations. Specifically, the code raises a `ValueError` when it detects duplicate elements indicative of non-disjoint cycles. This is the part of the code that needs adjustment to align with the reported issue.\n\nThe scratch pad contains the thought process needed to identify and describe the relevant code spans for the `Identify` JSON instance based on the `json_schema` provided.

The relevant part of the code is within the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class. This method contains logic to handle different types of inputs and checks for the presence of duplicates in the input cycles. If there are duplicates (non-disjoint cycles), it currently raises a `ValueError`. The task requires modifying this behavior to process non-disjoint cycles correctly without raising an error, which aligns with the code provided. The code includes checks for cycle elements and raises a `ValueError` if non-disjoint cycles are detected. Since the specific logic to handle and resolve non-disjoint cycles is not implemented but the relevant code is identified (where the change should occur), the analysis concludes that the file context provided is relevant and sufficient to address the issue.",
