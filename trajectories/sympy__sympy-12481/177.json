The relevant code spans to focus on are the `Permutation` class definition, particularly the `__new__` method where the input validation and processing of cycles occur. The current implementation does not handle non-disjoint cycles as expected by the user, so this part of the code needs to be updated to address the issue. Additionally, the import statements and utility functions used within the `__new__` method, such as `has_dups`, `flatten`, and `Cycle`, should be reviewed to ensure they align with the desired functionality for handling non-disjoint cycles.",
