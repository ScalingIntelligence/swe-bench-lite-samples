Specifically, calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` should not raise a `ValueError` but should instead construct the identity permutation by applying the cycles in left-to-right order. The relevant code spans to start with are those dealing with the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class, where the constructor's logic resides. We need to focus on how the class processes the input cycles and how it handles non-disjoint cycles. Initially, the class currently raises a `ValueError` if cycles are not disjoint, which is what we need to change to meet the requirements of the reported issue. We will need to extract the function responsible for checking the disjoint condition and modifying it to apply cycles correctly even when they are not disjoint. This involves a detailed examination of the `__new__` method and related helper functions such as `Cycle` and `_af_new`.",

Specifically, calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The requirement is to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation.\n\n**Steps to Identify Relevant Code:**\n1. **Analyze User Instructions:** The issue requires handling non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` constructor. Compare this against the current implementation in `Permutation.__new__`, particularly the checks for cycles and handling of repeated elements.\n\n2. **Review Current Context:** The file context shows the `Permutation` class definition, focusing on the `__new__` method and the related static method `_af_new`.\n\n3. **Process New Search Results:**\n   - **Permutation Constructor:**\n     - **Span ID: 'Permutation.__new__':** This span is critical as it contains the logic for constructing a `Permutation` instance. Specifically, there's a portion that checks for repeated elements (cycles and elements), which should be modified to accommodate non-disjoint cycles.\n   - **Span ID: 'Permutation._af_new':** This static method is used to create a new `Permutation` instance from an array form, which might require checking for how non-disjoint cycles are converted to array form.\n\n4. **Identify and Extract Relevant Code Spans:**\n   - Focus on the `__new__` method's handling of arguments, specifically how cycles and repeated elements are managed. The current logic raises a `ValueError` for non-disjoint cycles, which needs to be changed to handle them smoothly.\n\n5. **Decision:** The constructor logic in `Permutation.__new__` must be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles without raising an error. Instead, it should compute the permutation by applying the cycles in left-to-right order.\n\n**Action:** Specifically, modify the `Permutation.__new__` method to include a check for non-disjoint cycles and apply them correctly without raising an error.\n\nThis approach aligns with the user's requirement of handling non-disjoint cycles effectively.",
