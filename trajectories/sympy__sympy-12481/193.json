The current implementation in the `Permutation.__new__` method explicitly raises a `ValueError` when there are repeated elements in the cycles, which corresponds to non-disjoint cycles in this context. To address the issue, the code needs to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. This requires modifying the `Permutation.__new__` method where the error is raised, possibly adding a new method or logic to handle non-disjoint cycles without raising an error and instead computing the resulting permutation.\n\n1. Import statements and class declaration identify the location of the `Permutation` class.\n2. `Permutation.__new__` method contains logic to handle different types of input for creating a permutation. It currently raises an error for non-disjoint cycles, which aligns with the reported issue.\n3. Other parts of the code relate to handling permutations, but they don't directly address the issue with non-disjoint cycles.\n\nRelevant code spans include the entire `Permutation.__new__` method where the error for non-disjoint cycles is raised and the place where the array form of the permutation is processed.",
