The current implementation in the `Permutation.__new__` method raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the input cycles. The task is to modify this behavior to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation instead of raising an error. The relevant code spans are identified around the section in `Permutation.__new__` where the error is raised in cases of duplicate elements in the cycles. Additionally, it is noted that the error message suggests resolving cycles using the `Cycle` class, which may need to be revisited to ensure appropriate handling of non-disjoint cycles. The modification should be made in the section of code labeled 'temp = flatten(args)' and the subsequent checks for duplicates, which currently raise the `ValueError`. The goal is to instead implement a method to handle the non-disjoint cycles effectively. No relevant files or spans have been previously identified, so the focus is on the provided search results to pinpoint the exact changes needed.",
