The expected behavior is for the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. The relevant code is likely in the initialization part of the `Permutation` class or in a method that processes the cycles. Initially, we should focus on the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file where the `Permutation` class is defined.",

Specifically, calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The expected behavior is to apply the cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. In the provided search results, the `Permutation` class and its methods are extensively detailed, including the `__new__`, `_af_new`, `cyclic_form`, and other relevant methods. Additionally, the `Cycle` class methods such as `__init__`, `__missing__`, `__iter__`, `__call__`, `list`, `__repr__`, `__str__`, `size`, and `copy` are present. These methods are crucial for understanding how permutations and cycles are handled, especially when it comes to creating and manipulating them. The `Permutation.__new__` method specifically checks for disjoint cycles and raises a `ValueError` if non-disjoint cycles are found. This is directly related to the reported issue. Modifying the `__new__` method to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order could solve the issue. Therefore, the identified code spans from the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file are relevant to addressing the issue.",

The issue specifically mentions that calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError`, suggesting that the code needs to handle non-disjoint cycles more gracefully. We should look for parts of the code that either validate or process cycle input for permutations. From the file context, we see that the `Permutation` class includes methods for handling the creation of permutations from cycles, including `__new__`, `_af_new`, and `cyclic_form`. These methods are critical for understanding how permutations are instantiated and how cycle forms are processed. In the search results, we see additional methods such as `__new__`, `_af_new`, and `cyclic_form` in the `Permutation` class which confirm our suspicion that these areas could be modified to address the issue. Specifically, the `__new__` and `cyclic_form` methods appear to be handling the conversion from cycle to array form and the generation of cyclic forms, respectively, which are directly related to the problematic input mentioned in the issue. We should focus on these methods to ensure they correctly process non-disjoint cycles without raising errors and potentially returning the correct identity permutation in such cases.",
