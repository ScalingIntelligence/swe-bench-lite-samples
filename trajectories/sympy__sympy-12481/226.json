The task is to identify code spans relevant to the handling of cycles in the Permutation constructor. The provided search results include several code spans within the Permutation class, particularly in the '__new__' method. This method is responsible for constructing a new Permutation instance. The spans labeled 'e' and 'f' are relevant because they deal specifically with cycle inputs. Span 'e' processes cycle inputs, while span 'f' handles instances of the Cycle class. Span 'a' to 'g' encompass various input checks and handling scenarios, including cases where a Cycle instance is passed. The 'temp' variable and its handling in the presence of duplicates (as in spans 'f' and 'e') are particularly relevant to the issue, as they pertain to handling disjointness. The current implementation raises a ValueError if there are repeated elements, which aligns with the issue described. For addressing the issue of non-disjoint cycles not being allowed, the relevant spans include 'e', 'f', and the entire '__new__' method for understanding context and making necessary adjustments.",

If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.\n"
