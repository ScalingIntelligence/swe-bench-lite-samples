Currently, the constructor raises a `ValueError` for such inputs. The task is to modify this behavior to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation instead. The relevant part of the code involves the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class, which is responsible for initializing instances of `Permutation`. This method includes checks and error handling for various types of inputs, including sequences of cycles. To address the issue, the `__new__` method must be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles gracefully, apply them in the specified order, and construct the permutation accordingly. The current implementation also includes utility methods like `cyclic_form` and `list` that might be useful for constructing and manipulating permutations.",
