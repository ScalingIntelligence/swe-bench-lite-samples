Specifically, it mentions that passing non-disjoint cycles should not raise a `ValueError` but instead, the cycles should be applied in left-to-right order to construct the permutation. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the cycles. This indicates that the relevant part of the code to focus on is the handling of cycles within the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class. The code should be modified to allow non-disjoint cycles and apply them correctly to form the permutation. Given the search results, the `Permutation.__new__` span seems highly relevant as it contains the logic for creating a `Permutation` instance from various types of input, including cycles. The current implementation performs a check for duplicate elements within the cycles and raises an error if any are found. This behavior needs to be adjusted according to the reported issue. Therefore, the identified span 'Permutation.__new__' is relevant and should be considered for further modification to address the issue.",
