The current code in the `Permutation.__new__` method raises a `ValueError` if it detects repeated elements in the input, which matches the problematic behavior described. The task is to identify the relevant code span that handles the validation of input cycles and determine if it should be modified to accommodate non-disjoint cycles. From the search results, the relevant code span is the one starting with the annotation 'e', where the input cycles are checked for repeated elements. This is the part of the code that needs to be adjusted to avoid raising the `ValueError` for non-disjoint cycles and to implement the described behavior.",
