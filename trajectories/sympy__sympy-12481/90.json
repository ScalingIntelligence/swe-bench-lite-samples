The relevant spans appear to be those defining the `Permutation` class and its constructor (`Permutation.__new__`), as well as any validation or normalization steps that might reject non-disjoint cycles. The constructor section (`Permutation.__new__`) is crucial because it initializes the permutation object and sets its size, which may include checks or transformations related to cycle inputs. Additionally, the method for creating permutations from array form (`Permutation._af_new`), which is called by the constructor, is relevant because it may influence how cycles are interpreted and stored. Therefore, the identified spans directly involve the core functionality impacted by the reported issue.",

If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.\n"
