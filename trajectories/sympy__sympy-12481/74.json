The solution should involve modifying the constructor in the `Permutation` class to handle non-disjoint cycles properly. Therefore, the search should focus on the `Permutation` class methods in the file `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` and specifically on the `__new__` method or any cycle parsing mechanism.",
