The task is to identify the relevant code span where this handling is implemented to understand if any alteration is needed. The provided code spans include the `__new__` method where this handling is done, specifically within the 'Permutation.__new__' span. This span contains the logic for handling different types of inputs and raises an error if duplicate elements are found in the input, indicative of non-disjoint cycles. To resolve the issue, likely changes need to be made within or around this span to handle non-disjoint cycles differently as per the user's requirement.

The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if non-disjoint cycles are detected.

These spans contain the logic for constructing a `Permutation` instance and handling the input cycles. The task is to modify this logic to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately, which should be implemented in the `__new__` method.
