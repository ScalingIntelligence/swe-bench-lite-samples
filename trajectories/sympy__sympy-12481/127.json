From the provided context, the `Permutation` class is defined in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` and includes a `__new__` method that likely handles the initialization of `Permutation` instances. Since the constructor fails due to non-disjoint cycles, the focus should be on this method to modify its behavior. Additionally, the `Cycle` class within the same file may also be relevant, especially if it involves logic related to cycle handling.",

To address the issue, the constructor should handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. The provided search results contain relevant code spans, particularly those related to cycle handling and the `Permutation` class. Notably, the `Cycle.__init__` span throws a `ValueError` for non-disjoint cycles, which should be modified. Additionally, the `Permutation.__new__` method should be updated to compute the resulting permutation from non-disjoint cycles. Other relevant spans include `Permutation.cyclic_form`, which is used to compute the cycle form of the permutation, and `Permutation.__repr__`, which is used for representation. These can be useful for testing and verifying the changes.",
