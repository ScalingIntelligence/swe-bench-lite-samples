The expected behavior should be constructing the identity permutation or applying the cycles in left-to-right order. The relevant files mentioned in the context suggest that the implementation is in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. Focusing on the `Permutation` class and its methods to identify where the constructor logic resides and how it handles cycles seems to be the right approach. Given the straightforward nature of the issue, it should be sufficient to look primarily into the `Permutation` constructor within the `permutations.py` file, and particularly within the `__new__` method.",

The search results reveal that the `Permutation` class and its methods are located in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. The relevant code spans include the constructor `Permutation.__new__` which appears to handle the initialization and the `Permutation._af_new` which constructs the permutation from an array form. Since the task requires detailed handling of the cycle inputs and their application in left-to-right order, particularly around the validation and processing of cycles, these identified parts of the code are pertinent. Additional methods like `Permutation.array_form` might also be relevant as they provide the ability to access and manipulate the internal state of the permutation in array form. These selections cater directly to the requirements of adjusting the constructor behavior and implementing the new functionality specified in the issue. Evaluating the search results based on the issue description, specific concerns regarding non-disjoint cycle are illuminated, and the current code setting appears appropriate to render modifications.",
