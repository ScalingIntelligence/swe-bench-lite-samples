Reviewed the code in sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py.\n2. Identified that the current implementation in the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class raises a `ValueError` when cycles are not disjoint.\n3. The relevant code spans are those that handle cycle input and determine if they are disjoint. Specifically, the block of code that checks for duplicates and raises the `ValueError` needs to be adjusted.\n4. Decided to include the entire `__new__` method as it is crucial for understanding how cycles are handled and how the permutation is constructed based on the cycle input.\n\nAction Plan: Extract the relevant spans and focus on the code handling cycle input and the error raising mechanism for non-disjoint cycles.",
