The provided search results contain the `Permutation` class definition and its `__new__` method, which is responsible for handling the construction of a `Permutation` object from various types of inputs, including cycles. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when duplicate elements are detected in the input, which corresponds to non-disjoint cycles as described in the issue. To address the issue, the code needs to be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles without raising an exception.
