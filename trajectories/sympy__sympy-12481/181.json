This suggests a need to modify the constructor's handling of cycles, particularly how it processes inputs and determines whether to raise an exception. By examining the provided code, it's clear that the constructor checks for duplicate elements (i.e., non-disjoint cycles) and raises a `ValueError` if any are found. To resolve the issue, the relevant code spans include the `Permutation.__new__` method where this validation occurs, which needs to be adjusted to process non-disjoint cycles correctly instead of raising an error. Additionally, understanding the broader context around the constructor\u2014such as the import statements and class definition\u2014will ensure a holistic solution. This approach requires careful modification of the code without causing other side effects, focusing on maintaining the integrity of the remaining codebase.",
