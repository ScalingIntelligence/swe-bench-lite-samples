The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when encountering non-disjoint cycles, but the desired behavior is to accept such cycles, apply them in left-to-right order, and return the resulting permutation. After analyzing the provided code, it is clear that the logic responsible for handling cycles is found within the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class. This method currently checks for disjoint cycles and raises an error if non-disjoint cycles are found. The task is to modify this logic to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately. No existing code handles non-disjoint cycles as required by the issue, so no relevant code spans are identified in the existing context. However, the `__new__` method is identified as the section where modifications are necessary to implement the required functionality. Therefore, the relevant code span to focus on is the one containing the `__new__` method.",

The search results also include the `Cycle` class which is relevant for understanding how cycles are managed in the context of permutations. Specifically, the `Permutation.__new__` method checks for disjoint cycles and raises a `ValueError` if duplicates are found. This directly relates to the issue of wanting to handle non-disjoint cycles gracefully by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. The identification of these specific code spans will help address the reported issue.",

The current implementation raises a ValueError when non-disjoint cycles are detected. The goal is to modify this behavior to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with cycle handling and permutation construction. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that the Permutation class's __new__ method is central to this issue as it contains logic for initializing permutations from cycles. Specifically, the part of the __new__ method that checks for non-disjoint cycles and raises a ValueError needs to be modified. Additionally, the Cycle class's __init__ method, which also raises a ValueError for non-disjoint cycles, is relevant for understanding and modifying cycle handling. Given these insights, the identified spans are crucial for implementing the required changes.",

If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.\n"
