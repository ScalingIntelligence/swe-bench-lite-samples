The issue specifies that calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. It suggests that if the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order, and the resulting permutation should be returned. The relevant code spans to address this issue would be those that handle the construction of the permutation, particularly the part where cycles are processed and checked for disjointness. The `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class is a likely candidate as it handles the initialization of the permutation object. Additionally, the `cyclic_form` property could be relevant as it deals with converting the permutation to a cyclic form, which might need adjustment to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately.",
