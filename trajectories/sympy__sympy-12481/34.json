The expected behavior is for the constructor to handle these cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. The current behavior raises a `ValueError`. To address this, I need to find the exact location in the code where the `Permutation` constructor is implemented and where the handling of cycles is defined. Given the context, it's likely in the 'permutations.py' file within the 'sympy/combinatorics/' directory.",
