The `Permutation` constructor currently raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided, but the desired behavior is to apply these cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation.

It specifically mentions that calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The goal is to modify the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation.\n\nI analyzed the code in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` and identified the relevant sections. The `Permutation.__new__` method is responsible for initialization and currently raises the `ValueError` mentioned in the issue when it encounters non-disjoint cycles. This method needs to be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately. Additionally, the `Permutation._af_new` method is used internally to create new permutation objects, which should support the changes made to the constructor.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those within the `Permutation.__new__` and `Permutation._af_new` methods, as these are directly involved in the creation and initialization of `Permutation` objects.",
