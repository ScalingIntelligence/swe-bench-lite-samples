Specifically, it mentions that calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. According to the issue, non-disjoint cycles should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned. This suggests a modification is needed in the `Permutation.__new__` method where it currently raises an error for repeated elements. The code currently checks for repeated elements in the `temp` list and raises a `ValueError` if any are found. To address the issue, the code should handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in the specified order and returning the correct permutation. I've identified the relevant span that likely needs modification to incorporate this functionality: 'Permutation.__new__'. Note that additional logic will likely need to be added within this method to resolve the issue.",
