The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if non-disjoint cycles are provided, but the desired behavior is to apply these cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. To address this, the relevant section of code to modify seems to be within the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class. This method is responsible for initializing a Permutation object and currently includes checks and raises errors for situations where there are repeated elements (non-disjoint cycles). To fulfill the new requirement, this part of the code would need to be adjusted to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in the specified order instead of raising an error. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the method continues to handle other edge cases and remain consistent in behavior.",
