The relevant code spans to address the issue are the `Cycle.__init__` method and the `Permutation.__new__` method. Both of these methods need adjustments to allow non-disjoint cycles and to apply them correctly. The `Permutation.__new__` method should also handle the cycles appropriately if they are non-disjoint.
