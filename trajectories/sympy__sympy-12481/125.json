The expected behavior is that non-disjoint cycles should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned, but instead, a `ValueError` is raised. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle cycle initialization and application within the `Permutation` class. These code spans will likely be found within the `__init__` and `__new__` methods of the `Permutation` class, as well as any helper methods or checks for cycle disjointness. After analyzing the provided search results, it's clear that the `Permutation.__new__` and `Permutation.__init__` methods are of particular interest, as they directly handle the creation and initialization of `Permutation` objects with provided cycle inputs.",

However, currently, it raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements, which means it doesn't handle non-disjoint cycles. To implement the desired behavior, we need to identify where and how to apply the cycles in left-to-right order, especially when they are non-disjoint. The `Cycle` class's `__call__` method seems relevant, as it applies one cycle to another, but further investigation is needed to determine if it can handle non-disjoint cycles effectively.",
