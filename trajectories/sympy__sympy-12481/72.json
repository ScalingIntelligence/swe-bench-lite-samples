The current implementation in `Permutation.__new__` raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are detected. The task is to modify this behavior to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. The relevant code spans include the constructor itself (`Permutation.__new__`), which checks for non-disjoint cycles and raises the error, and the `_af_new` static method, which creates a new `Permutation` instance from an array form. Additionally, methods related to permutation multiplication and power operations (`Permutation.rmul`, `Permutation.__pow__`, etc.) are potentially relevant if the changes affect how permutations are combined or handled. However, the core changes needed are in the `Permutation.__new__` method.",

The issue involves ensuring that non-disjoint cycles are processed correctly, applying them in left-to-right order, and constructing the resulting permutation without raising a `ValueError`. We should focus on the `Permutation.__new__` method, where the initialization of `Permutation` objects takes place. We also need to ensure that the handling of cycles is consistent and does not prohibit non-disjoint cycles. From the provided search results, we can see that the `Permutation.__new__` method includes checks for cycles and raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the cycles. This behavior needs to be modified to resolve the reported issue. Additionally, the `Cycle` class and its methods might also be relevant as cycles are commonly used in permutation operations.",
