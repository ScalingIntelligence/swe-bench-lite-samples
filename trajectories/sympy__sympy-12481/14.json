The expected behavior is to handle such cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. The most relevant code spans are those dealing with the creation and handling of cycles within the `Permutation` class. Specifically, the `__new__` method, which is responsible for constructing the permutation object and where the error likely originates, is key. Additionally, methods like `_af_new` for creating a new permutation from an array form and `cyclic_form` for managing the cyclic representation of the permutation are also relevant. These sections need to be examined and potentially modified to address the issue with non-disjoint cycles.\n\nIn examining the provided code, `Permutation.__new__` is the primary location where the creation of the permutation object occurs. This method should be checked for how it handles the input cycles and ensure they are processed in the required left-to-right order. If non-disjoint cycles are currently causing an error, this is the place to start addressing the issue.",

Specifically, calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The desired behavior is for non-disjoint cycles to be applied in left-to-right order, resulting in the correct permutation. To address this, we need to modify the `Permutation.__new__` method to handle non-disjoint cycles properly. We should also ensure that the `Cycle` class and its methods are reviewed to confirm they don't interfere with this new behavior. Additionally, we should check the `cyclic_form` property to ensure it correctly represents the permutation created from non-disjoint cycles. The current analysis shows that the `Permutation.__new__` method has code that raises a `ValueError` when there are repeated elements, which aligns with the observed behavior. We need to modify this logic to resolve overlapping cycles. The `Cycle.__init__` method currently raises an error if there are duplicate elements, so we may need to adjust this as well. The `cyclic_form` property should be reviewed to ensure it handles the resulting permutation correctly. The identified code spans include the `Permutation.__new__`, `Cycle.__init__`, and `Permutation.cyclic_form`, which collectively handle the construction, initialization, and representation of permutations and cycles. These spans seem relevant to resolve the issue reported.",

The `Permutation` constructor currently raises an error if non-disjoint cycles are provided, as indicated by the presence of `has_dups` checks and `ValueError` exceptions related to repeated elements. To address this, modifications should be made to the `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and determining the final permutation without raising an error. This could involve creating a utility method within the `Permutation` class or modifying the existing `Cycle` class to support merging of cycles regardless of disjointness. Additionally, reviewing how the `Cycle` class and its methods handle cycle operations will be crucial to ensure that the desired functionality of merging non-disjoint cycles is achieved.",
