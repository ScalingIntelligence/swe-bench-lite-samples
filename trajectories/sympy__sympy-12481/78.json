Currently, the provided implementation in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` raises a `ValueError` when there are repeated elements in the input cycles, which aligns with the behavior described in the issue. The relevant code spans to address this issue would be within the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class, especially the part where it checks for duplicate elements and raises the `ValueError`.
