Specifically, the issue is that when non-disjoint cycles are passed to the constructor, it raises a `ValueError` instead of handling the cycles in a left-to-right fashion and constructing the corresponding permutation. The key part of the code to look at is the `Permutation.__new__` method, which initializes the `Permutation` object. I noticed that in this method, there is a check for duplicate elements in the cycles with the `has_dups` function, which currently raises a `ValueError` if duplicates are found. However, according to the issue, this behavior should be changed to process the cycles in left-to-right order. Therefore, the relevant part of the code to address this issue is within the `Permutation.__new__` method where the error is raised for duplicate elements. This is where the changes need to be made to support processing of non-disjoint cycles without error.",
