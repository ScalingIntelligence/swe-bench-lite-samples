The search results further show the definition of the Permutation class and a static method _af_new for creating new instances of Permutation. The task is to identify the relevant code spans that might need to be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles. The _af_new method, which initializes a new instance of Permutation, seems to be a likely candidate for modifications.

The expected behavior is to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation, but currently, it raises a `ValueError`. The analysis of the code and search results reveals that the `Permutation.__new__` method is crucial for determining how the constructor initializes a Permutation object. The method checks for various input cases and forms (like cycles, array forms) but does not explicitly handle non-disjoint cycles. The `Permutation._af_new` method is responsible for creating the Permutation object from an array form, which is a key internal representation. To resolve the issue, the code should be modified to process non-disjoint cycles by merging them appropriately or applying them sequentially as per the requirement. The relevant spans identified are 'Permutation.__new__' and 'Permutation._af_new' as they form the backbone of the constructor logic and creation of Permutation objects. These spans need to be adjusted or extended to properly handle non-disjoint cycles. Additionally, the 'Cycle.__init__' span is noted for its handling of cycles, but it does not directly relate to the issue at hand except to note that Cycle initialization does not merge or process cycles that overlap. Finally, 'Permutation.cyclic_form' is relevant as the cyclic_form property represents the permutation in a form that closely aligns with how cycles are typically defined and could be necessary for implementing behavior changes related to handling non-disjoint cycles.",
