Specifically, it should apply these cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation, rather than raising a `ValueError`. The current implementation in the 'Permutation.__new__' span checks for disjoint cycles and raises an error if they are not. This needs to be adjusted to handle non-disjoint cycles as described. Additionally, the user's request suggests that the concept of 'applying cycles in left-to-right order' might already be part of the algorithm, potentially in the 'e' part of the code. This is potentially relevant because if we can determine how cycles are currently applied, we might only need to adjust the handling of non-disjoint inputs rather than reimplement the entire cycle application logic. The 'Permutation' and 'Permutation.__new__' spans contain the logic for constructing permutations from input and should be adjusted to meet the requirements stated in the issue.",
