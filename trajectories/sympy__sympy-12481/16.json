The expected behavior is that non-disjoint cycles should be applied in left-to-right order, resulting in the identity permutation. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements, which is the case with non-disjoint cycles. The relevant code spans are identified as follows: 1. The entire `Permutation` class definition is relevant to understand the context of the issue. 2. The `__new__` method within the `Permutation` class is crucial as it handles the instantiation of the `Permutation` object and raises the `ValueError` if there are repeated elements. 3. The part of the code that checks for repeated elements and raises the error directly pertains to the issue at hand. Therefore, these sections of the code need careful modification to allow for non-disjoint cycles and to compute the resulting permutation correctly.",

Instead, it should handle such cycles by applying them in left-to-right order to construct the identity permutation. To address this, I should focus on the `Permutation.__new__` method in the `permutations.py` file. Relevant spans include the part that processes the input arguments and checks for disjoint cycles or raises exceptions for repeated elements. We must ensure that the code does not throw an exception for non-disjoint cycles but processes them correctly. The relevant code spans are where the arguments are processed to form cycles and where the errors are raised for disjoint cycles and repeated elements.",

The current behavior raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are encountered, but the desired behavior is to apply these cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. After reviewing the provided context and search results, it's evident that the `Permutation.__new__` method contains the logic for creating permutations from different types of inputs, including cycles. However, the current implementation raises a `ValueError` if the cycles are non-disjoint. To resolve the issue, we need to modify this method to process non-disjoint cycles without raising an error and apply them in the specified order. The method already processes cycle inputs, and we can extend this logic to handle non-disjoint cases.",
