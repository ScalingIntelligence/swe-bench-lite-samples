Specifically, it mentions that calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError`. The desired behavior is for the constructor to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. The current search results contain several relevant code spans from `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`. The `Permutation` class definition and its methods, including `__new__`, `_af_new`, and others, provide context for understanding how permutations are constructed and managed. However, the specific section related to handling non-disjoint cycles is not explicitly addressed in the provided spans. To resolve this issue, it would be necessary to modify the `__new__` method or introduce a new helper method to manage the application of non-disjoint cycles according to the left-to-right rule, ensuring that a `ValueError` is not raised for such cases. Additionally, further investigation into the cyclic form and its handling in the class methods would be beneficial to ensure consistency.",

The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the cycles. The issue suggests that non-disjoint cycles should be allowed and processed in left-to-right order, forming the resulting permutation. The identified code spans include the `Permutation.__new__` method, which is where the error is being raised, and the `__new__` method of the `PermutationGroup` class, which might also need to handle non-disjoint cycles. Given the complexity of the `Permutation` class handling cycles, we should focus on the `Permutation.__new__` method initially. Handling non-disjoint cycles likely involves modifying the cycle processing logic to avoid theValueError and instead resolve the cycles correctly. No other sections or files appear directly relevant to addressing the specific issue of non-disjoint cycles at this initial stage, although understanding the broader context (like in `PermutationGroup`) could be relevant as the solution develops.",
