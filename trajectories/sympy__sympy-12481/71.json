The relevant code spans to address this issue are those that involve the construction of the `Permutation` class and specifically the handling of input cycles. The `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class is the most relevant part of the code as it is responsible for initializing the permutation from the given arguments. Within this method, the handling of cycles is crucial. The code currently raises an error if there are repeated elements in the input cycles, which aligns with the issue description. To resolve the issue, this part of the code should be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order instead of raising an error.
