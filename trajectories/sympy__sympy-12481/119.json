Specifically, calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` should construct the identity permutation, but it currently raises a `ValueError`. The goal is to modify the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately, applying them in left-to-right order. Given the context provided, the relevant file for this change appears to be 'sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py', which contains the definition of the `Permutation` class and its constructor.",

Specifically, the code span id='Permutation.__new__' contains the logic that needs to be checked and potentially modified to handle non-disjoint cycles properly. The current logic filters out non-disjoint cycles effectively by setting 'ok' to False, which is a candidate for modification to accommodate the requirements in the reported issue.
