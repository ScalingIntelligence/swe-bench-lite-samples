The current behavior raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are passed to the constructor, but the desired behavior is to apply these cycles left-to-right and return the resulting permutation. To resolve this, we need to identify where the validation of cycles occurs in the code and how to modify it to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately. Given the context provided, the relevant file is likely `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, where the `Permutation` class is defined.",
