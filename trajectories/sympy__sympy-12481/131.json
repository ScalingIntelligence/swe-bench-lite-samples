The expected behavior is for the constructor to process these cycles in a left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation, rather than raising a `ValueError`. Given the detailed file context provided, the relevant file appears to be `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, specifically the `Permutation` class and its `__new__` method, where the constructor logic resides. Given the specificity of the issue, a detailed look into the `__new__` method and possibly related utility functions or methods handling cycle processing is necessary.",

The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided, but the user expects the cycles to be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation to be returned. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the construction and processing of cycles within the `Permutation` class. Analyzing the provided search results, the key spans to focus on are those related to the `Permutation.__new__` method, which is responsible for initializing a `Permutation` object. This method currently does not handle non-disjoint cycles correctly, and it is the primary area where the fix needs to be implemented. Additionally, the `Permutation._af_new` method, which creates a new `Permutation` instance from an array form, can be involved in applying the cycles sequentially. Exploring these spans should provide a clear path toward implementing the desired functionality for handling non-disjoint cycles.",

The code should be modified to remove the check for repeated elements when handling cycles and to compute the resulting permutation array from the resolved cycles. These changes primarily involve the cycle handling part of the method.",
