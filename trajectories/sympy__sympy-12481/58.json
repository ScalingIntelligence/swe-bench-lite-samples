This method handles various input types, including `Cycle` objects, to form array representations for the permutation. However, when constructed with non-disjoint cycles, it currently raises a `ValueError`, which aligns with the issue's description. To address this, it is crucial to modify this method or associated helper methods like `_af_rmuln` (not included in the context) that might be responsible for the composition of permutations from cycles. Additionally, exploring the `Cycle` class itself for handling overlapping elements could also yield solutions by either adjusting the initialization logic or creating a new method within the `Permutation` class for handling non-disjoint cycles properly.",

The user is requesting a change where non-disjoint cycles are handled in a left-to-right manner, leading to the creation of a valid permutation. This suggests modifying the `Permutation.__new__` method to handle non-disjoint cycles, possibly by using the `Cycle` class to resolve non-disjoint cycles into a valid array form. The search results confirm the presence of the `Permutation.__new__` method and related helper functions like `_af_new`, `_af_rmul`, `_af_pow`, and others, which can be utilized to implement the desired behavior. Therefore, the focus should be on identifying the necessary code spans involved in creating and handling permutations, specifically targeting the area where non-disjoint cycles are currently causing an error.",

This method handles various input types, including `Cycle` objects, to form array representations for the permutation. However, this method currently raises a `ValueError` when encountering non-disjoint cycles, as described in the issue. This indicates that the currently implemented behavior does not align with the desired functionality outlined in the issue. To fully address this issue, modifications would likely need to be made in multiple areas: possibly adjusting the handling of cycles within the `Permutation` class's `__new__` method or identifying necessary changes in helper methods like `_af_rmuln` --- though, this specific helper method was not present in the context provided. Additionally, potential enhancements in the `Cycle` class might also be pertinent for correctly managing non-disjoint cycle inputs. Based on this analysis, although insights into where changes might be required are provided, specific code detailing how non-disjoint cycles should be managed (such as ensuring their left-to-right application and creation of resultant permutations) is not completely covered by the included file context, suggesting that more detailed code context related to handling cycle conjunctions might be necessary to fully resolve the issue.",
            "search_suggestions": "The suggested areas to search for further relevant code might include additional methods like `_af_rmuln` within the `Permutation` class that handle the multiplication or composition of arrays for permutations, or potentially the `Cycle` class itself to understand and adjust the handling of overlapping cycle elements and to ensure the correct application order for non-disjoint cycles. Reviewing how cycles are concatenated or composed into permutations within these areas may yield more detailed context crucial for addressing the issue fully."
