The current implementation in the `__new__` method raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are detected. To resolve this issue, we need to modify the behavior to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. The relevant part of the code to examine is where the check for non-disjoint cycles occurs and the corresponding error is raised. This is found in the `__new__` method where the `has_dups` function is used to detect duplicates in the flattened list of cycle elements. The solution involves removing the error and instead implementing the merging of overlapping cycles. This necessitates changes to both the detection logic and the subsequent processing to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly.",
