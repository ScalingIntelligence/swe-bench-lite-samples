The relevant code spans to address this issue are those related to the `Permutation` class constructor and handling of cycles. The constructor is defined in the span with id 'Permutation.__new__'. Additionally, the code that handles cyclic form transformation could also be relevant, specifically the span with id 'Permutation.cyclic_form'.
