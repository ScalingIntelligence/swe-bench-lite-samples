Currently, the code raises a `ValueError` for non-disjoint cycles. By analyzing the search results, it's evident that the `Permutation` class and its `__new__` method directly handle the initialization and validation of the permutation. The `__new__` method checks for disjoint cycles and raises an error if any duplicates are found. To address the issue, the logic within the `__new__` method for handling cycles needs to be modified to deal with non-disjoint cycles appropriately without raising an error. The span id 'Permutation.__new__' is identified as relevant since it contains the logic that needs alteration. The rest of the spans only set up the environment and do not address the issue directly.",
