  "initial_message": "`Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles\nCalling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.\n"
