The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are detected. To address this, the relevant code span to modify is the one where the `ValueError` is raised due to the detection of repeated elements. This is found within the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class. Specifically, the code that checks for the presence of duplicate elements (has_dups(temp)) and raises the `ValueError` needs to be adjusted to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately instead of throwing an error. The `Permutation.__new__` span is clearly relevant to the issue because it is responsible for the creation and validation of permutations from cycles, including the error-raising step that is at the core of the reported issue. Therefore, this span needs to be modified to integrate the functionality of applying non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order, which would resolve the current issue without preventing the creation of the identity permutation in the case of non-disjoint cycles like `[[0,1],[0,1]]`. Moreover, the `Permutation` class and its `__new__` method span encapsulates all the logic needed to handle permutations, including cycle transformations, validation against non-disjoint inputs, and constructing the permutation objects.",

If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\r\n\r\nThis should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.\n"
