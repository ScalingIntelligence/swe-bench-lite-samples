The expected behavior is to apply the cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. The provided context suggests that the relevant code is likely in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file, specifically within the `Permutation` class. However, the trace of the ` ValueError` suggests that additional validation or handling for non-disjoint cycles might be missing. The goal is to identify where this validation occurs or should occur and modify it to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately.",
