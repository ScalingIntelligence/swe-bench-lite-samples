The current implementation checks for disjoint cycles and raises an error if they are not. The task is to modify this behavior to apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order. The identified code spans in the `Permutation.__new__` method indicate where the error is raised and how to potentially implement the desired functionality, including checking the input, handling cycles, and processing them accordingly.
