The relevant part of the code to address this issue is the `Permutation.__new__` method, where the check for non-disjoint cycles and the corresponding `ValueError` are found. To resolve the issue, this part of the code needs to be modified to apply the cycles in left-to-right order and construct the resulting permutation without raising the `ValueError` for non-disjoint cycles. The identified relevant code spans are those within the `Permutation.__new__` method that deal with cycle handling and error checking.
