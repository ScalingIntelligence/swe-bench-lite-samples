It specifies that calling Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]]) raises a ValueError, whereas it should construct the identity permutation when cycles are non-disjoint. The problem lies in handling non-disjoint cycles during the construction of a permutation. The relevant files identified in the context are 'sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py', which contains the Permutation class, and 'sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py', which might also have code related to permutations but not explicitly handling non-disjoint cycles according to the snippet provided. Given the description, the focus should be on the Permutation class's __new__ method in 'sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py' and the cycle handling within it.",

Currently, the code raises a `ValueError` if the cycles are non-disjoint, which is not the expected behavior according to the issue. This should be fixed by applying the cycles in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle cycle checking and application. From the search results, we see the `Permutation.__new__` and `Cycle.__init__` methods are relevant as they handle the creation and initialization of cycles and permutations. The `Cycle.__init__` method currently checks for duplicate elements and raises a `ValueError` if found. This logic needs to be changed to apply the cycles in left-to-right order if they are non-disjoint. Additionally, the `Permutation.__new__` method should be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately, possibly by removing the duplicate cycle check or modifying it to apply the cycles in the correct order.",
