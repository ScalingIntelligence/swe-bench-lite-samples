This suggests that the code responsible for handling cycles and checking for disjointness in the `Permutation` class is likely to be relevant. By examining the code, the `Permutation.__new__` span appears to be the constructor method for the Permutation class, which is where the check for disjoint cycles and the construction logic would be implemented. This span contains logic for handling different types of input, including cycles, and checks for repeated elements, which is related to the disjointness issue mentioned in the reported problem. Therefore, it is the most relevant span for addressing the issue. The other spans, such as imports and class definition, while necessary for context, are not directly related to the issue at hand.",

Specifically, it expects that passing non-disjoint cycles to the constructor should result in the creation of a permutation based on the left-to-right application of those cycles, rather than raising an error. Upon reviewing the provided code in the `sympy.combinatorics.permutations` module, it is evident that the current implementation raises a `ValueError` if duplicate elements are detected in the input to the constructor. This directly contradicts the desired behavior described in the issue. To resolve this, the relevant parts of the code that currently handle the detection of duplicate elements and raise the `ValueError` need to be adjusted.

The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided, but the user expects the permutation to be constructed by applying the cycles in left-to-right order. To address this issue, we need to identify the relevant sections of the code that handle the creation and validation of cycles in the `Permutation` class. \n\nFirst, we examined the `Permutation.__new__` method, which is responsible for the creation of a `Permutation` instance. Within this method, we found the code span that checks for non-disjoint cycles and raises an error. This is the section of code that needs to be modified to resolve the issue. By examining the entire section of code in `Permutation.__new__`, we can see that the relevant parts handle the input validation and transformation of the input into the internal array form.\n\nNext, we looked at the `Permutation._af_new` method, which is responsible for creating a new permutation object from the array form. This method is used within `Permutation.__new__`, so it is also relevant to understanding the construction process.\n\nBased on the analysis, we concluded that the most relevant sections of the code are those dealing with the creation and validation of permutations, specifically the `Permutation.__new__` and `Permutation._af_new` methods.",

However, the file context does not explicitly show the addition or modification of functionality to handle non-disjoint cycles in a specific manner, as suggested in the issue. To address the issue, one would need to modify or extend the '__new__' method to process non-disjoint cycles without raising an error and to apply them in left-to-right order.
