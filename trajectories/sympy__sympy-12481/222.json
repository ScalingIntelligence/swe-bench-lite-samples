This is due to the current implementation's validation check that rejects non-disjoint cycles, raising a `ValueError`. The requirement is to modify this behavior to accept non-disjoint cycles and apply them in left-to-right order to construct the permutation. Here's what I identified as relevant from the provided code: The `Permutation.__new__` method performs the initial validation and construction of the permutation. By examining the current validation logic, I noticed that it incorrectly identifies non-disjoint cycles and raises an error. Notably, the error is raised in the block after the comment 'if not ok', which gates all further processing on the 'ok' flag. Pertinent elements to modify include the validation logic and possibly the way cycles are processed. Relevant spans include the entire `__new__` method to make the necessary modifications and the `_af_new` method to ensure the correct construction of the permutation object.",
