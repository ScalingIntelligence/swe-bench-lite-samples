The current implementation raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are passed, which needs to be modified to handle such cases by applying the cycles in left-to-right order. The relevant code spans to address this issue are primarily within the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class, which is responsible for constructing the permutation from the input arguments. Additionally, the `_af_new` method is relevant for creating a new `Permutation` object from the array form. The `is_cycle` check and the handling of arguments need to be adjusted to manage non-disjoint cycles appropriately instead of raising an error. The existing code spans identified provide the necessary context and methods to implement the required changes.",
