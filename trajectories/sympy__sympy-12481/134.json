Currently, the code raises a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements in the input, indicating that it does not support non-disjoint cycles. The relevant code spans are those dealing with the validation and processing of input cycles within the `Permutation.__new__` method. Specifically, the code checks for duplicates and raises an error if any are found, which directly aligns with the issue being reported.

Specifically, the issue indicates that calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The expected behavior is that if the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.\n\nThe relevant code spans to address this issue are located within the `Permutation` class and the `Cycle` class. The `Permutation.__new__` method is responsible for constructing the permutation object and handling the input arguments. The `Cycle.__call__` method is used to apply cycles, and the `Cycle.list` method is used to convert cycles to a list representation which is then used by the `Permutation` constructor.\n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans include:\n1. `Permutation.__new__`: Handles the construction of the `Permutation` object and parsing of input arguments.\n2. `Cycle.__call__`: Used to apply cycles which are then handled by the `Permutation.__new__` method.\n3. `Cycle.list`: Converts cycles to a list representation which is essential for the `Permutation` constructor to process them.\n\nThese code spans will help in understanding and modifying the current behavior to meet the requirements specified in the reported issue.",

The `Cycle` class extends `dict`, and its methods show how cycles can be combined and transformed into lists. However, the context does not explicitly show how non-disjoint cycles are currently handled or how they might be adjusted to support left-to-right application. The `Permutation` constructor's implementation indicates that it constructs a permutation from the input cycles, but it does not handle non-disjoint cycles explicitly. To implement the desired behavior, modifications to the `Permutation` constructor and possibly the `Cycle` class methods might be necessary. More specifically, the code needs to identify and merge overlapping cycles when constructing a permutation, ensuring that the cycles are applied in left-to-right order. Given the complexity of cycle handling in permutations, direct adjustments to the constructor and pairing with cycle manipulation methods like those in the `Cycle` class may be necessary to effectively manage non-disjoint cycles.",
