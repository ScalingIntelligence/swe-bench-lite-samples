            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of the `Permutation` constructor when dealing with non-disjoint cycles. The current implementation raises a `ValueError` if non-disjoint cycles are detected. However, the user expects that instead of raising an error, the constructor should apply these cycles in left-to-right order to form a permutation. \n\nThe solution involves modifying the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately. This requires understanding how cycles are currently processed and how they can be resolved into a single permutation. Initially, the code checks for duplicates in the cycles and raises an error if any are found. The task here is to remove the condition that errors on duplicates and instead apply the cycles such that their overlapping elements are correctly ordered.\n\nSteps to resolve this issue:\n1. Identify the block of code in `Permutation.__new__` that checks for duplicates in the cycles.\n2. Modify this block of code to allow non-disjoint cycles.\n3. Implement logic to apply the cycles in left-to-right order.\n4. Ensure that the resulting permutation is returned correctly.\n\nSeveral key spans in the provided code relate to this problem. These include the main `Permutation` class definition (span id 'Permutation'), the `__new__` method where the main logic exists (span id 'Permutation.__new__'), and possibly other helper functions or methods that might contribute to resolving cycles into permutations.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant spans that need to be reviewed and potentially modified are the `Permutation` class block and the `__new__` method block, which handle the creation of permutations. These are key to addressing the issue at hand, as the logic to detect and handle non-disjoint cycles exists primarily within this section of the code.",
