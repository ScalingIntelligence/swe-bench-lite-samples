The expected behavior is for the constructor to handle such cycles by applying them in left-to-right order, rather than raising an error. This functionality does not currently exist in the provided `Permutation.__new__` method. Specifically, the method raises a `ValueError` when detecting non-disjoint cycles. The relevant part of the code that needs modification is the section where duplicates are detected and an error is raised. To address the issue, we need to implement the logic for combining non-disjoint cycles in the correct order, which is not present in the current implementation. This task requires identifying the relevant span in the code where the error is raised and determining how best to modify or supplement it to achieve the desired functionality.",
