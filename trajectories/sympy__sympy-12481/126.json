The relevant code is likely in the `permutations.py` file within the `sympy/combinatorics/` directory, focusing on the `Permutation` class and its methods. Additionally, there might be related methods or checks in utility functions within the same directory.",

Specifically, the issue is that calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The desired behavior is to allow non-disjoint cycles and apply them in left-to-right order to compute the resulting permutation.\n\nOn examining the search results, the relevant files identified are `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` and `sympy/combinatorics/perm_groups.py`. The key code span to focus on is `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` where the `Permutation` class and its methods are defined.\n\nFrom the `Permutation` class, the relevant spans seem to be the `Permutation.__new__` method and possibly the `Permutation._af_new` method. The `Permutation.__new__` method handles the creation of the permutation instance, and the `Permutation._af_new` method is involved in creating a new permutation from an array form. This suggests that the logic for handling the input and processing the cycles might be within these methods.\n\nTo address the issue, one would need to modify the code in these areas to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately. The provided code spans do not directly show the handling of non-disjoint cycles, which suggests that this error might be due to missing logic rather than explicit error-raising code.\n\nThe search task is not complete as the relevant code span related to handling of non-disjoint cycles is not yet identified. Further investigation into the methods of the `Permutation` class, particularly `Permutation.__new__` and `Permutation._af_new`, is required.",
