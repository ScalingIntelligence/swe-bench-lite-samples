Specifically, when non-disjoint cycles are passed to the constructor, it raises a `ValueError` instead of computing the permutation as expected. The goal is to modify the constructor to process non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order, which should be straightforward. The relevant file to modify is likely `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, specifically the `Permutation` class and its associated methods.",

Specifically, calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The user expects that if cycles are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned. This suggests modifications to the `Permutation` constructor and potentially the `_af_new` method to handle the construction of permutations from non-disjoint cycles. Considering the current context, no relevant code has been identified yet, so I will focus on the `Permutation` class and its constructor.\n\nI examined the search results which provided a detailed view of the `Permutation` class in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file. Key spans include the imports, the class definition, and several methods within the class related to permutation operations. Importantly, the `__new__` method is where the construction logic of a `Permutation` object starts, making it a critical focus for potential modifications. The `_af_new` method is a static method responsible for creating a new `Permutation` instance from an array form, which may also be relevant for handling non-disjoint cycles, though it does not directly address non-disjoint input cycles yet.\n\nOverall, while there's a wealth of utility within the `Permutation` class, the most directly applicable code spans are those involved in the creation and initialization of `Permutation` objects, particularly the constructor (`__new__` method) and the `_af_new` method.",

Specifically, `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation. The requirement is to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation. The relevant part of the codebase to address this issue is the `Permutation.__new__` method, which is responsible for the initialization of the Permutation object. This method should be modified to handle non-disjoint cycles appropriately. Additionally, the `Cycle` class should be inspected for any related functionality that might need adjustment, especially the `__init__` method, which initializes a Cycle object. The provided search results include the `Permutation.__new__` and `Cycle.__init__` methods, which are directly relevant to resolving the issue at hand. The analysis of these methods and their related sections reveals that the current implementation explicitly checks for disjoint cycles and raises a `ValueError` on finding non-disjoint cycles. This behavior needs to be amended to allow non-disjoint cycles and apply them as specified.",
