While other classes like `BaseEnsemble`, `BatchedCalls`, `ParameterGrid`, and `MockDataFrame` also define `__len__` methods, these do not directly relate to the `Pipeline` class mentioned in the issue. The relevant section of the code I've identified is within `sklearn/pipeline.py`, where the `Pipeline` class is defined without the `__len__` method currently. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the `__len__` method in this class to address the reported issue.
