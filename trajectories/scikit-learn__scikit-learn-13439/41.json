The current `Pipeline` class in the search results does not explicitly define the `__len__` method, which is essential for resolving the reported issue. The analysis of the provided code spans reveals that the `Pipeline` class has several methods and properties relevant to its functionality, such as `__init__`, `get_params`, `set_params`, `_validate_steps`, `_iter`, `__getitem__`, `named_steps`, and others. However, there is no direct implementation of the `__len__` method. The task is to identify the appropriate code spans in the `Pipeline` class to determine where the `__len__` method should be added. Once identified, the implementation of the `__len__` method can be introduced to support the required functionality.\n\nBased on the analysis, the `Pipeline` class should include the `__len__` method, which returns the length of the pipeline's steps. The relevant code span for this task is the `Pipeline` class definition itself, as the `__len__` method will be a new method added to the class.
