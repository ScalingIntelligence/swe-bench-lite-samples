The steps to reproduce the issue indicate that the Pipeline class should implement `__len__`. Given the relevance of `__len__` methods in other files like `ParameterGrid` and `BaseEnsemble`, it seems reasonable to focus the search on functions or classes named `Pipeline` in `sklearn/pipeline.py`, as well as considering any class that might inherit or compose this functionality.",

Currently, there is no explicit implementation of `__len__` in the provided `Pipeline` class code. The closest potentially relevant method is `_iter`, which uses `len(self.steps)` internally. However, this is not directly exposed for indexing operations. To address the issue, the `Pipeline` class should explicitly define the `__len__` method. The relevant spans to consider for implementing `__len__` are those related to the `Pipeline` class, especially `Pipeline.__init__` and `Pipeline._validate_steps`, as they set up and validate the steps of the pipeline. The search results do not currently include an implementation of `__len__`, indicating that the search task is not yet complete; a relevant code span for `__len__` needs to be added.",
