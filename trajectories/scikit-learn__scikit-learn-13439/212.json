Looking at the provided file context, the `Pipeline` class is primarily located in `sklearn/pipeline.py`. Based on the information provided, the `__len__` method may not be directly present in this file, but it is implemented in other classes like `BaseEnsemble`. Therefore, I will focus on searching both `sklearn/pipeline.py` for any related code implementing `__len__` and also for potential patterns in the class definition or nearby methods. Additionally, I will look at `sklearn/ensemble/base.py` since `__len__` is explicitly implemented there in `BaseEnsemble`, which might offer a similar pattern or guidance. This search approach ensures we're covering the relevant areas that may relate to the `Pipeline` class and its required functionality.",

Looking at the provided file context, the `Pipeline` class is primarily located in `sklearn/pipeline.py`. Based on the information provided, the `__len__` method may not be directly present in this file, but it is implemented in other classes like `BaseEnsemble`. Therefore, I will focus on searching both `sklearn/pipeline.py` for any related code implementing `__len__` and also for potential patterns in the class definition or nearby methods. Additionally, I will look at `sklearn/ensemble/base.py` since `__len__` is explicitly implemented there in `BaseEnsemble`, which might offer a similar pattern or guidance.
