The search results show several files and classes that either implement `__len__` or are related to the `Pipeline` class. The primary focus should be on the `sklearn/pipeline.py` file where the `Pipeline` class is defined. We need to identify if the `Pipeline` class indeed lacks the `__len__` method and if so, where it should be implemented. In the `sklearn/pipeline.py` file, the `Pipeline` class spans are found, but there is no `__len__` method implementation. Also, there are examples in other files (`sklearn/ensemble/base.py`, `sklearn/externals/joblib/_dask.py`, `sklearn/externals/joblib/parallel.py`, `sklearn/utils/mocking.py`, `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`) where classes already implement the `__len__` method, which can serve as a reference for how to implement the method in the `Pipeline` class. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those related to the `Pipeline` class in `sklearn/pipeline.py`, and the actual implementation of `__len__` would likely need to be added within the `Pipeline` class spans.",

The search results include several files, but the most relevant ones are: `sklearn/pipeline.py`, which defines the `Pipeline` class; `sklearn/ensemble/base.py`, which has a `__len__` method in the `BaseEnsemble` class; and `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`, which has a `__len__` method in the `ParameterGrid` class. These examples can be used to guide the implementation of the `__len__` method in the `Pipeline` class. Additionally, `sklearn/utils/mocking.py` and `sklearn/externals/joblib/parallel.py` also contain `__len__` methods in their respective classes (`MockDataFrame` and `BatchedCalls`), which could be referenced for implementation details.
