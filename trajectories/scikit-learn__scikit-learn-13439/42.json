These serve as good examples of how to implement the method. Given the context, it's likely that the `Pipeline` class does not currently have `__len__` implemented and this needs to be added. The approach could be similar to that seen in the `BaseEnsemble` class, where `__len__` returns the length of an internal attribute (`self.estimators_`), which represents the number of steps or components in the ensemble or pipeline. For the `Pipeline` class, this could involve returning the length of `self.steps`, which is a list containing the steps of the pipeline.
