The search results provided a relevant code span in the BaseEnsemble class from sklearn/ensemble/base.py. This class has an implemented __len__ method, which directly addresses the need described in the issue. Reviewing the code, it appears that the __len__ method in the BaseEnsemble class is exactly what is required for the Pipeline class to return its length. Therefore, this code span is highly relevant as it provides a clear example of how to implement the __len__ method in a class similar to the Pipeline class in sklearn. This implementation uses the length of the 'estimators_' attribute in the BaseEnsemble class, suggesting a similar approach might be taken for the Pipeline class.",
