Upon examining the search results, it's clear that the Pipeline class does not currently define a __len__ method. This missing method is crucial for the described functionality to work without raising errors. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue would include those sections of the Pipeline class definition that deal with the initialization, validation, and iteration over steps, as these are foundational to understanding and implementing the __len__ method. Specifically, the spans dealing with `__init__`, `_validate_steps`, and `_iter` are relevant as they touch upon the steps attribute which would be essential for the __len__ method. Additionally, any other method implementing similar functionality or interacting closely with these methods should also be considered. However, no specific span directly addresses the missing __len__ method, indicating that it needs to be implemented.",
