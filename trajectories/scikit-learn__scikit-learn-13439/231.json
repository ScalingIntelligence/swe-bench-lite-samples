This method should return the number of steps in the pipeline. Given the context, the pipeline class is defined in sklearn/pipeline.py, and examples of similar implementations can be found in classes like BaseEnsemble which includes a __len__ method. Therefore, a targeted search in sklearn/pipeline.py for the Pipeline class to identify where the __len__ method could be implemented is appropriate.",

Analyzing the provided search results, the Pipeline class definition is present in the code spans.
