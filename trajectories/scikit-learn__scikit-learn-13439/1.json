From the provided code and the issue description, it's clear that the `__len__` method is missing from the `Pipeline` class in the `sklearn/pipeline.py` file. Implementing this method will allow the pipeline to return the number of steps it contains, which is necessary for the indexing operation mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the `__len__` method is present in other classes like `BaseEnsemble`, which suggests that implementing this method in `Pipeline` will ensure consistency across similar classes.",
