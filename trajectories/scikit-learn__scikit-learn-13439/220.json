The search results include several code spans from the `Pipeline` class in the `sklearn/pipeline.py` file, but none of them directly implement the `__len__` method. This suggests that the implementation of `__len__` might be missing in the provided codebase. Since the issue specifically asks for the implementation of `__len__`, and it's not present in the search results, it's clear that the relevant code span for `__len__` is missing in the provided results.
