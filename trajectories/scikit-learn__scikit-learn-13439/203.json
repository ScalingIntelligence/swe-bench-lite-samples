The current search results include several files with potential relevant code spans. The `Pipeline` class definition is found in `sklearn/pipeline.py`, but it does not currently implement the `__len__` method. Implementing this method would require adding a `__len__` method to the `Pipeline` class. Comparing the related classes, `BaseEnsemble` in `sklearn/ensemble/base.py` implements a `__len__` method, which could serve as a reference for how to implement it in `Pipeline`. Additionally, there are other `__len__` method implementations in `BatchedCalls` and `ParameterGrid`, but these are less directly relevant as they are not part of the `Pipeline` class. However, they could still serve as further examples of how the `__len__` method might be implemented. The search results do not provide an existing `__len__` implementation for `Pipeline`, suggesting that the task is not yet complete and requires implementing this method in the `Pipeline` class.",
