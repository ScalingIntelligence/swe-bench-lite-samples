Additionally, the `BaseEnsemble` class in `sklearn/ensemble/base.py` provides a reference since it already implements the `__len__` method, suggesting a potential model for how `Pipeline` might implement this functionality. The `BatchedCalls`, `ParameterGrid`, and `MockDataFrame` classes also each implement `__len__`, but the focus remains primarily on the `Pipeline` class as per the user's request. These other instances hint at general patterns for implementing `__len__`, possibly beneficial for adapting or replicating in the `Pipeline` class. Overall, understanding the patterns and structures used in the relevant classes that already implement `__len__` can guide the implementation in the `Pipeline` class where it is missing.
