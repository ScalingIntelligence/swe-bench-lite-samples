We should focus our search on this file to find where the `__len__` method can be implemented. Additionally, we can look at other classes in `sklearn/ensemble/base.py` and `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py` to understand how the `__len__` method is implemented in similar contexts for reference. We should ensure that at least one of query, code_snippet, class_name, or function_name is provided for the search function.
