Each of these classes has a __len__ method that returns the length of their respective attributes, which is relevant to the issue at hand. Among these, BaseEnsemble and MockDataFrame are particularly relevant as they are part of the ensemble module and utilities, which could be related to the pipeline functionality being discussed.

The analysis of other files and classes reveals implementations of `__len__` in various context, like `BatchedCalls` and `BaseEnsemble`, but none directly related to the `Pipeline` functionality needed to resolve the issue. Therefore, the relevant code spans to identify are those defining or concerning the `Pipeline` class and the specific method that may lead to the resolution of implementing `__len__` for this class. Additionally, while other classes implement `__len__`, such as `MockDataFrame` or `BaseEnsemble`, these are not directly related to the `Pipeline` functionality affected by the issue.
