The issue mentions implementing `__len__` in the Pipeline class, so I will focus on code spans that define this method in the context of scikit-learn's classes or modules related to pipelining and ensemble methods. Looking through the search results, I found several instances of `__len__` implementations in different classes. The first relevant implementation is in `BaseEnsemble` which supports my hypothesis since it is related to ensemble methods and could be similar to how Pipeline should implement it. I will mark this as relevant. Additionally, the implementation in other classes like `_WeakKeyDictionary` and `BatchedCalls` may be informative but are not directly related to the Pipeline class itself. I will not include these. The `MockDataFrame` and `ParameterGrid`, while having relevant implementations, do not directly pertain to the Pipeline class. Finally, I will include the `BaseEnsemble` implementation as it is the closest match contextually and related to the ensemble-like structure that a Pipeline aims to achieve.",

Currently, the `Pipeline` class in `sklearn/pipeline.py` does not have a __len__ method defined. The search results include several files with __len__ method implementations, but the focus should be on the `Pipeline` class where the function needs to be added. Relevant code spans are those defining the `Pipeline` class and possibly similar implementations elsewhere. To address the issue, it would be necessary to add a __len__ method similar to those in `BaseEnsemble`, `_WeakKeyDictionary`, `BatchedCalls`, `MockDataFrame`, and `ParameterGrid`. However, it is important to add this method only in the Pipeline class, as that is where the functionality is missing. Extracting the __len__ method from these examples would guide in implementing the needed functionality in the Pipeline class.",
