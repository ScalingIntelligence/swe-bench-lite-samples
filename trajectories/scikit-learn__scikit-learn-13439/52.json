This method should return the number of steps in the pipeline. By examining the provided search results, there is no explicit implementation of the `__len__` method in the Pipeline class. To resolve the issue, it's necessary to add this method to the Pipeline class. The identified spans include the constructor (`__init__`), and various methods like `__getitem__`, `fit`, `transform`, among others, which provide context but do not directly address the lack of a `__len__` method. Since the `__len__` method is not implemented, I recommend adding it to the Pipeline class to return the length of the steps.
