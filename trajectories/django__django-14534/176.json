The current implementation of BoundWidget.id_for_label ignores the 'id' set by ChoiceWidget.options, leading to unexpected behavior when overriding auto_id in form initialization. To address this, the BoundWidget.id_for_label method should be modified to use the 'id' from self.data['attrs']['id'] instead of generating a new 'id'.
