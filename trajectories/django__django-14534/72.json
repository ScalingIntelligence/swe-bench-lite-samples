The issue specifically mentions that `BoundWidget.id_for_label` ignores the 'id' provided in `self.data['attrs']['id']`. The provided search results help in identifying the relevant code spans. First, from `django/forms/widgets.py`, the `ChoiceWidget.create_option` method sets the 'id' attribute for the options. Next, from `django/forms/boundfield.py`, it's crucial to analyze the `BoundWidget.id_for_label` method which is currently returning a hardcoded id pattern instead of using the 'id' attribute from `self.data['attrs']`. Lastly, the `BoundField.id_for_label` method from the same file also provides context on how the id for labels is determined, which is indirectly affected by the issue in `BoundWidget`.

This re-implementation for rendering the \"id\" is confusing and presumably not intended. Nobody has probably realized that so far, because rarely the auto_id-argument is overridden when initializing a form. If however we do, one would assume that the method BoundWidget.id_for_label renders that string as specified through the auto_id format-string.\nBy changing the code from above to\nclass BoundWidget:\n\t...\n\tdef id_for_label(self):\n\t\treturn self.data['attrs']['id']\nthat function behaves as expected.\nPlease note that this error only occurs when rendering the subwidgets of a widget of type CheckboxSelectMultiple.
