The issue suggests that passing 'empty_permitted' in form_kwargs should be ignored for empty_form since it is irrelevant for it. This implies that the code handling how form_kwargs are passed or used in the creation of empty_form needs to be examined. The relevant code spans identified are from 'django/forms/formsets.py', specifically the 'BaseFormSet' class's '__init__' method, which initializes form_kwargs and sets up the formset, and the 'empty_form' property, which constructs the empty form. The 'django/forms/models.py' file's 'BaseModelFormSet' class is also relevant as it extends 'BaseFormSet' and defines '_construct_form', which is crucial for constructing individual forms within a formset, potentially handling form_kwargs. Additionally, the 'django/contrib/admin/options.py' file's 'ModelAdmin' class is potentially relevant as it deals with high-level formset management in the Django admin interface, but the spans provided do not directly pertain to the form_kwargs issue. The key focus should be on understanding how form_kwargs, especially 'empty_permitted', are handled in the 'BaseFormSet' and 'BaseModelFormSet' classes to address the KeyError in empty_form rendering.",

This issue is expected to be ignored for empty_form since empty_permitted is irrelevant for empty_form. The relevant code spans are in the 'empty_form' property of the BaseFormSet class. The search results confirm the existence of the 'empty_form' property and its use of the 'empty_permitted' parameter. Additionally, the 'form_kwargs' are used in the '__init__' method of BaseFormSet, which is related to the form_kwargs passed to the formset. Therefore, the identified code spans from the search results, particularly from `BaseFormSet.__init__` and `BaseFormSet.empty_form`, are indeed relevant to the reported issue.
