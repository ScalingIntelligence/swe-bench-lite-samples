This suggests a direct interaction with the BaseFormSet class and its handling of form_kwargs. The relevant code spans identified in the search results involve the BaseFormSet initialization (__init__) and the construction of forms (_construct_form). These methods are crucial for understanding how form_kwargs are processed and how forms are constructed. The `formset_factory` function is also relevant for creating formsets, which could lead to a deeper understanding of the interaction of these parts with empty_form. No specific handling for 'empty_permitted' in relation to empty_form is found in the search results, suggesting there's no dedicated code segment addressing this particular problem, which aligns with the reported issue where 'empty_permitted' appears to be ignored or causing an error for empty_form. Therefore, critical segments in the BaseFormSet to investigate further for handling form_kwargs and constructing forms include __init__, _construct_form, and possibly involving ManagementForm if additional context from it helps unveil more insight.",
