The expected behavior is that 'empty_permitted' should be ignored for empty_form.\n\n2. Reviewing current file context: The context provided already has code spans related to BaseModelFormSet, including its __init__ and add_fields methods, which are likely relevant since they involve form initialization and field addition that might affect 'empty_form'.\n\n3. Processing new search results: \n   a. Relevant Information: There are multiple spans in the search results that handle formset and form initialization, including 'BaseModelFormSet.__init__', 'BaseModelFormSet.add_fields', and 'BaseFormSet.__init__'. These are critical as they manage form initialization and field addition, directly related to the form_kwargs handling which is where the issue lies.\n   b. Potential Issue Locations: It appears that the '_construct_form' method in BaseModelFormSet is particularly important as it constructs forms and deals with instances, which likely involves handling 'empty_permitted' and might be causing the KeyError. Additionally, the 'BaseFormSet.__init__' method handles the initialization of the formset and the form_kwargs.\n\n4. Deciding on Relevance of Code Spans: The spans 'BaseModelFormSet.__init__', 'BaseModelFormSet.add_fields', 'BaseFormSet.__init__', and 'BaseModelFormSet._construct_form' are identified as relevant because they directly involve the form and formset creation, manipulation of fields, and instance handling, all of which are areas likely to be causing or directly involve managing the 'empty_permitted' parameter.\n",

Specifically, the `_construct_form` method in `BaseModelFormSet` is responsible for constructing forms within a formset, including handling primary keys and instances. The method doesn't directly manipulate or pass `form_kwargs` to individual forms other than through the generic form construction process. It's also worth noting that `form_kwargs` are not explicitly mentioned or handled in the `_construct_form` method, suggesting that any specific handling of `form_kwargs` might be encapsulated in the superclass method `BaseFormSet._construct_form` or elsewhere within the formset instance initiation process. Additionally, the `add_fields` method, also in `BaseModelFormSet`, dynamically adds fields based on the model's primary key and the form's instance state, but again, it doesn't address `form_kwargs` explicitly. This indicates that the issue might reside in how `form_kwargs` are evaluated or utilized during the formset or form creation that isn't reflected in the provided methods.",

The key files to focus on are 'django/forms/formsets.py' and 'django/forms/models.py'. In 'django/forms/formsets.py', the `BaseFormSet` class and its methods related to form construction and handling are crucial as formsets manage multiple forms. Specifically, the `_construct_form` method is where forms are instantiated and additional parameters like `empty_permitted` could influence form creation. Similarly, in 'django/forms/models.py', the `BaseModelFormSet` class and its derived classes like `BaseInlineFormSet` need examination as they handle model-specific formsets which could interact differently with `empty_form`. The provided search results show relevant code spans within these classes, particularly the `_construct_form` methods in both `BaseFormSet` and `BaseModelFormSet`, which are likely places where the issue of handling `empty_permitted` could arise. Reviewing these sections ensures that the logic for handling `empty_form` and the `empty_permitted` parameter is correctly implemented and does not lead to unexpected KeyErrors or other exceptions.",

Specifically, the analysis should zero in on whether `form_kwargs` including 'empty_permitted' are being correctly processed and used during these crucial phases. Key methods to inspect are `__init__` in `BaseFormSet` and `_construct_form` in both `BaseFormSet` and its subclass `BaseModelFormSet`. Notably, the `empty_form` attribute is generated during the `_construct_form` process, and understanding how `form_kwargs` are integrated into this flow is vital.
