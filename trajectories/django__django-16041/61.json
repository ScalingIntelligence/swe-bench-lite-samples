To identify relevant code spans, I focused on the BaseModelFormSet and BaseFormSet classes in the search results, particularly the __init__ and _construct_form methods. These methods handle the initialization and construction of forms within a formset, making them potential locations for the error to occur given the issue's description.\n\nFor BaseModelFormSet, the __init__ method initializes the formset with given parameters, including form_kwargs. This could be where the 'empty_permitted' parameter is being handled initially. The _construct_form method constructs individual forms within the formset, including handling the 'empty_permitted' attribute. Errors related to missing keys or invalid parameters during form construction could manifest here.\n\nIn BaseFormSet, the __init__ method also initializes formsets and accepts form_kwargs. This method sets up the formset with the given parameters, making it another potential point of failure if 'empty_permitted' is not handled correctly. The _construct_form method in BaseFormSet is responsible for constructing each form in the formset, including adding necessary fields. This method could also contribute to the error if the 'empty_permitted' parameter affects how forms are built and validated.\n\nGiven these considerations, the identified code spans include both __init__ and _construct_form methods from both BaseModelFormSet and BaseFormSet, as they are directly involved in formset initialization and form construction, which are central to the reported issue.",

It appears that the 'BaseModelFormSet' class does not specifically handle the 'empty_permitted' argument during the construction of forms, including the 'empty_form'. The current implementation in the '_construct_form' method in 'BaseFormSet' suggests that 'empty_permitted' is set but does not consider its propagation or handling in derived classes like 'BaseModelFormSet' or 'BaseInlineFormSet'. This gap in handling could be the cause of the reported KeyError. The file context provided a relevant method '_construct_form' in 'BaseFormSet' and 'BaseModelFormSet' that could be related to the issue, indicating that the relevant areas for modification are identified.
