In 'django/forms/formsets.py', the '__init__' method initializes the formset, including handling form_kwargs, which could include 'empty_permitted'. The '_construct_form' method constructs individual forms within the formset, and it's here where the 'empty_permitted' parameter might be used or misused in the context of the empty_form.

From the provided context and search results, we can see that `form_kwargs` are passed in the `__init__` method of `BaseFormSet` and used in the `_construct_form` and `empty_form` methods. The `empty_form` property is crucial as it constructs the empty form without data. The current implementation of `empty_form` does not exclude `empty_permitted` from being applied, which might be causing the issue. We should focus on ensuring that `empty_form` does not inherit problematic `form_kwargs`, specifically `empty_permitted`, to resolve the KeyError. By identifying the relevant sections in `BaseFormSet` and `formset_factory` where `form_kwargs` are processed, we can pinpoint where adjustments need to be made to ensure `empty_form` correctly ignores `form_kwargs` when it shouldn't be impacted by them.
