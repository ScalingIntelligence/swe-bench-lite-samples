The search results reveal that 'BaseFormSet' is the class impacting the behavior, particularly in its '__init__' and 'empty_form' methods. In the '__init__' method, 'form_kwargs' are processed and stored, which sets the stage for their potential mismanagement downstream. The 'empty_form' property then constructs a form using these 'form_kwargs', potentially propagating the problem directly. Further examination confirms that 'form_kwargs' is a key input managed here, and 'empty_permitted' is not handled explicitly in a way that prevents it from causing an issue.
