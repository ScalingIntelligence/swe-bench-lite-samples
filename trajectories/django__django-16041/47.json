This suggests that the form_kwargs dictionary, specifically the 'empty_permitted' key, is not being correctly handled when processing the empty_form. To resolve this, we need to identify where and how the 'empty_permitted' attribute is being processed for formsets and their empty forms. The relevant files and classes identified in the context include BaseModelFormSet, BaseFormSet, and modelformset_factory. Additionally, since the issue affects the rendering process, the FormMixin and BaseForm classes in django/views/generic/edit.py and django/forms/forms.py may also be involved. A likely candidate for the issue is the _construct_form method in BaseFormSet or BaseModelFormSet, where the form_kwargs might be applied incorrectly. Therefore, it's essential to search within these specific methods and classes to pinpoint the exact location of the bug.",

The key elements to focus on are the initialization of forms with 'empty_permitted' and how 'empty_form' interacts with this parameter. From the search results, the most relevant code spans are in 'django/forms/forms.py'. The '__init__' method of 'BaseForm' shows how the 'empty_permitted' parameter is processed during the instantiation of a form. This method is crucial for understanding how forms are initialized with 'empty_permitted', which directly relates to the issue at hand. Also notable is the 'get_context' method, which is involved in the rendering process that crashes when 'empty_permitted' is set. Considering these elements, it's clear that the issue likely originates from the form initialization or the context data handling during rendering.

To fully assess whether the issue can be resolved based on the provided context, we would need to examine the BaseFormSet or BaseModelFormSet classes, which handle formset-specific logic, as these classes are likely to process form_kwargs including the 'empty_permitted' key. Given the current context, we can say that there is a relevant part of the code identified in the BaseForm class, but for a comprehensive understanding and possible resolution of the issue, more context from related FormSet classes would be necessary.",

The `__init__` method of `BaseFormSet` initializes the formset with `form_kwargs`, which are intended to be passed to each form during construction. However, the logic within `_construct_form` determines whether to apply `empty_permitted` based on the form's index and the `initial_form_count`, but it does not explicitly handle `form_kwargs` for `empty_form` instances separately. This could be the source of the KeyError, as `form_kwargs` might not be correctly propagated for `empty_form`. Additionally, a brief review of the `BaseForm` class within `django/forms/forms.py` shows that it includes an `empty_permitted` attribute, but this is for individual forms, not formsets. To resolve this, a deeper examination of how `form_kwargs` are processed for empty forms specifically, and possibly modifications to how these are handled within the `_construct_form` method, might be necessary.",
