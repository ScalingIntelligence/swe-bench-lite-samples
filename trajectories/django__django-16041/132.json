This issue directly points to the implementation of 'BaseFormSet' and its management of form_kwargs, especially in the context of creating an 'empty_form'. When reviewing the provided code, it is evident that 'form_kwargs' is being passed to the 'empty_form' during its creation, which includes the 'empty_permitted' argument. This passing of arguments appears to be the source of the problem because 'empty_form' specifically should not be affected by 'empty_permitted', as it is intended to be an unvalidated template for new form entries. The search results confirm the presence of 'form_kwargs' handling and show how 'BaseFormSet' constructs its 'empty_form', which aligns with the issue description. It is notable that the 'empty_form' property in 'BaseFormSet' does not handle cases where 'form_kwargs' might contain 'empty_permitted' explicitly, leading to the observed error. Thus, the identified code spans in 'forms/formsets.py' directly relate to the issue, specifically the 'BaseFormSet.empty_form' property.",
