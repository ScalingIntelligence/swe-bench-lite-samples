From the search results, the relevant code spans appear to be in the `django/forms/models.py` and `django/forms/formsets.py` files. The `BaseModelFormSet.__init__` span in `models.py` seems pertinent, as it initializes the formset and could potentially handle the `form_kwargs`. Additionally, the `BaseFormSet.__init__` span in `formsets.py` also initializes the formset but at a more general level, which could also be relevant to how `form_kwargs` are managed. These spans are identified as relevant because they relate to the initialization of formsets and the handling of kwargs, which is directly related to the issue of passing `empty_permitted` to `form_kwargs` and causing a KeyError. Since the issue is about formset initialization and handling `form_kwargs`, these sections of code are the most likely to contain the logic that needs to be inspected or adjusted to fix the issue reported.",

The current context indicates that the issue might be rooted in the initialization of the formset or the handling of `empty_form`. The search results reveal detailed implementations of `BaseFormSet`, `ManagementForm`, and the `empty_form` property. Notably, the `empty_form` property constructs a form with `empty_permitted=True`, which seems relevant to the issue. Additionally, the `get_form_kwargs` method could be a keyspot for further investigation as it handles the `form_kwargs` passed to the formset. These sections of code are critical for understanding how `empty_form` is instantiated and how `form_kwargs` are propagated.\n\nGiven the alignment between the reported issue and these sections of the code, I will mark them as relevant and proceed with the analysis.",

From the provided file context, it is clear that the 'empty_permitted' argument is not explicitly handled within the BaseFormSet or BaseModelFormSet classes. However, the BaseFormSet class has a method _construct_form which is responsible for constructing forms including form_kwargs. This method could be the place where the 'empty_permitted' argument is causing issues. Also, the property method 'empty_form' is where an empty form is created and it does explicitly set 'empty_permitted' to True, but it does not account for the form_kwargs possibly containing 'empty_permitted' leading to the KeyError. The file context provided does touch on the areas which would require investigation but lacks the specific part that directly deals with the 'empty_permitted' handling within the context of an empty_form.

The _construct_form method does not explicitly reference form_kwargs, which suggests that form_kwargs may not directly influence the behavior of individual forms created by this method. The 'empty_form' property does not use form_kwargs, only explicitly setting the 'empty_permitted' parameter to True by default. The form_kwargs handling in the __init__ method prepares the kwargs in a dictionary, but it doesn't appear they are passed further to 'empty_form', suggesting they do not affect it directly. This discrepancy hints towards a potential oversight or inconsistency in how form_kwargs are expected to be used and how they actually influence formset behaviors.",
