Specifically, it seeks to ensure that the 'empty_permitted' parameter is ignored for formset.empty_form as it is irrelevant for the empty_form. The current context and new search results indicate that the relevant code spans are primarily found in the 'django/forms/models.py' and 'django/forms/formsets.py' files. In 'django/forms/models.py', the BaseModelFormSet class and its methods, such as '__init__' and '_construct_form', are involved in the creation and handling of formsets and forms within them. In 'django/forms/formsets.py', the BaseFormSet class and its methods, including '__init__', '_construct_form', and 'empty_form', are also central to this functionality. These classes and methods handle the initialization, construction, and properties of formsets and their forms, including the handling of the 'empty_permitted' parameter for forms within the formset. The 'empty_form' property, specifically, is designed to provide an unbound form that can be cloned to add new forms to the formset. The analysis shows that these code spans are relevant to the reported issue as they are directly involved in the handling of formsets and their forms, including the 'empty_permitted' parameter. Therefore, the identified code spans should provide a good basis for addressing the reported issue concerning the handling of the 'empty_permitted' parameter in Django formsets.",

I am looking for code sections that handle the creation and rendering of formset.empty_form and the passing of form_kwargs. \n\nFrom the file context, I see that BaseModelFormSet and BaseInlineFormSet handle various aspects of formsets, but do not directly address the empty_form property or the handling of form_kwargs for empty_form. \n\nIn the new search results, I found a relevant code span in django/forms/formsets.py under BaseFormSet.empty_form. This code span directly relates to the creation of an empty form within a formset, which is the core of the reported issue. The method initializes an empty form with specific attributes and uses form_kwargs, which could be related to the KeyError mentioned in the issue. \n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code span is in the empty_form property of BaseFormSet in django/forms/formsets.py. This is the code span that directly addresses the issue of initializing and rendering the empty_form, which should not be affected by the 'empty_permitted' argument in form_kwargs.",

The analysis shows that while the 'empty_permitted' keyword is not explicitly referenced or handled in the provided methods, the setup does include parameters that could potentially influence how forms are initialized and managed, including 'initial' and various form kwargs. The absence of direct handling of 'empty_permitted' in the methods does suggest an area for potential customization or bug resolution particularly in relation to form_kwargs handling. However, since the 'empty_form' property is seen with 'empty_permitted=True' explicitly set, it implies that the framework itself might address this internally, albeit not directly visible in the provided context. Further exploration into how form kwargs are ultimately used or integrated within form creation could provide more clarity.",
