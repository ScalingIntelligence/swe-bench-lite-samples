To address this, several key areas in the Django codebase were identified that could be related to managing form and formset instances, specifically handling 'empty_permitted' and constructing empty forms. The relevant code spans were found in files such as 'django/forms/models.py' and 'django/forms/formsets.py'. These spans include how 'BaseModelForm' handles initialization with 'empty_permitted', and the 'BaseFormSet' method for constructing an empty form, where 'empty_permitted' is set to 'True'. These sections directly relate to the issue by potentially controlling how form fields are initialized without data and how formsets manage optional or empty forms. More investigation is needed to determine the exact cause of the KeyError and how to correct the behavior as expected, but these identified code parts are crucial starting points for in-depth analysis and any required fixes.",

The focus should be on methods and properties related to form construction, especially `_construct_form` and `empty_form`. From the provided code in `django/forms/formsets.py`, the `empty_form` property explicitly sets `empty_permitted=True`, which aligns with the expectation that `empty_form` should not need to be validated. However, the specific error described in the issue (KeyError with `form_kwargs = {'empty_permitted':True}`) suggests there might be deeper interaction issues within the formset handling or initialization that are not fully captured in the provided code context. More context might be needed around how form_kwargs are processed and passed down through the formset's creation and management.

This behavior is unexpected because 'empty_permitted' should not affect empty_form, as it is not meant to be used for data validation. After analyzing the provided file context and search results, it appears that the core issue is related to how 'empty_permitted' is being handled in BaseFormSet's empty_form property and in the initialization of BaseFormSet. The empty_form property explicitly sets 'empty_permitted' to True, which is correct behavior for an empty form. However, the issue arises when 'empty_permitted' is passed through form_kwargs during the initialization of the formset. There seems to be a potential issue with how the form_kwargs are merged or used in the _construct_form method, especially when setting defaults for each form in the formset. The search results confirm the existence of BaseModelFormSet and BaseInlineFormSet, which are subclasses of BaseFormSet and might be affected by the same issue if they do not properly handle 'empty_permitted' in form_kwargs. Overall, the identified code spans are relevant to understanding and potentially addressing the issue.

The expected behavior is that 'empty_permitted' should be ignored for the empty_form since it is irrelevant for empty_form validation. The relevant code spans identified from the search results and file context are centered around the BaseFormSet and BaseModelFormSet classes in django/forms/formsets.py and django/forms/models.py respectively. These classes handle the construction of formsets, including the handling of empty forms. The critical method is BaseFormSet.empty_form, which constructs the empty form with empty_permitted=True. This method should ideally ignore or handle the form_kwargs containing 'empty_permitted' to avoid the KeyError. Additionally, the BaseFormSet._construct_form method, which is responsible for creating individual forms within the formset, is also relevant as it deals with form kwargs. The search results confirm the presence of these methods in the code, making them highly relevant to the reported issue. The identified code spans are sufficient to address the issue, as they contain the necessary logic to handle or ignore the 'empty_permitted' key in form_kwargs for empty forms.",
