These methods handle the initialization of formsets and the creation of an empty form, respectively. The new search results re-present these spans, confirming our focus on correctly handling form kwargs and the creation of empty forms. The `BaseFormSet.__init__` method sets up form kwargs which could play a role in the reported KeyError if not handled properly. The `BaseFormSet.empty_form` property explicitly sets `empty_permitted` to True, implying that setting this parameter in form_kwargs might not be necessary or correctly implemented. Additionally, it's crucial to look at how form kwargs are passed down from the view to the formset and then to the form. Thus, ensuring that kwargs like 'empty_permitted' are correctly handled during form initialization and form rendering is key. This suggests that implementing a check or filtering of unnecessary/incorrect kwargs passed to empty_form could resolve the issue. This analysis leads us to the conclusion that the search task is focused on identifying and ensuring the proper handling of the 'empty_permitted' parameter within the context of formset and form initialization, especially for the empty_form.",

The expected behavior is described as having empty_permitted ignored for empty_form, given that empty_form is not intended for data submission and thus doesn't require validation.\n\nThe context provided includes several relevant file spans within the Django forms and formsets implementation. These include parts of the BaseModelFormSet class and the BaseFormSet class, particularly focusing on the initialization, form construction, and the handling of the empty_form.\n\nNew search results are analyzed to ensure continuity in relevance to the issue. The newly found code sections involve the BaseFormSet class and its methods such as _construct_form and empty_form, which are critical for understanding and addressing the issue. This code shows how forms are constructed within the formset and how the empty_form is generated, both of which could potentially be linked to the reported error on handling 'empty_permitted'.\n\nConcluding this analysis, the relevant code spans identified from both the file context and new search results are sufficient to undertake a detailed look into how 'empty_permitted' is managed with regard to the empty_form in formsets.
