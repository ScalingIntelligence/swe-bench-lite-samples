The expected behavior is that 'empty_permitted' should be ignored for formset.empty_form, as empty_form is not meant to be used to pass data and thus does not need validation. The search results provided point to several key areas in the Django forms and formset implementation that are likely relevant:\n\n1. **django/forms/models.py**: This file contains the `BaseModelForm` class, which includes an `__init__` method that handles the 'empty_permitted' parameter. This method initializes the form instance and appears to be directly involved in how 'empty_permitted' is processed.\n\n2. **django/forms/forms.py**: This file has the `BaseForm` class, which also includes an `__init__` method with 'empty_permitted' handling. It's possible that both ModelForms and regular Forms interact with 'empty_permitted' in a similar way.\n\n3. **django/forms/formsets.py**: This file contains `BaseFormSet`, including its `empty_form` property. This property is likely where the error is occurring when 'empty_permitted' is set in form_kwargs.\n\nGiven these files and specific methods relevant to form and formset handling in Django, it seems appropriate to investigate these spans in detail to see how 'empty_permitted' interacts with the creation of empty forms in formsets.",
