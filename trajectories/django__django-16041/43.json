The expected behavior is that 'empty_permitted' should be ignored for empty_form because it is not meant to be used to pass data and therefore doesn't need validation. Steps to reproduce involve setting form_kwargs to either True or False and rendering the formset.empty_form in a template, which triggers the KeyError.\n\nAnalyzing the search results, key areas of interest are the initialization of the BaseFormSet class and its handling of form_kwargs. Specifically, the BaseFormSet.__init__ span shows how form_kwargs are processed during the instantiation of a formset. This is crucial because the issue might be related to how these kwargs are being handled, especially in relation to the empty_form.\n\nAdditionally, the modelformset_factory function is relevant as it is used to create formsets with specific parameters, including form_kwargs, as demonstrated in the provided view function. Understanding how form_kwargs are propagated and used within formsets, and particularly with empty_form, is essential for addressing this issue.\n\nConsidering the provided context and search results, the identified code spans within BaseFormSet and modelformset_factory are directly relevant to the reported issue.
