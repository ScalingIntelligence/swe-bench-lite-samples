The search results provided cover several relevant parts of Django's form and formset handling classes. Here's a detailed analysis:\n\n1. **BaseModelFormSet and BaseFormSet**: These classes define the core functionality for formsets, including how forms are constructed and how fields are added. The 'empty_form' property in 'BaseFormSet' is particularly relevant as it's specifically designed to handle empty forms.\n\n2. **BaseModelFormSet._construct_form**: This method constructs forms for the formset, and it's relevant because it handles form initialization, including conditions for 'empty_permitted'.\n\n3. **BaseFormSet.empty_form**: This property is crucial as it directly relates to the 'empty_form' that the reported issue is concerned with. It initializes a form with 'empty_permitted=True'.\n\n4. **ModelAdmin**: Though not directly related to the formset issue, this class is crucial for admin views and handling model forms in the admin interface.\n\nBased on the reported issue and the provided search results, it's evident that the 'empty_form' property in 'BaseFormSet' and the '_construct_form' method in 'BaseModelFormSet' are central to understanding and addressing the KeyError. These sections of the code are where the handling of 'empty_permitted' for forms and formsets is implemented, and therefore where the issue is most likely to be resolved.",

Specifically, setting form_kwargs = {'empty_permitted':True} or {'empty_permitted':False} leads to this error. The expected behavior is that 'empty_permitted' should be ignored for formset.empty_form since it is not meant to pass data or be validated.\n\nThe provided file_context and search_results contain several key sections related to formsets and model formsets in Django, particularly focusing on the BaseFormSet and BaseModelFormSet classes. These include the initialization of formsets and the construction of forms within them.\n\nOne important code span in the context is the 'BaseFormSet.empty_form' property, which is relevant as it defines how the empty_form is generated and handles the 'empty_permitted' parameter. Also, the 'BaseFormSet.__init__' method which initializes the formset and handles form_kwargs, is crucial for understanding how and where the 'empty_permitted' argument is integrated.\n\nThe new search results are mainly additional instance methods from the 'BaseModelFormSet' and 'BaseInlineFormSet' classes dealing with form initialization, construction, and data management. These expand your understanding of how these classes interact with the passed kwargs like 'empty_permitted'.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most relevant code spans for debugging and solving the reported issue are those from the 'BaseFormSet' class, particularly the 'empty_form' property, and the '__init__' method. These sections directly handle the creation and initialization of empty_form and how the 'empty_permitted' parameter is or should be treated.",

When the 'empty_form' property is accessed, it creates a new form instance with 'auto_id', 'prefix', 'empty_permitted', 'use_required_attribute', and 'renderer' arguments. However, the 'form_kwargs' that are passed during the initialization of 'BaseFormSet' are not directly used in this process. The 'empty_form' is instead instantiated using '**self.get_form_kwargs(None)', which suggests that this method is responsible for retrieving the necessary keyword arguments for the form's initialization. This omission might explain the occurrence of 'KeyError' when 'empty_permitted' is passed through 'form_kwargs', as 'form_kwargs' are not explicitly passed to the 'empty_form' constructor in this setup.",

This error suggests that the 'empty_permitted' parameter in form_kwargs is not correctly handled in the empty_form property of the BaseFormSet class in Django's forms.py. To address this, we need to ensure that the empty_form property correctly ignores 'empty_permitted' or handles it without causing a KeyError. The relevant code spans include the initialization of BaseFormSet, specifically the handling of form_kwargs in the __init__ method, and the definition of the empty_form property. Additionally, the get_form_kwargs method is relevant as it exposes the form_kwargs to the empty_form property. These code spans will help us understand how form_kwargs are passed and how they interact with the empty_form property.

The property 'empty_form' uses '**self.get_form_kwargs(None)' to create a new form instance, which may not include 'form_kwargs' specifically. This could be the cause of the 'KeyError' since 'empty_permitted' is passed via 'form_kwargs' but is not directly included in the 'empty_form' instantiation. The 'ModelFormSet' class in 'django/forms/models.py' also interacts with 'BaseFormSet', but it doesn't directly address the 'empty_permitted' issue in 'empty_form'.
