These classes handle the creation of forms within a formset, including the handling of 'empty_permitted' for individual forms. The _construct_form method in BaseFormSet specifically sets 'empty_permitted' to True for forms beyond the initial form count, which suggests that the handling of 'empty_permitted' for empty_form could be inferred from this behavior. Since the issue revolves around the handling of 'empty_permitted' for empty_form, and the code provided gives insight into how 'empty_permitted' is generally handled for forms in a formset, it appears that the relevant context for understanding the issue has been provided. Further, the BaseModelFormSet class also includes logic for handling instances and primary keys, which is relevant for the overall formset functionality but doesn't directly address 'empty_permitted' for empty_form. Given this analysis, it seems all relevant code contexts have been provided to understand the issue at hand.",
