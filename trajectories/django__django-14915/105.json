This could be due to changes in the Django codebase itself. The code snippet provided indicates that the issue arises when using a dictionary and checking for the presence of a ModelChoiceIteratorValue object as a key. The relevant files and classes to investigate are likely in the django/forms/models.py file where ModelChoiceIteratorValue is defined, and potentially in django/forms/widgets.py where the create_option method that uses these values is located. It would also be prudent to check if there are any changes in how objects need to be made hashable in the new version of Django.",

The search results reveal the definition of 'ModelChoiceIteratorValue' in 'django/forms/models.py', which is crucial for understanding the error. Additionally, the 'ChoiceWidget' class in 'django/forms/widgets.py' contains the 'create_option' method, which is directly linked to the issue. This method constructs options for the widget, and the problem arises when trying to use 'ModelChoiceIteratorValue' as a key in a dictionary. Interestingly, the 'django/utils/hashable.py' contains a method 'make_hashable' that addresses similar issues by converting non-hashable types to hashable ones. This could be a potential solution or reference for fixing the issue with 'ModelChoiceIteratorValue'.
