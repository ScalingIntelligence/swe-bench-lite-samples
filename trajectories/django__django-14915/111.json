Additionally, the 'ChoiceWidget' class and its 'create_option' method are relevant as they deal with widget options and attributes directly. During the analysis, it's noted that 'ModelChoiceIteratorValue' does not have a '__hash__' method, which could be the reason for the TypeError.

However, the class does not implement a __hash__ method, which is necessary for instances of the class to be usable as dictionary keys or in sets. The lack of a __hash__ method here is likely the cause of the 'TypeError: unhashable type: 'ModelChoiceIteratorValue' experienced after the Django upgrade. Related classes that involve ModelChoiceIteratorValue include ModelChoiceIterator and ModelChoiceField. Notably, the create_option method in django/forms/widgets.py involves creating options with potentially unhashable ModelChoiceIteratorValue instances, which can lead to issues if these instances must be used as dictionary keys or in set operations.

  "initial_message": "ModelChoiceIteratorValue is not hashable.\nDescription\n\t\nRecently I migrated from Django 3.0 to Django 3.1. In my code, I add custom data-* attributes to the select widget options. After the upgrade some of those options broke. Error is {TypeError}unhashable type: 'ModelChoiceIteratorValue'.\nExample (this one breaks):\n\tdef create_option(self, name, value, label, selected, index, subindex=None, attrs=None):\n\t\tcontext = super().create_option(name, value, label, selected, index, subindex, attrs)\n\t\tif not value:\n\t\t\treturn context\n\t\tif value in self.show_fields: # This is a dict {1: ['first_name', 'last_name']}\n\t\t\tcontext['attrs']['data-fields'] = json.dumps(self.show_fields[value])\nHowever, working with arrays is not an issue:\n\tdef create_option(self, name, value, label, selected, index, subindex=None, attrs=None):\n\t\tcontext = super().create_option(name, value, label, selected, index, subindex, attrs)\n\t\tif not value:\n\t\t\treturn context\n\t\tif value in allowed_values: # This is an array [1, 2]\n\t\t\t...\n"
