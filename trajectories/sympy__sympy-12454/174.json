This suggests that the method's logic for iterating over indices is flawed, as it attempts to access an index that is out of bounds for a 4x2 matrix. To address this, we need to search for the implementation of the is_upper method and possibly the __getitem__ method in the relevant files. Given the context provided, it appears that the implementation might be in one of the files related to matrices (sympy/matrices/matrices.py, sympy/matrices/dense.py, or sympy/matrices/sparse.py). We should focus on these files and look for the is_upper method and any related indexing logic.",

The provided code snippets from `sympy/matrices/dense.py` and `sympy/matrices/sparse.py` include implementations of `__getitem__`, which are responsible for accessing elements in the matrix. The issue likely arises within these methods when the index (3,2) is accessed, as it exceeds the matrix dimensions. Both `DenseMatrix` and `SparseMatrix` classes have `__getitem__` methods that handle indexing, and both include error handling specifically for out-of-bounds indices. These methods are directly relevant to the reported issue, as they involve checking and handling of matrix indices, which is where the error occurs. Therefore, these implementations should be reviewed and possibly adjusted to prevent the `IndexError` from occurring for matrices of non-square dimensions.",
