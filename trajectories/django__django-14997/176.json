Given this context, the key files and code spans to focus on are those that handle the migration process and the schema editing for SQLite. The `models.py`, `migrations.py`, and `schema.py` files in Django's database backend for SQLite are particularly relevant. The identified code spans in the `sqlite3/schema.py` file are directly involved in the process of adding and removing constraints, which aligns with the operations causing the error in the migration. Additionally, the `state.py` and `migration.py` files are relevant for understanding how Django handles the state of the project during migrations and how migrations are defined and applied.",

From the `ProjectState` class in 'django/db/migrations/state.py', it is evident that the `add_constraint` method is a crucial part of handling constraints during migrations in general. On the other hand, the `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class provided in 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py' shows a specialized handling of unique constraints for SQLite. This special handling was expected given the unique behavior of SQLite compared to other databases. However, there seems to be a difference in the handling of unique constraints, particularly those with additional specifications like conditions, expressions, or deferrability, which seems to be a possible source of the conflict. Particularly noteworthy is how SQLite deals with creating unique indices that involve fields and expressions like those found in the error message, which are prohibited in SQLite's context for creating indices. This is likely to be the crux of the issue, as the unique constraints created in migrations are not conforming to SQLite's limited capabilities in handling complex index expressions.",

From the `ProjectState` class in 'django/db/migrations/state.py', it is evident that the `add_constraint` method is a crucial part of handling constraints during migrations in general. On the other hand, the `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class provided in 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py' shows a specialized handling of unique constraints for SQLite. This special handling was expected given the unique behavior of SQLite compared to other databases. However, there seems to be a difference in the handling of unique constraints, particularly those with additional specifications like conditions, expressions, or deferrability, which seems to be a possible source of the conflict. Particularly noteworthy is how SQLite deals with creating unique indices that involve fields and expressions like those found in the error message, which are prohibited in SQLite's context for creating indices. This is likely to be the crux of the issue, as the unique constraints created in migrations are not conforming to SQLite's limited capabilities in handling complex index expressions.",
