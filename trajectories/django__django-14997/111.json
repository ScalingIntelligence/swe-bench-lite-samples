Given the error message indicating that the '.' operator is prohibited in index expressions, it's likely that the issue arises when attempting to alter a field that is part of a unique constraint, particularly when using F expressions.

The relevant code spans from the provided search results include the `alter_field` method in both the base schema editor (BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor) and the SQLite-specific schema editor (DatabaseSchemaEditor).

During the initialization, expressions are converted to `F` expressions if they are in string format, suggesting that `F` expressions are expected to be used in the constraints.

The error message indicates that the '.' operator is prohibited in index expressions. This points to an issue with how SQLite handles certain types of constraints or expressions during schema alterations.\n\n2. Reviewed the current file context: The file context provided includes sections from 'django/db/backends/base/schema.py' and 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py'. These files contain the base and SQLite-specific schema editor classes. The 'alter_field' method and '_remake_table' method are particularly relevant as they handle field alterations and table recreations, which are likely part of the migration process.\n\n3. Processed new search results:\n   - Relevant sections identified in 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py':\n     - 'DatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_field': Handles field alterations, including checking if a column is referenced by foreign key constraints and potentially remaking the table.\n     - 'DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table': Method to remake the table, which might be necessary when altering fields that affect unique constraints.\n     - 'DatabaseSchemaEditor._alter_field': Contains logic for altering fields including unique constraints.\n\n4. Decided on relevance and completeness: The identified sections provide a comprehensive view of how field alterations and table modifications are handled in the SQLite backend of Django. The '_remake_table' method is particularly crucial as it seems to deal directly with the issue of remaking tables when constraints are involved. This is likely where the error related to the '.' operator prohibited in index expressions would be addressed or encountered. Therefore, these sections are highly relevant to the reported issue.",

The code snippet from 'django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py' contains the `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class, which includes methods like `alter_field` and `_remake_table`, which handle the modification of fields and table reconstruction respectively. These methods are crucial for understanding how SQLite handles migrations and schema alterations, which is directly related to the reported issue of table remaking with unique constraints crashing on SQLite. Additionally, the 'django/db/models/constraints.py' file encompasses the `UniqueConstraint` class, detailing how unique constraints are implemented, including handling expressions and conditions that might be related to the error due to the use of the '.' operator in index expressions. Despite these comprehensive insights, the specific error related to the '.' operator not being allowed in index expressions was not directly addressed in the provided file context, suggesting a potential gap in understanding the exact implementation causing the crash. Further investigation into how SQL expressions are constructed and executed for SQLite in Django might be needed.",
