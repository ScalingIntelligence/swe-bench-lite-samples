The error message indicates that the \".\" operator is prohibited in index expressions, suggesting that the problem might be in how the constraint is being defined or applied. Given the provided context, it seems relevant to focus on the schema and constraint definition in the Django ORM, specifically in the SQLite backend. The traceback points to parts of Django's SQLite schema handling, so it's crucial to inspect the methods involved in altering fields and adding constraints, such as `_remake_table` and `_alter_field` in the `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class for SQLite. Additionally, the `UniqueConstraint` class and its methods for generating constraint SQL might also be relevant.",

These files contain classes and methods related to database schema editing and constraints, which are likely to be involved in the problem. Specifically, the 'DatabaseSchemaEditor' class in 'schema.py' contains methods like 'add_constraint', 'remove_constraint', and '_remake_table' that are critical for altering the database schema, including adding unique constraints. The 'UniqueConstraint' class in 'constraints.py' is also relevant as it defines how unique constraints are created and managed.
