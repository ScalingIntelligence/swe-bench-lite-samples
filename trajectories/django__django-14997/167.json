The error is related to the 'dot' operator being prohibited in index expressions, which suggests a problem in the SQL generation or execution phases of the Django ORM's SQLite backend. Given the error message and the context, it seems pertinent to focus on the schema modifications and constraint handling parts of the Django codebase, particularly within the SQLite backend's schema and operations modules. These areas handle the SQL transformations and execution necessary for schema migrations and constraints. By targeting these parts, we can better understand what causes the migration to fail specifically due to SQLite's limitations with index expressions.",
