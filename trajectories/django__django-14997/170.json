The error specifically mentions the '._.' operator being prohibited in index expressions, which suggests that SQLite might not support the syntax used in the constraint definition. The search results provided include several relevant code spans in files related to Django's database schema manipulation and constraint handling.\n\nThe `DatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is particularly relevant because it contains methods for altering fields and remaking tables, which are central to the migration process. Specifically, the `_alter_field`, `_remake_table`, and `add_constraint` methods are of interest because they deal with altering database schema elements, including constraints.\n\nThe `UniqueConstraint` class defined in `django/db/models/constraints.py` is also relevant as it covers the initialization and SQL generation for unique constraints. The `__init__`, `contains_expressions`, `_get_condition_sql`, and `constraint_sql` methods within this class would be examined to understand how unique constraints are handled and potentially why they might fail in SQLite.\n\nLastly, the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` is examined for its `_alter_field` method, which is involved in altering fields during migrations and might provide further insights into the error's root cause.\n\nBy analyzing these code spans, it's possible to understand how Django handles database schema changes, including the creation and modification of unique constraints, and identify any SQLite-specific issues or limitations that might contribute to the reported error.",
