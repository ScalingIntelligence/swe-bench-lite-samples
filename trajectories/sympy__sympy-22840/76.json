The provided code example demonstrates the unexpected output where `cse()` returns `x0` and `x2` as copies of the matrices `a` and `b`, respectively. This suggests that the problem might be in how `cse()` handles `MatrixSymbol` objects, particularly their indexing. To investigate this further, I'll first look at the `cse()` function and related utilities to see how they process `MatrixSymbol` objects and their indices. I'll focus on whether the indexing operation is being correctly interpreted or if there might be a bug in handling these operations. Since `cse()` involves common subexpression elimination, it's crucial to ensure that matrix elements are correctly represented and substituted before this optimization step. Given the context provided, it seems that the relevant code spans from the handling of `MatrixSymbol` in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` to the actual implementation of `cse()` in `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py`. The search results include code spans related to `MatrixSymbol` handling, `MatMul`, `ElementwiseApplyFunction`, `Trace`, and `HadamardPower`. These are relevant as they deal with operations on matrices and thus could influence how `MatrixSymbol` is processed inside `cse()`. Specifically, `_eval_derivative_matrix_lines` functions in these classes deal with handling derivatives in matrix operations, indicating potential interdependencies worth exploring in relation to the issue at hand. Overall, to address the reported issue effectively, understanding how `MatrixSymbol` indices are managed and processed throughout these functions and classes within the codebase and ensuring consistency in these operations is key. This will enable identifying where normalization or substitution of matrix symbols might go awry.",
