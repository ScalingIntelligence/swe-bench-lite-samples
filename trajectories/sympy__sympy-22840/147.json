The main concern is how the `cse()` function handles the substitution and common subexpression elimination specifically with `MatrixSymbol` objects. This requires looking into how `MatrixSymbol` and the `cse()` function are implemented and processed within the SymPy library.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the code spans from `matexpr.py`, `matmul.py`, `ast.py`, and `cse_main.py` are highly relevant as they cover the implementation and handling of `MatrixExpr`, `MatMul`, `MatrixSymbol`, and the actual `cse()` function respectively. Additionally, the `doit()` method in `MatMul` would also be relevant for understanding how matrix operations such as multiplication are reduced to their final form, potentially affecting the `cse()` output.\n\nTherefore, the identified spans involve the core components and operations related to `MatrixSymbol` and common subexpression elimination, making them directly relevant to the reported issue.",

We need to refocus on dealing with `MatrixSymbol` within the `cse()` function. Specifically, we should ensure that `MatrixSymbol` indexing is handled efficiently, preventing the creation of unnecessary matrix copies.\n\nGiven the example provided, it seems `cse()` is attempting to simplify expressions involving `MatrixSymbol`, but instead, it's creating opaque intermediate variables, making the final output less understandable and less efficient. We need to ensure that direct indexing of `MatrixSymbol` is preserved throughout the optimization process unless absolutely necessary.\n\nFor the next step, I will propose a change to ensure that `MatrixSymbol` instances are not unnecessarily duplicated during the simplification process. This involves a careful strategy within the `cse()` function to recognize when `MatrixSymbol` is being processed and to avoid the creation of new symbols representing whole copies of the matrix.",

Specifically, ensure that `MatrixSymbol` instances are processed such that they are not fully duplicated during the CSE. Instead, only necessary elements or sub-expressions of the matrix should be symbolically referenced and replaced, ensuring the matrix remains in a symbolic form rather than creating multiple full copies of the matrix.\n\nThe request specifies that the `cse()` function must be altered to treat `MatrixSymbol` instances differently, avoiding full duplication and instead handling only necessary elements or sub-expressions. However, the detailed modification instructions encompass a broad range of the function's matrix handling logic, which extends beyond the token limit. This requires a specific focus on lines where the function deals with matrices.",
