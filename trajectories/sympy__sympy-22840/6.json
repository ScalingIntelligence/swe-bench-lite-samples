Specifically, the issue refers to unexpected results when using MatrixSymbol in the context of common subexpression elimination (CSE). To address this issue, it is crucial to identify and understand the code responsible for CSE and the handling of MatrixSymbol objects.\n\nI analyzed the provided search results to find relevant code spans. The file 'sympy/simplify/cse_main.py' contains several key functions related to CSE, such as 'match_common_args', 'opt_cse', 'tree_cse', and 'cse'. The 'cse' function is the main entry point for the CSE process, which uses other functions like 'tree_cse' and 'opt_cse' to optimize expressions. Additionally, the file 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' contains the 'MatrixSymbol' class and its related methods, which are essential for understanding how MatrixSymbols are handled in expressions.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue and the provided context, the code spans related to the CSE process and the handling of MatrixSymbols are relevant. Thus, I have identified the following code spans in the 'sympy/simplify/cse_main.py' and 'sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py' as pertinent to understanding and potentially resolving the issue:\n\n- sympy/simplify/cse_main.py, span 'match_common_args': This function is responsible for identifying common arguments in functions, which is a key part of the CSE process.\n- sympy/simplify/cse_main.py, span 'opt_cse': This function optimizes expressions before the CSE process, potentially affecting how MatrixSymbol objects are handled.\n- sympy/simplify/cse_main.py, span 'tree_cse': This function performs CSE by building a tree of expressions, which is essential for understanding how MatrixSymbol indexing affects the results.\n- sympy/simplify/cse_main.py, span 'cse': This is the main function for performing CSE, using the previously mentioned functions and more.\n- sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py, span 'MatrixSymbol': This class and its methods are central to understanding how MatrixSymbols are defined and used in expressions.",
