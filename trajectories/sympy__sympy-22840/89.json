Specifically, it appears that `cse()` is incorrectly treating MatrixSymbols as scalar values instead of treating them as matrices. Given that `cse()` stands for Common Subexpression Elimination, it's likely implemented in files related to expression simplification or matrix operations. Previous files have shown some relevant functions and classes, such as `cse` in `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py` and various matrix-related classes and methods in `sympy/matrices/matrices.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/`. Considering these points, focusing the search on `cse` and `MatrixSymbol` for code snippets or classes/functions related to these might be the best approach.",
