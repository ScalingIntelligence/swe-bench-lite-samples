This issue is particularly concerned with how the cse() function processes matrices defined by MatrixSymbol in terms of their indexing. The provided context and search results strongly suggest that the issue lies within the handling of MatrixSymbols by the cse() function in the sympy.simplify.cse_main module. The 'cse' span in sympy/simplify/cse_main.py particularly stands out as it contains the implementation of the cse() function which should be examined for its interaction with MatrixSymbols. Based on the reported issue, the line that introduces the strange behavior is where the cse() results are being substituted and printed. The relevant code spans are those that include the cse() function and its associated optimizations and preprocessing functions, which are all located within the sympy.simplify.cse_main module. These functions directly deal with the common subexpression elimination process, including the optimization phase (opt_cse) and preprocessing phase (preprocess_for_cse), which could be where the problem arises concerning the handling of MatrixSymbols.
