The search results include detailed implementations of functions such as `opt_cse()` and `cse()` in the `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py` file. These functions are directly related to the Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) process, which is likely where the issue is arising. By examining these functions, we can identify the code spans that handle matrix symbols and indexing, which will help in understanding the root cause of the reported issue. The `cse()` function seems to be central to the issue, as it involves preprocessing, optimizing, and postprocessing expressions that include matrix symbols. The `opt_cse()` function also plays a crucial role in optimizing expressions before the CSE process, which could be where the problem with MatrixSymbol indexing occurs.",
