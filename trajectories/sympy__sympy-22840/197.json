This suggests that the problem might be related to the `cse` function itself or how MatrixSymbol is being handled in matrix operations. Given the context provided, it appears that the `cse` function in `sympy.simplify.cse_main` and the `MatrixSymbol` class in `sympy.matrices.expressions.matexpr` are potential places to start investigating. Additionally, since the example provided involves matrix multiplication and the `cse` function's output, it's also relevant to check `sympy.matrices.expressions.matmul` for any issues related to matrix multiplication with MatrixSymbols.",

The user provides an example showcasing the computation of common subexpressions (CSE) for a product of two 4x4 matrices composed of symbols, expecting a certain output that matches the indexing of the original matrices. The problematic output suggests that `x0` and `x2` are copies of the matrices `a` and `b`, respectively, and the rest of the output involves unexpected index ranges. Key functions involved are `cse()`, `MatrixSymbol`, and potentially `MatMul` within the SymPy library.\n\nAnalyzing the provided search results, the relevant files seem to be `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py`, `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py`, and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. Within these files, several key functions and classes appear to be linked to CSE and matrix operations: `cse()`, `MatrixSymbol`, `MatMul`, and various related eval and property methods like `shape`, `_entry`, `could_extract_minus_sign`, `_eval_adjoint`, and others. Each of these elements within the search results plays a role in the behavior of CSE operations with matrices and matrix symbols.
