These sections are critical for understanding the expected behavior and potential issues with `cse()` for `MatrixSymbol` indexing.\n\n1. `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py` contains the main implementation of the `cse()` function, which is central to the reported issue. It includes methods for preprocessing, finding common subexpressions, and postprocessing. The `cse()` function is responsible for identifying common subexpressions and substituting them with unique symbols to optimize expressions. This directly relates to the issue of strange behavior when using `MatrixSymbol`.\n\n2. `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` includes the definition of `MatrixSymbol`, along with methods for handling its shape, name, and elements. This section is crucial for understanding the behavior of `MatrixSymbol` and how it might interact with the `cse()` function. In particular, the methods related to shape and indexing (`shape`, `name`, `_entry`) are relevant.\n\nBy analyzing these sections of code, we can identify the specific parts of the codebase that are pertinent to resolving the reported issue.
