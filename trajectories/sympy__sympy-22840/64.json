To address this, we need to look at how `cse()` and `MatrixSymbol` are implemented in the codebase. The `cse()` function is responsible for common subexpression elimination, which involves identifying and replacing repeated subexpressions with temporary variables. The `MatrixSymbol` class represents a symbolic matrix, and its indexing behavior might be causing the issue when used within `cse()`. The search results show relevant code spans in `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, specifically: 1. `cse()`: The main function in `cse_main.py` that performs common subexpression elimination. 2. `MatrixSymbol`: The class definition and its methods in `matexpr.py` that handle symbolic matrix operations. Based on the issue description, the focus should be on the interaction between `cse()` and `MatrixSymbol` indexing, which suggests that the relevant code spans are those where `MatrixSymbol` interacts with expressions being processed by `cse()`. This includes the `cse()` function itself, and any helper functions used within it, as well as the `MatrixSymbol` class definition and its methods related to indexing and evaluation.",
