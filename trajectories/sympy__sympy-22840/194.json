The user provides an example illustrating the issue, where after using `cse()` on an expression involving MatrixSymbols, the output results in copies of the original matrices rather than properly indexed elements. The primary focus is on the functionality of `cse()` within the context of MatrixSymbols. The search results include sections of code from the `sympy` library, particularly focusing on the `cse_main.py`, `matexpr.py`, and `matmul.py` files. These files contain various functions and classes relevant to common subexpression elimination (CSE), MatrixSymbol handling, and matrix multiplication, which are likely to be involved when addressing the reported issue.\n\nHeuristically, `cse_main.py` contains functionalities that handle CSE across different expressions and types, potentially including MatrixSymbols. The `matexpr.py` file defines the `MatrixSymbol` class, which is crucial for understanding how MatrixSymbols are created and handled within SymPy. The `matmul.py` file includes the `MatMul` class, important for operations involving matrix multiplication, which is also pivotal in the provided example.\n\nFrom these search results, the most relevant code sections seem to be those dealing with how MatrixSymbols are indexed and how CSE is applied to expressions containing them. These sections likely hold keys to understanding why the copies of matrices are being output instead of expected indexed elements.",
