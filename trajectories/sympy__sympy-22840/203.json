The code provided demonstrates how the `cse()` function is applied to expressions involving `MatrixSymbol`. The goal is to identify the root cause of this behavior. From the context, it appears that the `cse()` function might not be handling `MatrixSymbol` instances correctly, leading to unexpected outputs. We should search for the `cse()` function definition and related code in the SymPy library, particularly in files related to matrix operations and code simplification.",
