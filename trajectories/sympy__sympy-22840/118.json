Specifically, the `MatrixSymbol` class and its methods are defined here, such as `MatrixSymbol.__new__`, `MatrixSymbol.shape`, `MatrixSymbol.name`, `MatrixSymbol._entry`, and `MatrixSymbol.free_symbols`. These methods are relevant for the creation and manipulation of `MatrixSymbol` objects, which are central to the reported issue.\n2. **sympy/simplify/cse_main.py**: This file contains the `cse()` function, which is the main function under investigation for the reported issue. The `cse()` function and supporting functions like `opt_cse()` and `postprocess_for_cse()` are relevant for the common subexpression elimination (CSE) process, which includes operations on `MatrixSymbol` indexing.\n3. **sympy/codegen/ast.py**: This file contains the `CodeBlock.cse()` method, which also involves the `cse()` function from `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py`. This method is relevant for the application of CSE in a code generation context.\n\nGiven the search results, it's now clear that the relevant code spans are located in the `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` and `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py` files.
