However, the output shows that `x0` and `x2` are copies of the matrices `a` and `b`, which is not the expected behavior for `MatrixSymbol` indexing.\n\nFrom the search results, the files `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`, `sympy/codegen/ast.py`, and `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py` seem relevant to the issue. The `MatrixSymbol` class in `matexpr.py` is likely where the handling of matrix symbols, including their indexing, is defined. In `cse_main.py`, the `cse` function is found, which is the main function for common subexpression elimination and is likely where the issue is occurring. Additionally, `CodeBlock.cse` in `ast.py` extends the functionality of `cse()` within a code block context.\n\nGiven the reported issue, the relevant code spans are expected to be within these functions or classes that deal with the creation, manipulation, and optimization of matrix expressions, particularly involving `MatrixSymbol`.\n\nSeeking for details on the handling of `MatrixSymbol` instances and their expressions within these code spans should reveal how the subexpression elimination process works with `MatrixSymbol` and identify if there's a discrepancy regarding indexing behavior.",
