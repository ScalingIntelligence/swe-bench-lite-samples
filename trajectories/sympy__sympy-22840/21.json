Specifically, the issue arises when using `MatrixSymbol` objects in common subexpression elimination (CSE). The provided example demonstrates that `x0` and `x2` appear as full copies of matrices `a` and `b`, respectively, rather than just referencing the elements needed for the computation. This suggests that the CSE process might not be handling matrix element indexing correctly. The main focus should be on the implementation of `MatrixSymbol` and the CSE algorithms. From the file context and search results, it's evident that the code spans for `MatrixSymbol` and the `cse` function within `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` and `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py` are the critical areas to investigate. These sections provide the necessary context to understand how `MatrixSymbol` objects are created, accessed, and how the CSE process operates. By examining the properties, methods, and potential issues in the handling of matrix elements during CSE, we can pinpoint the exact code spans relevant to the reported issue.",
