The provided example demonstrates that `cse()` is treating `MatrixSymbol` objects like arrays, leading to unexpected output where `cse()` creates multiple temporary variables for each element in the matrix rather than maintaining the matrix structure. The relevant code spans should include portions that deal with `MatrixSymbol` handling within the context of `cse()`, specifically looking at how `MatrixSymbol` is treated differently from matrices containing actual symbols.\n\nFrom the search results, the most relevant file is `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py`, specifically the `cse` function, which is central to the Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) process. This function is where the `MatrixSymbol` objects would be encountered and processed. Further, the `opt_cse` function within the same file may also be relevant as it performs optimizations related to CSE. Given the issue about matrix behavior, the code spans around matrix handling within `cse` and `opt_cse` will be most pertinent. Additionally, checking how `MatrixSymbol` is defined in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` can provide insight into the operations supported or problematic for `MatrixSymbol`.\n\nKeywords extracted from the issue: `cse`, `MatrixSymbol`, `indexing`, `strange behavior`.\n\nPossibly relevant sections: `cse`, `opt_cse` for CSE logic, and `MatrixSymbol` for object definition.",
