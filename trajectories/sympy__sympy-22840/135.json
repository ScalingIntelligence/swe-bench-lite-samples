Specifically, the `MatrixSymbol` class definition and the `cse` function in `sympy.simplify.cse_main` are relevant to understand the behavior of `cse()` with matrices. Additionally, the `CodeBlock.cse` method in `sympy.codegen.ast` provides an integrated approach to CSE for code generation contexts, which might also be relevant for a comprehensive understanding.
