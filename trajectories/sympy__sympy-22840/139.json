From the example provided and the output, it's clear that the common subexpression elimination (CSE) is not handling MatrixSymbols as expected, leading to redundant and incorrect intermediate expressions. The primary function of interest is cse(), and the relevant files identified from the file context suggest that cse() might be implemented or at least influenced by sympy/simplify/cse_main.py. Additional relevant files are related to matrix expressions and their handling within the sympy library. Therefore, I will focus the search on files related to matrix operations (including MatrixSymbol and their operations) and the cse() function. Specifically, I will look for the cse() function definition and how it interacts with MatrixSymbols.",
