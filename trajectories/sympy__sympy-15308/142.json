The expected LaTeX output should reflect the matrix operations properly, but the current output does not recognize Trace and does not apply the LaTeX printer appropriately for the inner expression. Analysis of the provided search results reveals two critical files and their corresponding methods that might address the issue. The first file, 'sympy/printing/latex.py', contains the LatexPrinter class which is responsible for generating LaTeX code. Specifically, the method '_print_Pow' is relevant as it handles the printing of power expressions, which includes matrix squares. The method '_print_MatrixBase' is also pertinent as it deals with printing matrices, which is a fundamental part of the given expression. The second file, 'sympy/matrices/expressions/trace.py', contains the Trace class and its associated methods that might be influencing the LaTeX printing, particularly the 'doit' method which computes the trace of a matrix. Additionally, the 'trace' function that calls the 'doit' method could also be relevant. These methods and classes should be examined to determine why the LaTeX printer is not applying correctly for Trace and inner matrix expressions, and how to update the printer to handle these scenarios appropriately.",
