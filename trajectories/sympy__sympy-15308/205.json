The issue involves two main aspects: the handling of the 'Trace' function and the printing of matrix powers. From the provided context and search results, the relevant code spans are found in the 'LatexPrinter' class in 'sympy/printing/latex.py'. The '_print_Pow' method handles the LaTeX printing for powers, including matrix powers, and thus is relevant for the 'A**2' part of the issue. Additionally, the '_print_MatrixBase' method, also in 'LatexPrinter', is responsible for printing matrices, making it relevant for the matrix expression involving 'A'. The '_print_Trace' method, though not directly provided in the context, might be needed to handle the 'Trace' function's LaTeX printing. However, since '_print_Trace' isn't present, it's inferred that it might be implemented elsewhere in the codebase or needs to be implemented.
