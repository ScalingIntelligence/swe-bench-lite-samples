From the search results, the relevant classes are LatexPrinter in sympy/printing/latex.py and PrettyPrinter in sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py. The LatexPrinter class contains the method _print_Pow which handles the printing of powers and should be modified to correctly handle the case of matrices. Similarly, the _print_MatrixBase method in LatexPrinter should also be reviewed to ensure correct LaTeX printing for matrix expressions. Additionally, the _print_Trace method needs to be addressed as it is directly related to the trace function. In PrettyPrinter, the _print_Trace method should be inspected to ensure the pretty printing aligns with LaTeX formatting. Overall, the relevant code spans are LatexPrinter._print_Pow, LatexPrinter._print_MatrixBase, and LatexPrinter._print_Trace in latex.py, and PrettyPrinter._print_Trace in pretty.py.",
