The expected output for latex(trace(A**2)) should be 'Trace(A^2)', but currently it is 'Trace(A**2)', which is incorrect because it doesn't fallback to the LaTeX printer for the inner expression. Based on the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in the LatexPrinter class within the sympy/printing/latex.py file. Specifically, the methods _print_Pow and _print_TensAdd seem to be related to the handling of powers and tensor addition, which could be relevant for the LaTeX printing of matrix expressions. The existing context also includes the LatexPrinter class with its __init__ method and the _default_settings attribute, which is related to the printer's configuration, but since the issue can be resolved independently, this context is not necessary. Using the provided search results, we can identify the relevant code spans that deal with the printing of mathematical expressions, specifically focusing on how powers and addition are handled. This will allow us to pinpoint where the issue might be occurring and identify the code spans that need to be addressed to implement the correct fallback mechanism for the LaTeX printing.",
