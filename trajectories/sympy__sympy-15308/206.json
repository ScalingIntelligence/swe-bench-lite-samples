The expected LaTeX representation should include the power operation on the matrix (A^2), but the current output is 'Trace(A**2)', which does not use the LaTeX power notation. The search results include both LaTeX and pretty printing modules from SymPy, which are likely relevant for addressing the issue. The LatexPrinter class in the latex.py file is responsible for converting SymPy expressions to LaTeX, and the Trace class in the trace.py file handles the trace operation on matrices. The PrettyPrinter class also includes a method for printing the trace of a matrix, which could be relevant if the LaTeX printer uses a similar approach. The identified spans include the LatexPrinter class and its initialization, the Trace class and its methods, and the PrettyPrinter's method for handling the trace operation. These spans are relevant as they contain the logic for generating LaTeX and pretty representations of the trace operation on matrices, which is directly related to the reported issue. The search results provide a good starting point for addressing the issue, but further examination of how these printers handle the power operation on matrices (e.g., A^2) is necessary to fully address the issue.",
