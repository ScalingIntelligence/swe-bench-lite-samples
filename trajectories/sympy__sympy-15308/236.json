The issue specifically mentions a problem with the LaTeX printer not falling back to the LaTeX printer for the inner expression. The provided file context shows the 'LatexPrinter' class from sympy.printing.latex, which includes methods for handling Power expressions (_print_Pow). The search results include the 'LatexPrinter' class again, but we need to focus on the part that handles the power expression for matrices specifically. Since the issue involves a matrix expression, it's crucial to identify how the LaTeX printer handles matrix expressions, particularly when they are raised to a power. The search results include a method '_print_MatPow' in the 'PrettyPrinter' class from sympy.printing.pretty, which suggests that there might be a specific handling for matrix powers in the pretty printer.
