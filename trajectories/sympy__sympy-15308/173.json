The `Trace` function seems to not be recognized, and the printer for the inner expression (`A**2`) does not fallback to the LaTeX printer as expected. Relevant files could include those related to LaTeX printing (`sympy/printing/latex.py`), pretty printing (`sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`), and the trace function (`sympy/matrices/expressions/trace.py`). Additionally, files handling matrix expressions (`sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`) and string printing for matrices (`sympy/printing/str.py`) might also be pertinent. The focus should be on functions and classes that handle LaTeX printing, Trace function, and matrix expressions.",

The expected output should be 'A^2' wrapped in a trace function, but the current output is 'Trace(A**2)' which does not use LaTeX formatting for 'A**2'. The relevant code spans are identified based on functions responsible for LaTeX printing of matrix and power expressions. The _print_Pow method in LatexPrinter handles LaTeX rendering of powers, which is crucial for 'A**2'. The _print_Trace method in PrettyPrinter is also relevant as it is responsible for pretty printing the trace function, which needs to be checked for LaTeX compatibility. Furthermore, the _print_MatrixBase method in LatexPrinter is relevant for general matrix LaTeX printing. These methods need to be checked and potentially modified to ensure proper LaTeX formatting of matrix expressions within trace functions.",
