This suggests that the LaTeX printer for `Trace` is not working correctly or is not being invoked properly. The analysis needs to focus on the `LatexPrinter` class and how it handles `Trace` and `Pow` (for the matrix exponentiation). From the current context, it's clear that `Trace` is defined in `sympy/matrices/expressions/trace.py`, and there's a method `_print_Pow` in `LatexPrinter` that handles how powers are printed in LaTeX. The search results confirm the existence of the `_print_Pow` method in `LatexPrinter`, which is responsible for printing power expressions. It appears that the `_print_Pow` method should be the focus for correction since it's responsible for formatting powers in LaTeX, including those in matrix expressions. Identifying the specific span related to `_print_Pow` should be sufficient for addressing the issue.",
