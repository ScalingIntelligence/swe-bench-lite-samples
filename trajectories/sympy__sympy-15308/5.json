This suggests that the `LatexPrinter` class may not have the appropriate method for handling `Trace` objects or may not be correctly delegating to the inner expression's printer. The relevant files identified so far include `sympy/printing/latex.py`, `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`, and `sympy/matrices/expressions/trace.py`. We need to focus on the `LatexPrinter` class methods and ensure that `_print_Trace` and `_print_Pow` are correctly implemented and utilized.",
