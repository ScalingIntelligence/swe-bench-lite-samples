These spans are crucial for understanding how the Trace of a matrix and matrix operations are currently printed in LaTeX. Additionally, the spans `PrettyPrinter._print_MatPow` and `LatexPrinter._print_Transpose` are relevant as they handle the printing of matrix power and transpose, respectively. Given the issue's requirement for a fallback to the LaTeX printer for inner expressions, these spans will be instrumental in identifying the necessary code modifications or enhancements.",
