The key parts of the code involved are `BaseDatabaseCreation.serialize_db_to_string`, `BaseDatabaseCreation.deserialize_db_from_string`, and `TransactionTestCase._fixture_setup`. The main concern is that `deserialize_db_from_string` does not wrap its operations in a transaction, leading to potential integrity errors due to the saving order of objects. Given the complexity and specific nature of the problem, it is crucial to focus on the database creation methods and related serialization/deserialization processes.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about the `TransactionTestCase`'s `serialized_rollback` functionality failing due to ordering constraints when restoring objects. This occurs specifically when `serialized_rollback = True` triggers the rollback emulation. The core of the issue is that the `serialize_db_to_string` method orders models using `serializers.sort_dependencies` and serializes them, but this sorting algorithm doesn't ensure foreign key referenced models are serialized before the models containing the foreign keys. The consequence is that when `deserialize_db_from_string` is called, it can result in integrity errors because an object containing a foreign key might be saved before the object it references, due to the lack of transaction wrapping in `deserialize_db_from_string`. The suggested fix is to wrap the `deserialize_db_from_string` code in a transaction to prevent such integrity errors.\n\nCurrent file context shows that `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` contains the `deserialize_db_from_string` method without the necessary transaction wrapping, and it also shows the sorting mechanism in `django/core/serializers/__init__.py` which is relevant to understanding the issue. Additionally, `django/db/transaction.py` provides the `atomic` transaction utility, which is essential for implementing the suggested fix.\n\nThe new search results in `django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py` provide context on how `loaddata` command handles fixture loading within a transaction, which serves as a reference for how to correctly implement transaction wrapping in `deserialize_db_from_string`. The `Command` class in `loaddata.py` showcases how to use `transaction.atomic` around fixture loading, which is directly relevant to the suggested fix for the `deserialize_db_from_string` method in `creation.py`.\n\nThis search results analysis confirms the relevance of the new search results to the reported issue. The `loaddata.py` file demonstrates the correct usage of transactions, which should be applied to `deserialize_db_from_string` in `creation.py` to address the integrity errors during rollback emulation.",

  "initial_message": "`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints\nDescription\n\t\nI hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n"
