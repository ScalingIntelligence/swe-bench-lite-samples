The suggested solution is to wrap the deserialization process in a transaction to ensure all deserialized objects are saved correctly. To address this, we need to locate the relevant sections of code where serialization and deserialization take place, particularly focusing on the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class and its methods `serialize_db_to_string` and `deserialize_db_from_string`. We should also look for any related methods or functions that interact with these processes, such as `sort_dependencies` in the serializers module.",

Specifically, when `serialized_rollback = True`, `BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db` calls `serialize_db_to_string` which orders models using `serializers.sort_dependencies`. However, this sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys and doesn't handle foreign keys, leading to integrity errors in `deserialize_db_from_string`. The proposed fix suggests wrapping `deserialize_db_from_string` in a transaction to prevent these errors. \n\nIn the provided search results, the relevant code spans are found in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` within the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class. The method `deserialize_db_from_string` is identified as the primary focus since it directly involves the deserialization process that can fail due to the aforementioned ordering issues. Additionally, the `sort_dependencies` function in `django/core/serializers/__init__.py` is also relevant as it contributes to the sorting of models during serialization, which is part of the problem described in the issue.

Specifically, the `serialize_db_to_string` method orders models using `serializers.sort_dependencies`, which doesn't ensure that models with foreign keys are saved before models containing those foreign keys. As a result, `deserialize_db_from_string` encounters integrity errors because it saves objects without wrapping the process in a transaction. The suggested fix is to wrap the deserialization process in a transaction to avoid these errors.\n\nThe provided file context and search results both provide relevant code spans related to this issue. The file `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` contains methods `serialize_db_to_string` and `deserialize_db_from_string`, both of which are directly related to the problem. The `serialize_db_to_string` method uses `serializers.sort_dependencies` to order models, and `deserialize_db_from_string` deserializes and saves models without a transaction.\n\nGiven these findings, all relevant code spans related to the reported issue have been identified in the file `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`.",

  "initial_message": "`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints\nDescription\n\t\nI hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n"
