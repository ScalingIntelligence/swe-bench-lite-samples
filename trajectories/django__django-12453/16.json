This failure is attributed to the `serialize_db_to_string` and `deserialize_db_from_string` methods in the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class. The critical point is that `deserialize_db_from_string` does not wrap its operations in a transaction, leading to integrity errors due to the order of saving model instances that contain foreign keys. To resolve this, it's suggested to wrap the deserialization process in a transaction. I will focus the search on the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class and relevant methods within the `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` file, particularly targeting the `deserialize_db_from_string` method where the transaction should be applied.",

The provided search results contain relevant code spans from `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` which include the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class and its methods such as `create_test_db`, `serialize_db_to_string`, and `deserialize_db_from_string`. These methods handle the serialization and deserialization process as mentioned in the issue description. Notably, `serialize_db_to_string` uses `serializers.sort_dependencies` to order models and then serialize them, while `deserialize_db_from_string` deserializes and saves the models without a transaction. This setup aligns with the issue, especially the part that suggests wrapping the deserialization in a transaction to avoid integrity errors due to foreign key constraints.\n\nThe relevant code spans are identified because they directly relate to the serialization and deserialization processes described in the issue. The lack of transaction wrapping around the deserialization process in `deserialize_db_from_string` is particularly relevant as it is a key point of the issue and the proposed solution.\n\nBy identifying and analyzing these spans, it is clear that the provided code is directly related to the reported issue, particularly focusing on how database operations are handled during the test setup. This includes the serialization of the database contents, which is then deserialized during rollback emulation in the `TransactionTestCase`, and the need to ensure foreign key constraints are respected during this process.",

  "initial_message": "`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints\nDescription\n\t\nI hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n"
