The main concern is that the current implementation of serialize_db_to_string and deserialize_db_from_string does not ensure that objects are saved in the correct order to avoid integrity errors due to foreign key constraints. The suggested solution involves wrapping the deserialization process in a transaction to ensure atomicity. The provided search results include the sort_dependencies function from django/core/serializers/__init__.py, which is relevant to the serialization order of models but does not address the deserialization process directly. Additionally, the loaddata function from django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py is provided, which shows how the loading of fixtures is wrapped in a transaction, suggesting a potential solution for the problematic deserialize_db_from_string function.

The root cause identified is that while `serialize_db_to_string` orders models using `serializers.sort_dependencies` based on natural keys, `deserialize_db_from_string` does not handle the deserialization within a transaction, leading to potential integrity errors. The provided patch suggests wrapping the deserialization process within a transaction to handle foreign key constraints properly.\n\nFrom the file context, we have a clear understanding of the current sorting mechanism in `serializers.sort_dependencies`, which orders models based on natural keys but does not account for foreign key dependencies. Additionally, we see that the `loaddata` command in `django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py` already handles the process within a transaction, which aligns with the proposed solution.\n\nThe new search results provide the current implementation of `deserialize_db_from_string` in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`, which does not use a transaction during deserialization. This directly supports the need for the proposed change to include a transaction to prevent integrity errors due to foreign key constraints.\n\nBased on this analysis, the identified relevant code spans are from the `deserialize_db_from_string` method in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`.",

  "initial_message": "`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints\nDescription\n\t\nI hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n"
