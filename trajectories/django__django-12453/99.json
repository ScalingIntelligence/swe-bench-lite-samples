The main code areas to focus on are the `serialize_db_to_string` and `deserialize_db_from_string` methods in the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class, which are located in the `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` file. Additionally, the relevant sorting logic in `sort_dependencies` from `django/core/serializers/__init__.py` should be inspected. To address the issue, it's suggested to wrap the deserialization process in a transaction to prevent integrity errors, as currently done in the `loaddata` command in `django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py`. Given the detailed description and indications of where the problems lie, specifying these functions and classes should help find the exact points of modification.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is focused on the inconsistency in Django's TransactionTestCase rollbacks due to ordering constraints in the serialization and deserialization processes. The primary concern is that the `deserialize_db_from_string` method does not wrap the deserialization and saving of models in a transaction, which can lead to integrity errors when foreign key constraints are involved. This issue contrasts with the `loaddata` command, which uses a transaction to handle such situations, suggesting that this functionality was likely overlooked rather than intentionally omitted.\n\nUpon examining the provided search results, several code spans appear highly relevant to the issue at hand. Specifically, the `BaseDatabaseCreation.serialize_db_to_string` and `BaseDatabaseCreation.deserialize_db_from_string` methods in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` directly address the process of serializing and deserializing the database contents, which is central to the issue described. Additionally, the `sort_dependencies` function in `django/core/serializers/__init__.py`, which determines the order in which models are serialized, also plays a critical role in understanding the order of model serialization and its potential impact on the deserialization process.\n\nThe provided solution suggests wrapping the deserialization process within a transaction to ensure database integrity. This aligns directly with the identified issue and could be implemented by importing the `transaction` module and applying it within the `deserialize_db_from_string` method, as shown in the user's example diff.\n\nGiven these observations, it is clear that the code spans from `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` (specifically the `serialize_db_to_string` and `deserialize_db_from_string` methods) and the `sort_dependencies` function from `django/core/serializers/__init__.py` are highly relevant to the issue. Therefore, these spans should be identified as relevant for further inspection and potential modifications to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints\nDescription\n\t\nI hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n"
