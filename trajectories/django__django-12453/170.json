The primary problem lies in the `deserialize_db_from_string` method within the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class, which does not wrap the deserialization process in a transaction, leading to potential integrity issues. Key files and methods to inspect include `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` for `BaseDatabaseCreation.deserialize_db_from_string`, `django/core/serializers/__init__.py` for `sort_dependencies` which is used during serialization, and potentially `django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py` for comparison since `loaddata` correctly wraps its process in a transaction. The fix suggested involves adding a transaction wrapper around the deserialization process in `deserialize_db_from_string`.",

The issue specifically points out that `deserialize_db_from_string` does not wrap the deserialization process in a transaction, which can lead to integrity errors if foreign key constraints are violated. The suggested solution is to wrap the deserialization in a transaction to ensure all objects are saved correctly without violating foreign key constraints. The provided search results contain relevant code spans that directly address this issue:\n1. `BaseDatabaseCreation.deserialize_db_from_string` in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` - This method needs to be modified to include a transaction.\n2. `sort_dependencies` in `django/core/serializers/__init__.py` - This method is responsible for ordering models during serialization, which is indirectly related to the issue.\n3. The `Command.loaddata` method in `django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py` shows a similar operation wrapped in a transaction, supporting the suggested fix.\n\nThese code spans are directly relevant to the issue, and the suggestion to wrap `deserialize_db_from_string` in a transaction aligns with the pattern seen in `loaddata`.",

  "initial_message": "`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints\nDescription\n\t\nI hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n"
