The main point is that `BaseDatabaseCreation.deserialize_db_from_string` does not handle transactions, which can lead to integrity errors when objects with foreign keys are saved before their referenced objects. The suggested solution is to wrap the deserialization process in a transaction.\n\nIn the provided search results, several key code spans are relevant to the issue:\n1. `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` includes the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class with methods `serialize_db_to_string` and `deserialize_db_from_string`.\n2. The `deserialize_db_from_string` method currently deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction, which directly aligns with the identified issue.\n3. The `loaddata` method in `django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py` demonstrates how transactions should be handled by wrapping the loading process in a transaction, providing a relevant example of best practice.\n4. The `sort_dependencies` function in `django/core/serializers/__init__.py` is also relevant as it orders models during serialization. However, it doesn't handle foreign key orderings, which the reporter acknowledges as an inherent challenge.\n\nBased on these findings, the relevant code spans have been identified, focusing on those directly involved in serialization and deserialization processes within the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class, and showing where transactions should ideally be implemented to address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints\nDescription\n\t\nI hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n"
