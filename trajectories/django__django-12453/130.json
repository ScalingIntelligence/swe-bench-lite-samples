This occurs because the deserialization process does not wrap the saving of objects in a transaction, which can lead to integrity errors if objects with foreign keys are saved before their referenced objects. The suggested fix involves wrapping the deserialization process in a transaction. To identify the relevant code, we need to find specific functions and methods involved in the serialization and deserialization of database contents, as well as those responsible for managing transactions. We should focus on the files mentioned in the issue context, particularly those related to database creation, serialization, and transaction management.",

The user suggests using transactions to fix the problem and provides a diff suggesting adding `transaction.atomic` around the deserialization process. To identify relevant code spans, I looked at the provided `search_results` for functions related to serialization and deserialization and the handling of transactions. Specifically, `sort_dependencies` in the `django/core/serializers/__init__.py` file relates to ordering models during serialization, which is directly relevant to the issue. Additionally, the `transaction.py` file contains utility functions for handling transactions, which are relevant to the suggested fix. Based on the user's description, the key parts of the code are those that deal with serialization/deserialization and transaction management, as these are the areas that need to be modified according to the suggested fix. Therefore, the identified spans are 'sort_dependencies' from the serializers file and the transaction utility functions from the transactions file. These selections should cover the relevant aspects suggested by the user's description and the potential fix they propose.",

Specifically, when `serialized_rollback = True`, the `BaseDatabaseCreation.deserialize_db_from_string` method does not wrap the deserialization process in a transaction, which can lead to integrity errors. The suggested fix involves wrapping the deserialization process in a transaction to ensure all objects are saved correctly without violating foreign key constraints.\n\nTo address this, the analysis focused on the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class within the `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` file. The key method identified is `deserialize_db_from_string`, which is currently missing the transaction wrapping that is essential for handling the deserialization safely. This method needs to be modified to use Django's `transaction.atomic` context manager to ensure atomicity during deserialization.\n\nAdditionally, the analysis confirmed that the `sort_dependencies` function in `django/core/serializers/__init__.py` is responsible for sorting models during serialization. This function currently only handles natural keys and doesn't address foreign key constraints, which is a known limitation. However, improving this function to better handle foreign key dependencies is not within the scope of this issue but could be considered for future enhancements.\n\nThe identified code span in `BaseDatabaseCreation.deserialize_db_from_string` is relevant and aligns with the suggested fix from the reported issue. The existing implementation of this method does not ensure transactional integrity when saving deserialized objects, leading to potential integrity errors. The modification proposed in the reported issue, which involves wrapping this method's operations in a transaction, is necessary to resolve the issue effectively.\n\nThis focus on the specific code span in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` appears to be sufficient to address the reported issue since the primary concern is the lack of transactional handling in the deserialization process.",

  "initial_message": "`TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects due to ordering constraints\nDescription\n\t\nI hit this problem in a fairly complex projet and haven't had the time to write a minimal reproduction case. I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers \u200brollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n"
