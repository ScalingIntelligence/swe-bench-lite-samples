The current implementation of Field's equality comparison (__eq__), less-than comparison (__lt__), and hashing (__hash__) methods only consider the creation_counter, which leads to fields from different models comparing as equal. This behavior is not intuitive and can lead to unexpected results when dealing with sets or other collections that rely on object uniqueness based on their equality. To address this, the Field class's methods for equality (__eq__), hashing (__hash__), and order comparison (__lt__) need to be updated to also consider the model that the field belongs to so that fields from different models can be differentiated. The provided search results contain the relevant code spans for these methods in the Field class within django/db/models/fields/__init__.py.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
