The solution involves adjusting the `__eq__` method to consider the field's model, as well as adjusting `__hash__` and `__lt__` to match. The provided search results contain relevant code spans that define the `Field` class and its methods for equality (`__eq__`), less than (`__lt__`), and hashing (`__hash__`).

Currently, fields only consider `self.creation_counter` when comparing for equality. The issue proposes adjusting `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods to consider the field's model, ensuring fields from different models compare unequal. The analysis of the provided code spans shows that the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` already has `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods, but they only use `creation_counter`. Additionally, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` has its own `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods, but they are unrelated to the Field class's equality checks.\n\nGiven the issue, the relevant code spans are those in the `Field` class, specifically the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods. These methods need to be adjusted to include a check for the field's model. Implementing these changes in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` would address the reported issue.",

This is to ensure that fields from different models do not compare as equal, which can lead to issues such as de-duplication in sets. The current implementations of these methods in the Field class only consider the creation_counter, which is not sufficient to distinguish fields from different models. Therefore, the relevant code spans to address this issue are those defining or using these comparison methods in the Field class. The search results provide access to these methods and the class itself, which should be modified to include a check for field.model. Additionally, options.py contains the Options class which manages model fields and the base.py includes the Model class which interacts with fields and models, validating concern about references to other parts of the codebase not found in search results. Nonetheless, we could concentrate on the Field class and subclasses as we go.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
