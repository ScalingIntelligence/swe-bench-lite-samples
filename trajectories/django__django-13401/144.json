Specifically, the fields from different models (B and C) derived from the abstract model A are comparing equal due to the current implementation of the __eq__ method in the Field class, which only considers self.creation_counter. This behavior leads to unexpected deduplication when using sets. To address this, the solution involves adjusting the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods to account for the model in which the field is defined. The provided search results include the relevant parts of the Field class --- specifically, the __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods, which need to be modified to introduce this change. Additionally, the __init__ method is relevant as it initializes the creation_counter, which is currently the only factor in equality comparison. Therefore, the identified code spans are the ones containing the existing implementations of these comparison methods and the initialization of creation_counter.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
