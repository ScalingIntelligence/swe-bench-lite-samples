The current implementation only considers self.creation_counter when comparing fields for equality, leading to unexpected results when fields from different models that inherit from the same abstract model are compared. To address this, adjustments are needed in the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods of the Field class. The __eq__ method should incorporate the field's model to ensure fields from different models do not compare as equal. The __hash__ method should also be adjusted to match the new equality logic. For __lt__, it's suggested to order by self.creation_counter first to maintain existing orderings unaffected by this change. Relevant files to investigate are those defining the Field class and methods involved in the equality and comparison logic.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
