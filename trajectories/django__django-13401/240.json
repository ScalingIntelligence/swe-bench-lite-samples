The current behavior, where fields compare as equal solely based on `self.creation_counter`, leads to unexpected de-duplication. To fix this, the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods need to be adjusted so that fields from different models can be differentiated. The relevant files identified so far include those related to model fields, model base, migration state, manager, indexes, expressions, and constraints. We should focus on the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in these files to identify where adjustments are needed.",

The current implementation of `Field.__eq__` and `Field.__lt__` only considers `self.creation_counter` for comparison, which can lead to fields from different models being considered equal. This is clearly demonstrated in the provided `Field.__eq__` and `Field.__lt__` methods from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. To resolve this issue, adjustments to `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods are necessary to include field.model in the comparison. The inclusion of field.model in these methods would ensure that fields are only considered equal if they belong to the same model. Also, considering the discussion on IRC and the agreed-upon need for a non-intuitive behavior fix, adjusting `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` in the Field class would appropriately address the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
