Specifically, the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods in the Field class seem to be involved in this comparison. The current implementation of these methods only considers self.creation_counter, which does not distinguish between fields from different models. To address this, the __eq__ method should be adjusted to check if the field.model is different, and similar adjustments should be made to __hash__ and __lt__. The search should focus on the Field class in the corresponding Django model fields files.",

The goal is to modify `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and possibly `__lt__` to account for the model. Diving into the search results, several relevant spans are found across different files which relate to `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and comparison methods. These spans define how instances of various classes like `BaseExpression`, `Field`, `Model`, and others equate with each other, which is directly related to the issue at hand. Additionally, various class definitions such as `RegexValidator`, `EmailValidator`, and `ExclusionConstraint` have their own `__eq__` methods defined, hinting at the need for custom comparison logic in such contexts. Key sections include `Field.__eq__` and `Field.__hash__` in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, which is critically important to adjust for the reported issue, as it's the central point of comparison failure described.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
