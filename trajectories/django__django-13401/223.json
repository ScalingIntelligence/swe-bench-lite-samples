This leads to de-duplication problems when trying to operate on these fields as distinct entities. The solution involves adjusting the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods so that fields from different models are considered unequal if their `model` attributes differ. The provided files likely contain the relevant methods, so we should focus our search on these files. The primary goal is to locate the implementations of `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` within the Field class and other related classes to understand how the comparison logic can be adjusted.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
