Currently, fields from different models that inherit from an abstract base class are considered equal if their 'creation_counter' is the same. This leads to unexpected behavior when attempting to distinguish between fields of different models. The suggested solution involves modifying the '__eq__', '__hash__', and '__lt__' methods of the Field class to consider the 'model' attribute in addition to 'creation_counter'. This approach aims to ensure that fields from different models are not considered equal. The search results include the relevant code spans within the Field class, namely '__init__', '__eq__', '__lt__', and '__hash__'. These code spans are central to addressing the issue, as they describe the current mechanisms for comparison and hashing, which are in need of adjustment to match the proposed solution. Therefore, these pieces of code are directly relevant to the reported issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
