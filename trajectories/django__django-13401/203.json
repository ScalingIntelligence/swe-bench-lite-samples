The current implementation of __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ behaves unintuitively, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality. To address this, adjustments should be made to these methods to consider the field's model. Given the provided context, it seems relevant to focus on the Field class in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py and potentially related classes like Model in django/db/models/base.py.",

This is because currently, fields from different models can compare as equal. The provided search results include sections of code where the equality methods (__eq__, __lt__, and __hash__) are defined for the Field class in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py'. Additionally, the Model class in 'django/db/models/base.py' includes similar methods and could be relevant. Relevant spans include '__eq__' and '__hash__' methods from the Field class, as they currently only consider 'creation_counter' for equality and hashing. Adjusting these methods to include a check on the field's model would address the issue, ensuring fields from different models do not compare as equal and potentially causing issues in sets or other collections. It may also be beneficial to investigate and adjust the '__lt__' method to ensure consistent ordering. Thus, these sections are relevant to the reported issue, addressing the equality comparison and hashing of model fields.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
