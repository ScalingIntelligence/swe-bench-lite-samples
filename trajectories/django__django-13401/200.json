Currently, fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality, which can lead to unexpected behavior when pulling fields from different models into a shared set. To address this, the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods in the Field class need to be adjusted so that if the field.model is different, they will compare as unequal. The search results include relevant code spans from the Field class in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py, which defines the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods. Additionally, there are spans from django/db/models/base.py that define similar methods for the Model class, which could also be relevant but are less directly related to the specific issue of abstract model field comparison. The identified spans in the Field class are highly relevant to the issue as they currently define the equality and ordering of fields based on creation_counter, which needs to be adjusted to incorporate different models. Therefore, these spans should be examined and possibly modified to resolve the reported issue.",

This can lead to issues with fields across different models being considered equal, which is the core issue described in the reported issue. To fully address the issue, ensuring that fields from different models do not compare as equal, the methods need to be adjusted to factor in the model to which the field belongs. The initial steps towards this modification are apparent in the existing methods, where comparisons are currently solely based on `creation_counter`. However, given the nature of the issue, a more comprehensive adjustment involving the `model` attribute is necessary. Since the current file context does not include the model definitions or their interactions with fields, it is not possible to confirm that all relevant code necessary to resolve the issue is present. Further investigation into how fields are used within the models and across the Django codebase is advised.",

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
