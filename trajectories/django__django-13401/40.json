Specifically, it points out that fields from different models inheriting from an abstract model compare as equal due to how the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods are currently implemented in the `Field` class. To address this, the issue suggests adjusting these methods to consider the field's model, ensuring that fields from different models will not compare as equal. Given this, the relevant code spans in the provided search results are those that define the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods of the `Field` class. These methods are identified as critical areas that need modification based on the reported issue. By adjusting these methods, the goal is to fix the equality comparison issue according to the requirements detailed in the issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
