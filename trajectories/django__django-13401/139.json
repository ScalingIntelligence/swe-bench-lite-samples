To address this, modifications are required in the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods of the Field class to consider the model attribute. This will ensure that fields from different models compare as unequal, even if they share the same name and type. The changes should also maintain the current behavior for cases not affected by this equality collision, potentially by ordering primarily by creation_counter.",

These methods currently rely solely on the creation_counter for comparison, which aligns with the observed behavior described in the issue.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
