This difference should ensure that two Field objects from different models do not compare equal. This is crucial to ensure that abstract fields do not unintentionally overwrite each other when considering multiple models at once, and to preserve the order of sorting in cases where this equality collision might affect the sorting. The search results indicate that the Field class already has implementations of __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__. However, these methods do not currently take the model into account. Additionally, the Field class uses creation_counter for equality and sorting purposes, mirroring the problem described in the issue. Therefore, the solution involves modifying the Field class's __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods to include the model in their logic.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
