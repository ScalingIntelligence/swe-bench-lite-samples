The current comparison logic only considers self.creation_counter for equality, which leads to abstract fields being considered equal across different models. This needs to be changed so that fields compare unequal if their field.model is different. Additionally, __hash__ and __lt__ methods should be adjusted to align with this change. The __lt__ method should order fields first by self.creation_counter to avoid reordering in unaffected cases. Given the extensive involvement of model fields in Django, focusing on the Field class within django.db.models.fields and related methods is crucial for addressing this issue.",

The current implementation of Field's equality, less than, and hash methods only consider the creation_counter. This approach needs adjustment to include the model differences, as suggested. The search results contain the relevant sections of the Field class where these methods (__eq__, __lt__, and __hash__) are implemented.

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
