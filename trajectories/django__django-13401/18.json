The current implementation only considers `self.creation_counter`, which leads to unexpected behavior where fields from different models compare as equal. To resolve this, the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods should be adjusted to include the field's model in their comparison logic. Relevant files include those handling base models, fields, and their metadata. The primary focus should be on the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `ModelBase` and `Model` classes in `django/db/models/base.py`, and the `ModelState` class in `django/db/migrations/state.py`.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of abstract model fields being compared as equal across different models, which leads to unexpected de-duplication. The task is to adjust the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the `Field` class to account for the field's model, ensuring that fields from different models do not compare as equal. The search results presented include relevant sections of code from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, specifically the `Field` class and its methods such as `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__hash__`, and `__init__`. Additionally, there are references to the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py`, specifically the `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods, which might be indirectly affected by the changes needed in the `Field` class. The provided code spans show the current implementations of these methods, which solely rely on `creation_counter` for comparison and hashing. These sections perfectly align with the need to introduce considerations for the `field.model` to differentiate fields from different models. Adjustments to these methods as per the issue description will likely resolve the unexpected behavior involving abstract model fields. The identified code spans are precise targets for modifications that should cover the requirements of the reported issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
