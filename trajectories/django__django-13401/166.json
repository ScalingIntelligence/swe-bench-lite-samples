This can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with fields across different models derived from an abstract base. The solution involves adjusting the equality comparison (__eq__), hash calculation (__hash__), and possibly the less-than comparison (__lt__) so that fields from different models do not compare as equal. The relevant classes to look at are Field and its subclasses within the django.db.models.fields module, as well as any relevant classes in the django.db.models.base module where model-related operations take place. We should specify the search to look for the exact methods __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ in these specific modules to implement the necessary changes.",

This is done in the `__eq__` and `__lt__` methods of the `Field` class. To address the issue, the comparison logic in these methods should be adjusted to also consider the `field.model`. The search results include the relevant methods (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__`) in the `Field` class, as well as the class definition, which indicates that these methods are indeed the ones that need to be modified. Additionally, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` was also considered, but it primarily focuses on model instances rather than fields, so it is less relevant to the issue at hand.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
