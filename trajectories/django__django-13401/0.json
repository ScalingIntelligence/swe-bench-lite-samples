This is due to the comparison logic in the `Field` class, which only considers `self.creation_counter`. The solution aims to adjust `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in the `Field` class so that fields from different models compare as unequal. Several relevant files have been identified, including `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, where the `Field` class is defined, and other files like `django/db/models/base.py`, `django/db/models/manager.py`, etc., which also define methods related to comparison. Based on this, the search should focus on the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and the methods `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__`.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
