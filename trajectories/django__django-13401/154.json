Specifically, the issue highlights that fields from different models inheriting from the same abstract model compare as equal due to the current implementation of the `__eq__` method in the `Field` class. The solution proposed is to adjust the `__eq__` method to consider the `field.model` so that fields from different models will compare as unequal. Additionally, adjustments to `__hash__` and `__lt__` methods are mentioned to ensure consistency. The search results provide code spans from Django's `Field` class and other related classes, including the current implementation of `__eq__` in `Field`. This implementation only compares `creation_counter`, which is insufficient for the reported issue.\n\nTo address the issue, the relevant code spans are those from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` specifically the `Field.__eq__` span where the `__eq__` method is currently defined to compare only `creation_counter`. This span needs to be adjusted to incorporate the `model` attribute as well, which is missing from the provided code spans but is mentioned in the issue as necessary for a proper comparison. Additionally, examining the `__total_ordering`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods if they exist, would be beneficial to ensure all related methods are adjusted coherently.\n\nThe task is complete with the identification of the relevant `Field.__eq__` method that needs adjustment in the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file.",

In particular, the Field class contains the __eq__ method, which is crucial for evaluating the equality of fields. Given the detailed context provided, it appears that the relevant code to address the issue of fields in abstract models comparing as equal is at least partially present here. The specific method (__eq__) checks for equality based on the 'creation_counter' attribute, which is relevant to the issue described. To fully address the issue, one would likely also need to modify the __hash__ and __lt__ methods in a similar way to consider the 'model' attribute for fields from different models. However, based on the provided context, I do not see the implementation of these methods, but their correction aligns well with the described issue. Thus, we have identified the relevant code with respect to __eq__, but the full solution might require modifications to other methods as well, suggesting that the file context does not entirely cover the necessary modifications.",

The core of the problem lies in the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and potentially `__lt__` methods of the `Field` class in Django's ORM. Currently, these methods rely solely on `creation_counter` for equality and hashing, which can lead to unexpected de-duplication when fields from different models are compared. Thus, modifications to these methods are required to include the `model` attribute in the comparison logic to prevent fields from different models comparing equally. To identify relevant code spans, I searched for implementations of `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` within the `Field` class and other related classes in the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and `django/db/models/expressions.py` files. The identified spans include the existing `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods in the `Field` class and `Model` class, which need to be adjusted to incorporate additional comparison criteria such as the `model` attribute. Additionally, considering the potential need to adjust the `__lt__` method, I focused on identifying relevant method definitions in the search results.",

The solution proposed is to adjust `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods to consider the `field.model`, which would make fields from different models compare as unequal. The search results include relevant sections from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and `django/db/models/expressions.py`. The `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` is particularly relevant as it contains the methods `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__init__` that need to be adjusted. The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` and the `BaseExpression` and `F` classes in `django/db/models/expressions.py` also contain `__hash__` methods that might need consideration but are not directly related to the issue of field equality.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
