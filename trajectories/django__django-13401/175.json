The solution involves adjusting the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods in the Field class to consider the field.model, ensuring they compare unequal when they belong to different models. The files provided and the issue description suggest that the relevant code lies in the Field class, which can be found in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py.

Specifically, the issue arises because the equality (`__eq__`), less than (`__lt__`), and hash (`__hash__`) methods of the `Field` class currently only consider `self.creation_counter` for these operations. This leads to abstract model fields being considered equal across different models, which is not the intended behavior. The solution proposed is to adjust these methods to include the `field.model` in the comparison when determining equality, hash, and order. Given this understanding, the relevant code spans are the methods `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` in the `Field` class. These methods need to be modified to include the `field.model` in their calculations to resolve the reported issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
