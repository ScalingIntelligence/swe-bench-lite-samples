The current implementation of the `Field` class in Django uses `creation_counter` for equality comparison, which leads to abstract fields comparing as equal across different models. This can cause unexpected behavior, such as de-duplication in sets. The solution suggested by the report involves modifying the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods to take into account the model (self.model) to which the field belongs, ensuring that fields from different models do not compare as equal. The search results provided include the relevant sections of the `Field` class where these methods (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__hash__`) are defined. This code is directly related to the issue because it outlines the current comparison logic that needs to be adjusted.",

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
