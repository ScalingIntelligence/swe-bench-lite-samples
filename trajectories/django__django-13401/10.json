The issue specifically mentions that the current implementation of `__eq__` and `__hash__` in the `Field` class only considers `self.creation_counter`, which causes fields from different models to compare as equal. This can lead to unexpected behavior when these fields are used in sets or other collections.\n\nTo address this, the relevant code spans to be adjusted are:\n1. The `__eq__` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, which currently checks equality based solely on `creation_counter`.\n2. The `__hash__` method in the same file, which also uses `creation_counter` for hashing.\n3. The `__lt__` method, which should be adjusted to consider `model` as well, ensuring that fields from different models are ordered correctly.\n\nThe adjustments needed are to include a comparison of `self.model` in the `__eq__` method and to adjust `__hash__` and `__lt__` accordingly to accommodate this change. This will ensure that fields from different models do not compare as equal and can be uniquely identified in collections.\n\nGiven the search results, the relevant code spans are clearly identified in the `Field` class within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` is not directly relevant to this specific issue, as the focus is on the behavior of the `Field` class in the context of abstract models.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
