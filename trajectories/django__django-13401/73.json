This could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to distinguish between fields of different models that are subclasses of the same abstract model. The relevant code spans to address this issue are related to the equality and comparison methods of the Field class, specifically __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__. By modifying these methods to consider additional properties such as the model to which the field belongs, the proposed solution can be implemented. The current implementations of these methods solely rely on the creation_counter, which does not distinguish between fields of different models but the same class. Therefore, these sections of the code need to be updated to ensure that fields are not considered equal or ordered improperly when they belong to different models.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
