Specifically, fields in models B and C (both inheriting from abstract model A) are considered equal due to the current implementation of `__eq__` and `__hash__` in the `Field` class, which only considers `creation_counter`. This leads to unexpected behavior when attempting to check for the uniqueness of these fields. The suggested solution is to modify `__eq__` to consider the `model` attribute, which would ensure that fields from different models are not equal. Similarly, `__hash__` and `__lt__` should be adjusted to maintain the integrity of the object comparison. The search results provide relevant code spans in two files: `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model` class's `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods are found, which manage equality for model instances based on primary key comparison, but do not directly address the field-level equality issue. In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `Field` class's `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods are found, which are directly responsible for managing equality at the field level. The proposed change would need to be implemented in these methods in the `Field` class to fix the issue described. No relevant code spans were found in `django/db/models/manager.py` for this specific issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
