This behavior is determined by the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods in the Field class of Django's model fields. Given the focus on these specific methods, the search should concentrate on the Field class in the django/db/models/fields/__init__.py file. Additionally, it's important to verify and potentially adjust the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods in other relevant classes such as Model, ModelState, BaseManager, Index, BaseExpression, and UniqueConstraint to ensure consistent behavior across different models.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
