Specifically, it highlights that two instances of the same field from different models are considered equal due to the current implementation of the `__eq__` method, which only checks the `creation_counter`. This behavior leads to unexpected deduplication in sets and needs to be adjusted. The solution proposed involves modifying the `__eq__` method to consider the field's model so that fields from different models do not compare as equal. Additionally, modifications to `__hash__` and `__lt__` methods are suggested to maintain consistency. The search results provided include sections of Django's `Field` class from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `Model` class from `django/db/models/base.py`, which are highly relevant to the reported issue as they contain the current implementations of `__eq__`, `__init__`, and other methods related to field and model operations. These sections of code are directly related to the functionality that needs to be adjusted to resolve the issue. Thus, the search results are relevant and provide a good starting point for identifying the code spans that need modification.",

In the provided file context, the relevant methods `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` in the `Field` class of `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` only consider `self.creation_counter` for comparison, which aligns with the issue. Additionally, the `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` also implements these methods but does not factor in the model type for comparison, which could be relevant depending on how `Field` instances are utilized within `Model` instances.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
