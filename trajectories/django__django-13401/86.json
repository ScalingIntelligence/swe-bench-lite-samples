The current implementation in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py is focused solely on comparing the `creation_counter` for equality, which results in fields from different models being considered equal if they share the same `creation_counter`. This is not intuitive and leads to unexpected behavior when trying to compare or differentiate fields from different models. To address this, the code must be adjusted to consider the `model` when comparing fields. This adjustment should primarily occur in the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the Field class. Additionally, the `__eq__` method for UniqueConstraint should also be reviewed in django/db/models/constraints.py, although this specific class is not directly related to the abstract model equality issue. The file django/db/models/base.py contains equality and hash methods for the Model class, but these deal with model instances, not fields, so they are not directly relevant to the current issue. The identified relevant code spans contain the current implementations of the required methods and would be the starting point for implementing the required changes to ensure that fields from different models are treated as unequal in comparisons.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
