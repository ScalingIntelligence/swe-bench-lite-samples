The current implementation of the `Field` class's `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods only consider the `creation_counter` attribute, which leads to fields across different models being considered equal. This is unexpected and can lead to problems when attempting to create a shared set of fields.\n\nThe search results provided include the `Field` class definition and its comparison methods. The `__eq__` method currently compares fields based solely on their `creation_counter`, which is the root cause of the issue described. Similar logic is used in `__lt__` and `__hash__`. Modifying these methods to also consider the `model` attribute when comparing fields would address the problem.\n\nThe identified code spans are relevant as they directly pertain to the methods that need to be adjusted to resolve the equality comparison issue. The `Field` class's `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods need to be updated to include a check for the `model` attribute, ensuring that fields from different models are not considered equal. This would align with the proposed solution in the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
