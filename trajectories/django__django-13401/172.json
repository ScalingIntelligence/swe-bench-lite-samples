            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the equality comparison of abstract model fields. Specifically, it points out that fields from different models derived from an abstract base model are considered equal because they only consider `self.creation_counter` when comparing for equality. This behavior is unintuitive and can lead to unexpected results. The solution involves adjusting the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in the `Field` class to take into account the `field.model` when comparing fields from different models. This approach ensures that fields from different models are considered unequal, even if they share the same attributes. The analysis of the provided search results shows that there are relevant code spans within the `Field` class definition in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. These spans include `Field.__eq__`, `Field.__lt__`, and `Field.__hash__`. These methods currently only consider `self.creation_counter` which aligns with the problem described in the issue. Identifying these code spans is crucial for understanding the current implementation and planning the necessary changes. Thus, the relevant code spans have been identified in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, including the `Field.__eq__`, `Field.__lt__`, and `Field.__hash__` methods. These are the areas that need adjustment to resolve the reported issue. No other relevant code spans were found in the other files provided in the search results, indicating that the solution primarily involves modifying the `Field` class.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
