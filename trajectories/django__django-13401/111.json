The current equality comparison is based solely on the `creation_counter`, which can lead to unexpected results when fields in different models are compared. The proposed solution is to adjust the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods so that if the `field.model` is different, they will compare unequal. Furthermore, it suggests adjusting the comparison order to consider `self.creation_counter` first for cases not affected by this equality collision. To address this issue, we need to identify and update the relevant methods in the Field class. The search results provide the necessary context and code spans where these methods are defined in the Field class within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. These spans include `Field.__eq__`, `Field.__lt__`, and `Field.__hash__`, which are directly related to the problem described. Thus, these spans should be modified to incorporate the model difference into the comparison logic.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
