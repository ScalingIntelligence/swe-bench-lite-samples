            "scratch_pad": "The issue pertains to the comparison behavior of fields in Django models, particularly when those fields are part of abstract models. The core problem is that fields from different models (even if they inherit from an abstract model) are currently considered equal if they have the same creation_counter, which leads to unexpected de-duplication and equality in sets. To address this, adjustments are needed in the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods of the Field class. The files provided likely contain the methods that need adjustment. Since the Field class is defined in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py and other relevant comparison methods are spread across multiple files, it would be efficient to focus on these specific files for the search.",

The current implementation of the Field class's __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods only consider self.creation_counter, which leads to the issue of fields from different models comparing as equal. To address this, the report suggests modifying these methods to consider the field's model as well. The search results provided include relevant code spans from the Field class in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', which defines the __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods, making them good candidates for modification. Additionally, the Model class in 'django/db/models/base.py' includes similar comparison methods that might also need adjustments if the issue is to be fully resolved. Other files like 'django/db/migrations/state.py', 'django/db/models/manager.py', 'django/db/models/indexes.py', and 'django/db/models/constraints.py' also contain class definitions with comparison methods, but these are less directly related to the issue at hand compared to the Field and Model classes.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
