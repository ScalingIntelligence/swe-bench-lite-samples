The current implementation of `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` in the `Field` class relies solely on `creation_counter`, which can cause fields from different models to compare as equal when they shouldn't. This analysis reveals that the relevant code spans are where these methods are defined in the `Field` class, as these are the methods that need to be adjusted to consider the `model` attribute. Additionally, adjusting `__lt__` and `__hash__` methods to match the adjusted `__eq__` will ensure consistent behavior across the class. The search results provide direct access to these critical methods, making it clear which parts of the codebase require modification to resolve the issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
