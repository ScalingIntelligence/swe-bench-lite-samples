This leads to unexpected behavior where fields from different models are considered equal. To resolve this, the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods should be adjusted to include the `field.model` in their calculations. This will ensure fields from different models do not compare as equal. Given the file context provided, the relevant files are `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` for the `Field` class methods, and potentially other files where model fields are managed or compared.",

This issue suggests modifying the Field's __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods to consider the model instance in addition to the creation counter. The initial context provided relevant segments of the Field class from django/db/models/fields/__init__.py, such as the current implementations of __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__. Resuming from the current file context, the new search results continue to provide additional relevant spans within the Field class, including methods related to cloning and deep copying, and additional methods within the Model class. These results seem to reinforce the need for adjustments to the comparison and hashing methods in Field to accommodate the unique model instances.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
