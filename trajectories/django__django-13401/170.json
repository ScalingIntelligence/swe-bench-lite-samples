The current implementation uses `creation_counter` for comparison, which leads to fields across different models being considered equal. This can cause unintended behavior, such as fields being de-duplicated when they should not be.\n\nThe search results from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` contain the relevant code spans that define the `Field` class and its methods for equality (`__eq__`), comparison (`__lt__`), and hashing (`__hash__`). These methods currently rely solely on `creation_counter` for their operations, which aligns with the behavior described in the issue. Adjusting these methods to consider the `model` attribute in addition to `creation_counter` could resolve the problem. Therefore, the identified code spans are relevant and sufficient to address the issue.\n\nAdditional considerations include ensuring that any changes to these methods do not disrupt other functionalities that rely on the current ordering or hashing mechanisms.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
