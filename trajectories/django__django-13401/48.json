The current implementation of the Field class in Django compares fields only by their `creation_counter`, which can lead to unexpected equality between fields from different models that inherit from the same abstract model. This can cause issues when attempting to collect distinct fields from such models. To address this, the solution requires modifications to the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the Field class. These modifications should include consideration of the field's model to ensure that fields from different models do not compare as equal. The provided search results include the relevant methods (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__`) within the Field class. These methods currently rely solely on `creation_counter`, which aligns with the issue description.

This issue is evident in the provided context where the __eq__ method checks if the creation_counter of the field is equal to that of another field. This behavior is not intuitive and can lead to unexpected results when working with abstract models. The search results confirm the presence of the __eq__ method in the Field class, along with the __lt__ and __hash__ methods, supporting the need to adjust these methods to consider the model when comparing fields. The proposed solution involves modifying the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods to consider the model of the field, which would resolve the issue.

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
