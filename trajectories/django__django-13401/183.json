The current implementation of `Field`'s `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods only consider `creation_counter` for comparison. This behaviour is surprising and leads to unwanted deduplication. To address this, we need to adjust the equality comparison to include the model of the field. The search results include relevant code spans in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, particularly in the `Field` class for `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods. These methods currently only check against `creation_counter`, which aligns with the issue's root cause as reported. We should adjust these methods to also compare the `field.model` as suggested. This involves detailed alterations on how equality and hash values are determined. Knowing where to adjust in the codebase will aid in efficiently implementing a fix. The identified spans provide a good starting point for making the necessary changes. However, the entire section should be reviewed to understand the impact and to ensure that other parts of the code related to model fields are not affected. In summary, the search results help in pinpointing the exact locations where modifications are required to resolve the issue significantly.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
