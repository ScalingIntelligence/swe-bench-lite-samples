This leads to unexpected behavior, such as field deduplication. To address this, the solution proposed involves modifying the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods of the Field class to consider the field's model.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, we find relevant sections in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' that define the Field class and its methods: __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__. These methods currently rely solely on the 'creation_counter' for comparisons, which leads to the issue described. Therefore, these sections need to be modified to include a check for the 'field.model', ensuring that fields from different models are not considered equal.\n\nNo additional relevant sections were found in the 'django/db/models/base.py' search results that pertain directly to the issue at hand.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the identified code spans are relevant and focus on the specific parts of the codebase that require modification to resolve the reported issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
