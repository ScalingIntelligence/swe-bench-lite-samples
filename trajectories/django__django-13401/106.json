This leads to deduplication issues when fields are pulled into a shared set. The relevant parts of the code to address this are the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods in the `Field` class. These methods currently only take into account the `creation_counter`, which needs to be adjusted to also consider the `model` the field belongs to. By updating these methods to include the `model` in the comparison, the issue of abstract fields being considered equal across different models can be resolved. Additionally, it's important to ensure that other instances unaffected by this collision are not re-ordered, which implies maintaining the `creation_counter` as the primary order criterion when it's unambiguous. The search results include the necessary methods (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__`) and their current implementations, which are directly relevant to the issue at hand.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
