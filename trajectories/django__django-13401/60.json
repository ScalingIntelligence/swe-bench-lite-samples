The current implementation of `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` in the `Field` class does not account for the differences in the field's model, leading to unintended equality between fields of different models. To resolve this, the comparison methods should be adjusted to consider the field's model, ensuring that fields from different models do not compare as equal. Relevant files include those where `Field` and related classes are defined, focusing on `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods.",

The current implementation of `Field.__eq__` and `Field.__lt__` only considers `self.creation_counter`, which can lead to fields from different models being considered equal. This is problematic when dealing with abstract models because fields from different concrete models that inherit from the same abstract model should not compare as equal. To address this, the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods need to be adjusted to include `field.model` in the comparison. The provided search results include the relevant methods (`Field.__eq__`, `Field.__lt__`, `Field.__hash__`) in the `Field` class. These methods are the ones that need to be modified to ensure fields from different models do not compare as equal. Additionally, the `Field.__init__` method is relevant as it initializes the `creation_counter`, which is used in the current comparison methods.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
