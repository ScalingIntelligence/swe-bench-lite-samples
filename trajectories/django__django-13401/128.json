The current implementation only considers the creation_counter, which leads to incorrect comparison results when fields are inherited from an abstract model across different child models. The provided search results include the relevant portions of the Field class with their current implementations of __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__. These methods need to be adjusted to meet the requirements specified in the issue. Specifically, __eq__ should include a check on the model, ensuring that fields from different models are not considered equal. Similarly, __hash__ and __lt__ should also adapt to consider the model difference. These modifications will ensure that fields from different models are uniquely identifiable and comparable, resolving the issue of de-duplication in sets.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
