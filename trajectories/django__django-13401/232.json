The current implementation uses 'creation_counter' for equality, which leads to issues when fields from different models are compared. The task involves adjusting the '__eq__' method, and possibly '__hash__' and '__lt__' methods, to take into account the model of the field. The provided search results include several Django model classes such as 'Field', 'ModelState', 'UniqueConstraint', 'BaseExpression', and 'Index', each with their own '__eq__' implementation. The 'Field' class is of particular interest as it directly relates to the field comparison issue described. The '__eq__' method in 'Field' currently only compares 'creation_counter', and this could be adjusted to also consider the model, similar to the proposal in the issue. The search results do not directly address the proposed changes but provide a basis for understanding Django's existing field comparison logic which can guide the implementation of the changes.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
