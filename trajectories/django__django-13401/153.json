The current implementation of `Field.__eq__`, `Field.__lt__`, and `Field.__hash__` in Django's `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` only considers the `creation_counter` for comparison, which is why fields from different models (class B and class C extending from an abstract base class A) compare as equal. This is confirmed by the provided code spans for `Field.__eq__`, `Field.__lt__`, and `Field.__hash__`. To resolve this issue, the `__eq__` method should be adjusted to consider `field.model` and potentially other attributes to ensure that fields from different models are not equal. Similarly, `__hash__` and `__lt__` should be adjusted accordingly to maintain consistency. The provided code spans are directly relevant to addressing the issue, as they define the methods responsible for the equality, ordering, and hashing of fields in Django's ORM.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
