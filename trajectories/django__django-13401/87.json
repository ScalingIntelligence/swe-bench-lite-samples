The fields are currently considered equal due to only considering self.creation_counter in the comparison. The suggested solution is to adjust __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods to consider the field.model in the comparison to ensure fields from different models are not equal. 2. Review Current Context: The current file context shows the Field class in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py which contains the current implementations of __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__. These methods only consider self.creation_counter which is the root of the issue. 3. Process New Search Results: After analyzing the new search results, the relevant code spans are found in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py (spans for Field.__eq__, Field.__lt__, and Field.__hash__). The issue suggests adjusting these methods to include self.model in the comparison logic to ensure fields from different models compare as unequal. The search results also include other files like django/contrib/admin/options.py, django/contrib/admin/utils.py, etc., but these do not directly address the reported issue related to field comparison in models.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
