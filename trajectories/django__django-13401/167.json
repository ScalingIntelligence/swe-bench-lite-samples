The provided search results contain the 'Field' class and the 'Model' class, both of which need adjustments to their comparison methods. The 'Field' class's '__eq__', '__lt__', and '__hash__' methods currently only use 'creation_counter' for comparison, and modifications need to be made to incorporate the 'field.model'. Similarly, adjustments should also be made to the '__eq__' and '__hash__' methods in the 'Model' class, though the specific requirements there might differ due to the nature (e.g., abstract class in the reported issue) as discussed in the issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
