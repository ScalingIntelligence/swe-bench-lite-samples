Specifically, fields from different models that inherit from the same abstract model are currently considered equal based on their creation_counter, which leads to unexpected deduplication. The issue suggests adjusting the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods of the Field class to consider the field's model, preserving order by creation_counter for unaffected cases. This will ensure that fields from different models are not considered equal, which aligns with intuitive behavior. The Django source files provided indicate that the Field class and related model classes need to be inspected for methods related to equality and ordering.",

The current implementation of the '__eq__', '__lt__', and '__hash__' methods in the 'Field' class only considers the 'creation_counter' for comparison. This results in fields from different models being considered equal, which is not the desired behavior. The solution involves adjusting these methods to take the model into account for comparison. The provided search results include the relevant code spans where these methods are defined. The '__eq__' method needs to be updated to compare fields by their model as well as their 'creation_counter'. Similarly, '__hash__' should be adjusted to incorporate the model in the hash calculation. For '__lt__', ordering by 'creation_counter' first ensures that existing order is maintained, but also considering the model will be necessary to avoid unexpected ordering due to equality collisions.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
