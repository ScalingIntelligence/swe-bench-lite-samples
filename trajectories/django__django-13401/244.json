This problem stems from the equality comparison (__eq__) of the Field class, which only considers self.creation_counter. To resolve this, modifications are needed in the __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods of the Field class to incorporate comparisons based on the field's model. The aim is to make fields from different models compare as unequal. Since the problem is within the Field class's equality methods and potentially affecting order and hash methods, these specific areas in django/db/models/fields/__init__.py need to be investigated and adjusted accordingly. Additionally, adjustments might be needed in related methods in other parts of Django's ORM that rely on these comparisons.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
