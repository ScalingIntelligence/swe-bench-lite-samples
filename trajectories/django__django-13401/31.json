The issue arises because the current equality comparison (__eq__) and other related methods (__lt__ and __hash__) solely rely on the `creation_counter` attribute, leading to fields from different models being considered equal. This is unexpected and undesired behavior in cases where the fields have the same `creation_counter` but are from different models. The solution proposed involves modifying the equality comparison to consider the `model` attribute, ensuring that fields from different models are not considered equal. The search results provided include the relevant sections of code in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, where the `Field` class and its methods like `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` are defined. These methods currently only use `creation_counter` for comparisons, which directly relate to the issue described. Therefore, the identified spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
