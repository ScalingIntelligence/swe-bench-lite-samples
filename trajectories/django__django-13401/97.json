This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to distinguish between fields from different models. The solution involves adjusting the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods in the Field class to take into account the field's model, ensuring that fields from different models compare as unequal. Given the file context provided, the focus should be on the Field class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and potentially other files where these methods are defined.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue pertains to the equality comparison of fields in abstract models. Specifically, the current implementation of the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods in the `Field` class only considers `creation_counter` for comparison, which can lead to fields from different models being treated as equal. This is problematic because it can result in unexpected behavior when dealing with sets of fields from multiple models derived from the same abstract base model. \n\nUpon analyzing the search results, it is evident that the relevant code spans are those that define the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods. These methods are crucial because they directly affect how field objects are compared and sorted. The current implementation uses `creation_counter` for these comparisons, which is likely the root cause of the issue described. \n\nTo address the issue, it would be necessary to adjust the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods to consider the `model` attribute of the field, ensuring that fields from different models are not considered equal. Modifying these methods to handle this case would likely involve adding additional checks that take into account not only `creation_counter` but also the `model` attribute. However, this modification should be made with caution, potentially first ordering by `creation_counter` to avoid re-ordering cases that aren't affected by this equality collision. This approach would align with the suggestion made in the issue report, where it was noted that ordering by model first caused a test to break in an experimental branch.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
