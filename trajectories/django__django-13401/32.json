It specifically mentions that current comparison logic only considers self.creation_counter, which does not account for the model the field belongs to. This leads to unexpected behavior where fields from different models are considered equal. The solution proposed is to adjust the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods in the Field class to include model-specific information in the comparison. The search results include Django's Field class with methods for equality (__eq__), less than (__lt__), and hashing (__hash__). These methods are found in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. However, the current implementation only uses self.creation_counter for comparison, which aligns with the issue described. Thus, the relevant code spans to address the issue are those defining the __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods. Since no other files or methods are mentioned in the reported issue, these spans are comprehensive and sufficient for modifying the behavior for equality comparison across models.",

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
