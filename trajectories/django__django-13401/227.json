This adjustment is crucial to avoid de-duplication issues.

The current implementation of the Field class only considers the creation_counter attribute when comparing fields for equality, which leads to fields from different models being considered equal. This behaviour is not intuitive and can lead to unexpected results. The solution proposed involves adjusting the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods so that fields from different models are treated as unequal. The __lt__ method should also account for existing orderings to avoid breaking existing behaviours. The search results include the Field class definition, which contains the relevant methods (__eq__, __lt__, and __hash__) that need to be adjusted to include a comparison based on the model attribute. These methods currently only consider the creation_counter, which is why fields from different models are being 'de-duplicated'.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
