Fields from different models that inherit from the same abstract model are currently considered equal because they only consider `self.creation_counter` when comparing for equality. This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to create a set of these fields, as one gets de-duplicated. To resolve this, the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the `Field` class should be adjusted to consider the field's model, ensuring fields from different models do not compare as equal. Since the `Field` class and its methods are defined in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, that file is likely where the adjustment should be made.",

This leads to the issue where the fields from different models compare as equal. To address this, the __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods should be adjusted to consider the model in addition to creation_counter. Specifically, if the field.model is different, they should compare as unequal. This context is crucial for accurately addressing the issue.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
