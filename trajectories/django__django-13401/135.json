The current comparison logic in the Field class only considers self.creation_counter. This leads to fields from different but abstractly related models being considered equal, which is not intuitive and can lead to unexpected behavior. To address this, the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods in the Field class should be adjusted to consider the field's model in addition to self.creation_counter for proper differentiation. Relevant files to inspect are those dealing with model fields, model base classes, and migration state, particularly focusing on the field comparison logic.",

These sections are crucial for the modification needed to address the issue. Modifying these methods to consider the field's model when comparing for equality will solve the problem. Additionally, adjusting __hash__ and __lt__ methods to align with the new equality logic is also important. The search results also include Model and ModelState classes, but they do not directly affect the comparison of fields across models inherited from an abstract base model, which is the core issue here. Thus, the identified spans focus on the Field class and its comparison methods.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
