The key part of the issue is that '__eq__', '__lt__', and '__hash__' only consider 'self.creation_counter', which leads to fields comparing equal even if they belong to different models. To address this, the '__eq__', '__lt__', and '__hash__' methods need to consider the 'model' attribute, ensuring that fields from different models don't compare equal. The search results include the 'Field' class and its methods ('__init__', '__eq__', '__lt__', and '__hash__'), which are directly relevant to this issue. These methods are responsible for defining how fields are compared and ordered. Identifying and modifying these methods will help solve the reported issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
