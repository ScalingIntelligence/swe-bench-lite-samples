Specifically, fields from different child models of an abstract base class are currently considered equal due to their comparison solely relying on `self.creation_counter`. This can lead to unexpected behavior when pulling fields into a shared set. To address this, modifications should be made to the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods to consider the field's model, ensuring that fields from different models are not considered equal. A search should be conducted within the `fields` and `base` directories of the Django project to locate the relevant `Field` and `Model` classes which need to be adjusted.",

Specifically, it highlights that two field objects from different models (B and C) are considered equal due to their `creation_counter` being the same. According to the user, this behavior is unexpected and can lead to unintended consequences. The user suggests that fields should compare unequal if their `model` attributes are different, and also suggests adjustments to `__hash__` and `__lt__` methods to align with this change.\n\nI analyzed the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file, which contains the `Field` class definition. The key parts of this file that relate to the reported issue are the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods within the `Field` class. These methods currently rely solely on `creation_counter` for equality comparison, ordering, and hashing, respectively, which aligns with the current problematic behavior.\n\nGiven the user's suggestion, we need to adjust these methods to include a check for `model` attributes. This adjustment will help ensure that fields from different models are not considered equal, thus preventing the unintended de-duplication.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those defining the equality, hashing, and ordering behavior of the `Field` class, because these are the methods needing adjustment to address the reported issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
