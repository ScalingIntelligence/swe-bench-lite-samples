Specifically, fields from different models inheriting from the same abstract base class are considered equal, which can lead to unexpected behavior like field de-duplication in sets. This issue is rooted in the `__eq__` method of the `Field` class, which only considers `creation_counter` for comparison. To resolve this, adjustments should be made to `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods to account for the difference in `field.model`. This can be explored in the `Field` class and related methods within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. Additionally, I should focus on identifying where these comparison methods are defined and implemented to ensure they account for the model's context when comparing fields.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
