The current implementation compares fields only by their creation counter, which leads to unexpected behavior when two fields from different models (which inherit from the same abstract model) are compared. To address this, the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods should be adjusted to consider the field's model, ensuring that fields from different models do not compare as equal. Relevant files to search in include those in the `django/db/models` directory, particularly those related to fields, base models, and model options.",

This requires adjustments to the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the field classes to consider the model they belong to. The search results provide several relevant code spans: 1. In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `Field` class has `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods that currently only consider `creation_counter`. 2. In `django/db/models/base.py`, the `Model` class has an `__eq__` method that does consider the model for comparison. 3. In `django/db/models/constraints.py`, the `UniqueConstraint` class also has an `__eq__` method. These methods will need to be adjusted to include the model in their comparison logic. Additionally, other parts of the codebase such as `Index` in `django/db/models/indexes.py` and `BaseExpression` in `django/db/models/expressions.py` may also need similar adjustments if they involve field comparisons. Given the complexity and interconnectedness of these components, it's crucial to review and adjust these methods in a comprehensive manner to ensure consistency and correctness across the ORM.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
