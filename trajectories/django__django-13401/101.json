The current implementation of the __eq__ method in Django's Field class only considers self.creation_counter, leading to fields in different models being considered equal. This needs to be adjusted to include the model in the comparison. Additionally, __hash__ and __lt__ methods should be updated to maintain consistency. The initial focus should be on the Field class in the django/db/models/fields/__init__.py file, particularly the __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods. Additional checks should be made on the Model class to ensure consistency across model instances as well.",

The current implementation of field comparison in Django's `Field` class only considers `self.creation_counter`, leading to unexpected equality results when comparing fields from different models that inherit from an abstract base class. The user requests adjustments to `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods to consider `field.model` for comparison. The search results include several files from Django's model and field implementations, notably `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`, which contain the `Field` and `Model` classes respectively. These files include the `__eq__` methods that need to be adjusted to incorporate model comparison. The `Field` class's `__eq__` method currently compares only by `creation_counter`, and the `Model` class's `__eq__` method does not directly address this issue.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
