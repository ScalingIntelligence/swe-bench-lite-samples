The current implementation relies solely on `self.creation_counter` for equality, which can lead to problematic behavior when comparing fields from different models that inherit from the same abstract base. To address this, adjustments to `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods are suggested to consider the field's model. This change is intended to make the behavior more intuitive and prevent unexpected de-duplication when dealing with sets of fields from different models.",

This will ensure that fields from different models compare as unequal even if they inherit from the same abstract model.\n\nLooking at the search results, the relevant code spans are located in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/models/base.py`. These files contain the `Field` class and the `Model` class, respectively. The `Field` class has the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods that need to be adjusted. The `Model` class also has `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods that might be relevant but are not directly the focus of this issue.\n\nThe existing `__eq__` and `__lt__` methods in the `Field` class only consider the `creation_counter` for comparison. The suggestion is to add the `field.model` to these comparisons to differentiate fields from different models.\n\nThe search results also include other files with classes like `ModelState`, `BaseManager`, `Index`, and `UniqueConstraint`, but these are not directly relevant to the issue of comparing fields across models.\n\nTo address the issue, the following changes should be made:\n1. Update the `__eq__` method in the `Field` class to include a check for `field.model`.\n2. Update the `__hash__` method to include `field.model`.\n3. Update the `__lt__` method to include `field.model`, potentially ordering first by `creation_counter` for cases not affected by this equality collision, then by `field.model`.\n\nGiven the extensive analysis of the codebase and the requirement to see entire sections to determine relevance, the identified code spans are sufficient to implement the necessary changes.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
