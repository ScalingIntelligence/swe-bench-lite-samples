The current comparison logic based solely on `creation_counter` results in fields across different models being considered equal, leading to unexpected behavior such as de-duplication. To address this, modifications to the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in the `Field` class are needed to account for the model context in which they exist. This will ensure fields from different models are treated as distinct, thus preventing unintended de-duplication. Given the context provided in the model files, focusing on methods related to field comparison in the `Field` class and possibly other related classes like `Model` and `ModelBase` is advisable.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
