The current implementation of the Field class's equality, less than, and hash methods relies solely on the creation_counter attribute, which leads to the observed behavior where fields from different models compare as equal. The solution suggested is to modify these methods to consider the field's model, ensuring that fields from different models will not compare as equal. The search results provided contain the relevant sections of the Field class, specifically the __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods, which are the focus for modifications to address the issue.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
