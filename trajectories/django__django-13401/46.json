The issue states that fields in different models are considered equal due to the equality comparison relying only on the `creation_counter`. This behavior is problematic as it leads to unexpected de-duplication of fields when using sets. The solution suggested is to adjust the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in the Field class to take into account the `field.model` in addition to the `creation_counter`. This will ensure fields from different models are compared as unequal. The provided search results contain the relevant parts of the Field class definition in Django's models: `__init__`, `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods. These sections are crucial for implementing the suggested changes to resolve the issue.",

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
