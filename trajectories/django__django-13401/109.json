Specifically, the issue is that fields from different models that inherit from the same abstract model are currently considered equal because their comparison is based solely on the 'creation_counter'. This leads to unexpected behavior when attempting to differentiate between fields from different models.\n\nThe search results contain the relevant code spans that define the 'Field' class and its comparison methods ('__eq__', '__lt__', and '__hash__'). These methods are key to addressing the reported issue, as they need to be adjusted to consider the model when comparing fields.\n\n- 'Field' class definition: This is the base class for all field types in Django models. Adjusting the comparison methods in this class will ensure that the behavior is consistent across all field types.\n- 'Field.__eq__' method: This method currently compares fields solely based on 'creation_counter'. To resolve the issue, it should be updated to also consider the model.\n- 'Field.__lt__' method: Currently orders fields based solely on 'creation_counter'. This should be adjusted to allow ordering by model first, but preserving the 'creation_counter' order for cases that are not affected by the equality collision.\n- 'Field.__hash__' method: Currently hashes fields based on 'creation_counter'. It should be adjusted to also consider the model to prevent hash collisions for fields from different models.\n\nThese code spans are directly relevant to the reported issue and provide the necessary context for implementing the fix. The search task can be considered complete based on these findings.",

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
