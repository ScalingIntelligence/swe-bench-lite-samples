The current implementation of the __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods in the Field class only considers the creation_counter for comparison. This can lead to fields from different models being considered equal, which is not the intended behavior. The solution proposed is to modify these methods to also consider the model they belong to. The search results provided include the relevant parts of the Field class, specifically the __eq__, __lt__, and __hash__ methods, as well as the __init__ method where creation_counter is set. These methods need to be adjusted to include a comparison of the model they belong to, ensuring fields from different models do not compare as equal. Therefore, these code spans are relevant to addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
