Specifically, the issue arises because fields only consider `self.creation_counter` when comparing for equality, leading to fields from different abstract model subclasses being considered equal. This results in unexpected behavior when attempting to collect field sets.\n\nTo address this, the solution proposed involves adjusting the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in the `Field` class to incorporate the field's model, ensuring that fields from different models compare as unequal.\n\nFrom the provided search results, the relevant code spans are those that currently define the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods in the `Field` class. These methods are found in the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file under the spans `Field.__eq__`, `Field.__hash__`, and `Field.__lt__`. The current definitions only use `self.creation_counter` for comparison, which is the root cause of the issue. Thus, these sections of the code need to be modified to include a check on `field.model` for differentiating fields from different models. No other significant sections related to this issue were found in the provided context or search results.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the identified code spans are directly related to the issue at hand and should be considered for modification to resolve the reported problem.",

  "initial_message": "Abstract model field should not be equal across models\nDescription\n\t\nConsider the following models:\nclass A(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tabstract = True\n\tmyfield = IntegerField()\nclass B(A):\n\tpass\nclass C(A):\n\tpass\nIf I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
