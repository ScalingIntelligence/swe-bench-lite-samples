The fields compare as equal if they share the same `creation_counter`, which is not intuitive and leads to unexpected behavior when handling sets of fields. The solution involves adjusting the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the `Field` class to consider the model they belong to, ensuring that fields from different models do not compare as equal.",

Specifically, it points out that fields in different models (both inheriting from the same abstract base class) compare as equal due to the current implementation of the equality comparison in the Field class. The solution suggested involves adjusting the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods to incorporate the model attribute, ensuring that fields in different models compare as unequal. The task is to identify the relevant code spans where these comparisons are defined and to consider the potential impacts on other parts of the codebase. \n\nIn the search results, there are several relevant code spans:\n1. In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the `Field` class is defined, which includes the `__eq__` method. This is the primary place where adjustments are needed to account for the model in the equality comparison.\n2. The `Field._description` and `Field.__init__` spans also provide context on how fields are initialized and described, which could be relevant when considering how to integrate the model information into the equality comparison.\n3. The `Model` class in `django/db/models/base.py` provides insight into how models are constructed, which is indirectly relevant to the task of modifying field comparisons.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most relevant span to address the issue is the `Field` class definition in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, specifically where equality comparisons are currently defined. Additional spans from the `Field` class could also provide helpful context for making informed modifications.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
