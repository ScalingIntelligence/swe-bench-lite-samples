The current equality checks are not accounting for differences in the model to which the field belongs. Focus on the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the Field class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` for necessary adjustments. Additionally, consider similar methods in related classes like ModelBase, ModelState, BaseManager, Index, BaseExpression, and UniqueConstraint. The goal is to ensure fields from different models compare as unequal if their `model` attributes differ. Likely, adjusting these methods will involve checking for the `model` attribute before considering `creation_counter`.",

The provided search results include 'Field' class definitions in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' with the relevant methods: '__eq__', '__lt__', and '__hash__'.

This suggests that the `model` attribute, which would be necessary for differentiating fields from different models, is not currently considered in these comparisons. To address the issue, it will be necessary to identify where the `model` attribute is set or can be accessed for instances of `Field` and its subclasses, and then modify the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods to include this attribute in their comparisons. Given the existing context, it appears that the `model` attribute might be set elsewhere, possibly in the `contribute_to_class` method of the `Field` class or in the classes that inherit from `Field`, such as `BooleanField`, `CharField`, `DateField`, and others.

From the provided file context and search results, the relevant code spans include the `Field` class definitions for `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__`, which need to be modified to include the field's model in their comparison logic.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
