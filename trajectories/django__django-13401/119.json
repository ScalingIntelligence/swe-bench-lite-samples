This is crucial to avoid field de-duplication in sets and to maintain field uniqueness when dealing with models B and C derived from abstract model A. The current implementation of Field's equality comparison in Django, which relies solely on 'creation_counter', leads to fields comparing as equal, which is not intuitive and leads to unwanted behavior. The solution involves adjusting Field's methods '__eq__', '__hash__', and '__lt__' to consider the 'model' attribute, ensuring that fields from different models do not compare as equal. This approach is aligned with the adjustments proposed in the issue. The search results include the relevant 'Field' class with its '__eq__', '__hash__', and '__lt__' methods, as well as initialization code, providing the basis for implementing the necessary changes.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
