Fields from different models that inherit from the same abstract model are currently considered equal, which can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to differentiate between fields from different models. The suggested solution is to adjust the __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods in the Field class to consider the field's model. This will ensure that fields from different models are not considered equal. The provided files show potential locations where these methods might be defined. Let's focus our search on the Field class methods in 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py' to accurately reflect the field's model in comparison methods.",

This behavior needs to be adjusted so that fields from different models are considered unequal. The relevant code spans in the provided search results are those related to the `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__` methods of the Field class. These methods currently only consider `creation_counter`, which does not distinguish between fields of different models. To address the issue, these methods should be modified to also consider the `model` attribute of the field. Additionally, these modifications should ensure that the overall behavior and order of fields remain consistent, especially with respect to `creation_counter`. This analysis identifies the necessary code spans that need to be adjusted to implement the required changes.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
