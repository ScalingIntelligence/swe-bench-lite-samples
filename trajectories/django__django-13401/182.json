This leads to unexpected behavior when attempting to create a set of fields from different models. The solution proposed is to adjust the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods to consider the field's model, ensuring fields from different models do not compare as equal. The search results show the relevant parts of the `Field` class in Django's model field definition, which includes the current implementation of `__eq__`, `__lt__`, and `__hash__`. These methods currently rely only on `creation_counter` for comparisons, which aligns with the issue described. The identified spans provide the necessary context to understand how these methods are currently implemented and suggest where modifications might be needed to address the issue.",

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n"
