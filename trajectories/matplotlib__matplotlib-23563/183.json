The code provided initializes a 3D plot and attempts to plot lines in 3D space. The error occurs specifically when the script tries to access the '_verts3d' attribute of a 'Line3D' object after certain operations with numpy arrays. Upon examining the search results, the code in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py' defines the 'Line3D' class, which includes the '__init__' method that initializes '_verts3d' and the 'draw' method that utilizes '_verts3d'. This strongly suggests that the 'Line3D' class definition in the provided file is directly related to the error encountered, as it is where the '_verts3d' attribute should be defined and used. Therefore, the relevant code spans from the '__init__' method to the 'draw' method within the 'Line3D' class in the 'art3d.py' file are identified as crucial for understanding and potentially resolving the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Bug summary\n\nI use matplotlib 3D to visualize some lines in 3D. When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console. I don't know why it happens, so I come here for help.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nx_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nx_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\ny_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\ny_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nz_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nz_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\n\r\nfig = plt.figure()\r\n        ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\r\n        ax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\r\n        ax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\r\n        clr_list = 'r-'\r\n\r\n        for n in range(np.size(z_s_0, axis=0)):\r\n            ax.plot([int(x_s_0[n]), int(x_e_0[n])],\r\n                    [int(y_s_0[n]), int(y_e_0[n])],\r\n                    [int(z_s_0[n]), int(z_e_0[n])], clr_list)\r\n\r\n        plt.xlabel('x')\r\n        plt.ylabel('y')\r\n        # ax.zlabel('z')\r\n        plt.title('90-0')\r\n        plt.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 3444, in run_code\r\n    exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\r\n  File \"<ipython-input-80-e04907066a16>\", line 20, in <module>\r\n    plt.show()\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 368, in show\r\n    return _backend_mod.show(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 29, in __call__\r\n    manager.show(**kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 112, in show\r\n    self.canvas.show()\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 68, in show\r\n    FigureCanvasAgg.draw(self)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py\", line 436, in draw\r\n    self.figure.draw(self.renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 73, in draw_wrapper\r\n    result = draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py\", line 2803, in draw\r\n    mimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\r\n    a.draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\", line 469, in draw\r\n    super().draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", line 3082, in draw\r\n    mimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\r\n    a.draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 215, in draw\r\n    xs3d, ys3d, zs3d = self._verts3d\r\nAttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nSome 3D lines\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating system\n\nLocal: windows + pycharm, Remote: Ubuntu 20.04\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.5.0\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nmodule://backend_interagg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.8.12\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
