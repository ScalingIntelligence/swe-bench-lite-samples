This error is occurring when attempting to visualize 3D lines using matplotlib. The code provided includes the use of `ax.plot` to plot 3D lines, which internally uses the `Line3D` class. Given this context, the relevant code to investigate would be the `Line3D` class and its methods in the `mplot3d` module of matplotlib. From the provided search results, the `Line3D` class is indeed found in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py', and it contains the methods that handle the 3D properties of lines. Specifically, the `Line3D.__init__` method initializes the `_verts3d` attribute, and the `Line3D.draw` method attempts to access it, which could be the point of failure if `_verts3d` is not properly initialized or has been lost. Additionally, the `Axes3D.plot` method in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py' is also relevant as it is responsible for creating `Line3D` objects when plotting 3D lines. These pieces of code are directly related to the reported issue and should be further investigated to identify why the `_verts3d` attribute is missing.",

Additionally, the 'line_2d_to_3d' function and methods in 'Axes3D' provide insights into how 'Line3D' objects are created and manipulated.

The issue seems to be related to how the '_verts3d' attribute is being handled, especially considering data type changes. The 'Line3D' class constructor directly initializes '_verts3d', and the 'set_3d_properties' and 'set_data_3d' methods also manipulate this attribute. In the 'plot' method of 'Axes3D', the 'line_2d_to_3d' function is used to convert 2D lines to 3D, which directly sets the 3D properties of the 'Line3D' object, potentially missing initializing or updating '_verts3d'.

This error can arise due to various reasons, including improper initialization, incorrect data handling, or state issues within the plotting environment. To address this, it's crucial to identify the exact points in the code where the '_verts3d' attribute is manipulated or expected to be present. Given the provided search results, the context seems to be largely focused on the initialization and manipulation of 'Line3D' objects. The search results match the existing context, pointing to specific methods like __init__, set_3d_properties, and set_data_3d, which directly handle the '_verts3d' attribute. Additionally, the search results include the 'juggle_axes' function and the initialization of the 'Axes3D' class, which are relevant as they indirectly influence how the 'Line3D' objects are managed within a 3D plotting context. Therefore, based on the alignment of these code spans with the reported issue, it seems appropriate to mark these parts as relevant.",

The issue seems to be related to how the '_verts3d' attribute is being handled, especially considering data type changes. The 'Line3D' class constructor directly initializes '_verts3d', and the 'set_3d_properties' and 'set_data_3d' methods also manipulate this attribute. In the 'plot' method of 'Axes3D', the 'line_2d_to_3d' function is used to convert 2D lines to 3D, which directly sets the 3D properties of the 'Line3D' object, potentially missing initializing or updating '_verts3d'.

When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them.
