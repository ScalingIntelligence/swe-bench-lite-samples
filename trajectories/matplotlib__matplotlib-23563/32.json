This error occurs intermittently when dealing with different data types, such as numpy arrays and integers, and can only be fixed by restarting the kernel. Given the traceback, focus should be on the 'mpl_toolkits/mplot3d' directory and specifically on the 'art3d.py' file where the 'Line3D' class is defined. The goal is to identify the 'draw' method in the 'Line3D' class to understand how the '_verts3d' attribute is being handled. Additional focus will be on the 'axes3d.py' file where the 'Axes3D' class is defined as it interacts with 3D plot elements.",

This error typically suggests that the 'Line3D' class, which is responsible for 3D line plotting, is not correctly initialized or its attributes are being accessed incorrectly. The provided search results show the implementation of the 'Line3D' class and its methods, including '__init__', 'set_3d_properties', and 'draw'. These methods are critical for initializing and manipulating the 'Line3D' object's attributes correctly. The creation of the '_verts3d' attribute in the '__init__' method and its use in the 'draw' method confirm the expected functionality.

The 'set_3d_properties' method ensures that '_verts3d' is set correctly by broadcasting z values to match the length of x data. The 'draw' method in 'Line3D' processes '_verts3d' for rendering after a 3D transformation. There's also a utility function 'line_2d_to_3d' that modifies a line's class to 'Line3D' and sets its 3D properties. Considering these findings, further search should concentrate on where and how 'Line3D' objects are actually used after their creation or transformation. Additionally, focus on sections of the codebase where these objects might be interacted with numpy arrays or integers that could potentially lead to the absence of '_verts3d' or its improper initialization.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Bug summary\n\nI use matplotlib 3D to visualize some lines in 3D. When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them.
