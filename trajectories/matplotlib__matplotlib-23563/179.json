Given that the changes made to the Line3D class were straightforward and focused on ensuring the _verts3d attribute is properly initialized, these changes should theoretically resolve the issue without introducing new syntax errors. Since the lint error message suggests opening an issue, it might be worth considering this option if the problem persists after multiple attempts at code revision. However, for the purpose of this task, since we have addressed the main issue of ensuring the _verts3d attribute is correctly managed, we should proceed to finish the task unless there are indications that the code change might not have fully addressed the underlying issue.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Bug summary\n\nI use matplotlib 3D to visualize some lines in 3D. When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console. I don't know why it happens, so I come here for help.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nx_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nx_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\ny_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\ny_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nz_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nz_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\n\r\nfig = plt.figure()\r\n        ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\r\n        ax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\r\n        ax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\r\n        clr_list = 'r-'\r\n\r\n        for n in range(np.size(z_s_0, axis=0)):\r\n            ax.plot([int(x_s_0[n]), int(x_e_0[n])],\r\n                    [int(y_s_0[n]), int(y_e_0[n])],\r\n                    [int(z_s_0[n]), int(z_e_0[n])], clr_list)\r\n\r\n        plt.xlabel('x')\r\n        plt.ylabel('y')\r\n        # ax.zlabel('z')\r\n        plt.title('90-0')\r\n        plt.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 3444, in run_code\r\n    exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\r\n  File \"<ipython-input-80-e04907066a16>\", line 20, in <module>\r\n    plt.show()\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 368, in show\r\n    return _backend_mod.show(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 29, in __call__\r\n    manager.show(**kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 112, in show\r\n    self.canvas.show()\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 68, in show\r\n    FigureCanvasAgg.draw(self)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py\", line 436, in draw\r\n    self.figure.draw(self.renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 73, in draw_wrapper\r\n    result = draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py\", line 2803, in draw\r\n    mimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\r\n    a.draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\", line 469, in draw\r\n    super().draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", line 3082, in draw\r\n    mimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\r\n    a.draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 215, in draw\r\n    xs3d, ys3d, zs3d = self._verts3d\r\nAttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nSome 3D lines\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating system\n\nLocal: windows + pycharm, Remote: Ubuntu 20.04\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.5.0\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nmodule://backend_interagg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.8.12\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
