This error arises after certain manipulations with numpy arrays and doesn't resolve without restarting the kernel. The search results provide a comprehensive view of the `Line3D` class within the `mplot3d` module, revealing its methods and properties concerning 3D line drawing. The `__init__` method initializes the `_verts3d` attribute, which is used in the `draw` method to project 3D data into 2D for rendering. The issue likely stems from improper handling or corruption of the `_verts3d` attribute, potentially due to the toggling between numpy arrays and int values in the data. Analyzing the `Line3D` class methods from the search results shows that the `_verts3d` attribute is crucial for rendering the lines in 3D and any corruption or improper initialization could lead to the reported error.",

This error typically occurs when the object's state is corrupted or not properly initialized, which might be due to the changes in data types between numpy arrays and single integers. The provided search results contain the relevant code snippets related to the 'Line3D' class, including its initialization method '__init__' where '_verts3d' is set, the 'draw' method where '_verts3d' is accessed, and the 'set_3d_properties' method which also manipulates '_verts3d'. These sections are crucial for understanding and potentially addressing the issue. Additionally, the 'line_2d_to_3d' function is used to convert 2D lines to 3D, which might be related to the line plotting in the user's code.

When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them.
