            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is an AttributeError stating that 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'. This error typically occurs when an instance of Line3D is expected to have the attribute '_verts3d', but it is missing or has been altered unintentionally. Given the provided code context and search results, it's clear that the '_verts3d' attribute is supposed to be initialized in the '__init__' method of the Line3D class in the file 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py'. The search results confirm that the Line3D class is indeed defined with the 'verts3d' attribute. However, the error suggests that this attribute might not be set as expected in certain scenarios. The relevant code spans are those that define the Line3D class and interact directly with the 'verts3d' attribute, including the '__init__', 'set_3d_properties', 'set_data_3d', 'get_data_3d', and 'draw' methods. These spans are crucial for understanding how the 'verts3d' attribute is managed and why the error might occur. The missing '_verts3d' attribute could be due to incorrect initialization or unintended side effects from other parts of the code that manipulate or override this attribute. Further investigation into the usage of these methods and the overall context in which Line3D objects are created and modified is necessary to pinpoint the root cause of the issue.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Bug summary\n\nI use matplotlib 3D to visualize some lines in 3D. When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console.
