  "initial_message": "[Bug]: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Bug summary\n\nI use matplotlib 3D to visualize some lines in 3D. When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console.
