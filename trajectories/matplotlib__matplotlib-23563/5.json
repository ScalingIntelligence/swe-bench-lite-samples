The problem seems to be that the Line3D object is missing the _verts3d attribute, which is crucial for the draw method in the mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d module. To resolve this, we need to investigate the Line3D class in the art3d.py file and its associated draw method. Additionally, we should also look into how the 3D axes are managed in the axes3d.py file to ensure that the Line3D objects are properly initialized and used.",

The provided context in art3d.py shows that the Line3D class should have the _verts3d attribute, which is assigned during initialization and can be updated through methods like set_3d_properties and set_data_3d. However, the error indicates that this attribute is missing, which suggests that there might be a problem with either the data passed to the Line3D constructor, or some kind of interference that causes the _verts3d attribute to be lost or not properly assigned. Additionally, the Axes3D class's plot method creates and uses Line3D objects, which could be another point of failure if there are issues with the data being plotted or how the z-directional settings are handled.

The provided context in art3d.py shows that the Line3D class should have the _verts3d attribute, which is assigned during initialization and can be updated through methods like set_3d_properties and set_data_3d. However, the error indicates that this attribute is missing, which suggests that there might be a problem with either the data passed to the Line3D constructor, or some kind of interference that causes the _verts3d attribute to be lost or not properly assigned. Additionally, the Axes3D class's plot method creates and uses Line3D objects, which could be another point of failure if there are issues with the data being plotted or how the z-directional settings are handled. To further diagnose this issue, it would be helpful to look for additional instances of Line3D object creation and usage, and to check for any custom logic or overrides that might affect the initialization or manipulation of these objects.",

The initialization of a Line3D object includes setting the _verts3d attribute to the provided xs, ys, and zs values. Additionally, the set_3d_properties() and set_data_3d() methods are available to update the _verts3d attribute. The draw() method uses this attribute to project the 3D coordinates and draw the line in 2D space. Furthermore, the Axes3D class in the axes3d.py file contains the plot() method, which creates Line3D objects. However, an issue with the _verts3d attribute being 'None' could arise if the data passed to the Line3D constructor is not correctly formatted or manipulated before being passed.

This attribute is crucial as it stores the 3D coordinates of the lines being plotted. The issue arises when transitioning between different types of input (numpy arrays and int numbers) which seems to confuse the 'Line3D' object's state. The provided code and error traceback clearly indicate that the '_verts3d' attribute is accessed during the draw method of the 'Line3D' class, but it is missing, leading to the AttributeError. Digging into the search results, one can see that the 'Line3D' class indeed has methods and initializations related to '_verts3d', confirming that this attribute should exist. The search results also show the 'Axes3D' class, which is capable of plotting 3D data including lines. The method 'plot' in 'Axes3D' uses 'line_2d_to_3d' to convert 2D lines to 3D, which might be a relevant area considering the code snippet provided by the user. Given this, relevant code spans should include those where '_verts3d' is defined, accessed, or modified, and other parts of the code that might show how 'Line3D' objects are managed or how data is inputted and processed for plotting in 3D.",

The initialization of a Line3D object includes setting the _verts3d attribute to the provided xs, ys, and zs values. Additionally, the set_3d_properties() and set_data_3d() methods are available to update the _verts3d attribute. The draw() method uses this attribute to project the 3D coordinates and draw the line in 2D space. Furthermore, the Axes3D class in the axes3d.py file contains the plot() method, which creates Line3D objects. However, an issue with the _verts3d attribute being 'None' could arise if the data passed to the Line3D constructor is not correctly formatted or manipulated before being passed. This could be due to either a bug in the user's script or an error in how the data is processed in custom overrides or extensions of the Line3D or Axes3D classes.",
