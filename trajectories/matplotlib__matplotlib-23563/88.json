The key part of the error is the missing attribute '_verts3d' in the 'Line3D' object. To address this, I need to identify the sections of code in the search results that are related to the initialization, setting, and drawing of 'Line3D' objects. The relevant code spans include the definition of the 'Line3D' class, its methods for setting 3D properties and data, and the drawing method where the '_verts3d' attribute is expected.\n\n1. Analyzing User Instructions:\nThe reported issue is clear about the error and the context in which it occurs, involving the 'Line3D' object in matplotlib's 3D plotting functionality.\n\n2. Review Current Context:\nNo relevant code has been identified yet, so I need to find the relevant sections in the provided search results.\n\n3. Process New Search Results:\n3.1. Analyzing each code span:\n   - The 'Line3D' class definition and its methods 'set_3d_properties', 'set_data_3d', 'get_data_3d', and 'draw' are crucial as they directly involve the '_verts3d' attribute or its usage.\n   - The 'Line3D.__init__' method initializes the '_verts3d' attribute, and the 'draw' method uses it for rendering the 3D lines.\n   - The 'Text3D' and 'Path3DCollection' classes are not directly relevant to the '_verts3d' attribute but could provide context on other 3D plotting functionalities.\n\n3.2. Matching code spans with the reported issue:\n   - The 'Line3D' class and its methods align with the error message, particularly the missing '_verts3d' attribute.\n\n3.3. Evaluating relevance based on alignment with the issue:\n   - The 'Line3D' class and its methods are directly relevant as they handle the attribute causing the error.\n\n3.4. Identifying relevant code spans:\n   - 'Line3D.__init__' for initialization.\n   - 'Line3D.set_3d_properties', 'Line3D.set_data_3d', and 'Line3D.get_data_3d' for managing the '_verts3d' attribute.\n   - 'Line3D.draw' for rendering where the error occurs.\n\nThese spans are crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the issue with the 'Line3D' object and its '_verts3d' attribute.",

This error occurs after a series of operations involving the plotting of 3D lines with Matplotlib. The error suggests that the 'Line3D' object is not properly initialized or its internal state is corrupted. This could be due to inconsistent handling of the 'Line3D' object, especially when switching between numpy arrays and int numbers for the plot data. The provided file context and search results contain relevant code spans, particularly in the 'Line3D' class definition in 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py', which includes methods such as '__init__', 'set_3d_properties', 'set_data_3d', 'get_data_3d', and 'draw'. These methods are directly related to the creation and manipulation of 'Line3D' objects and their 3D properties. The 'draw' method, in particular, attempts to access '_verts3d' to project the 3D data for rendering. Additional relevant code spans include the 'line_2d_to_3d' function, which converts a 2D line to a 3D line, and other related classes like 'Patch3DCollection', 'Path3DCollection', and 'Poly3DCollection'. These classes might also interact with 'Line3D' objects or contribute to the issue by altering the state of these objects in a way that leads to the AttributeError. The search results also include code spans in other files such as 'axis3d.py' and 'axes3d.py', which could provide additional context on how 'Line3D' objects are managed within the broader framework of the Matplotlib 3D plotting capabilities.",

Given that the attribute is set properly during initialization and can be updated through well-defined methods, the issue might not be originating from the management of the _verts3d attribute within the Line3D class itself. However, it's crucial to examine the broader usage context, specifically focusing on where and how Line3D instances are being manipulated or interacted with outside the class definition.

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Bug summary\n\nI use matplotlib 3D to visualize some lines in 3D. When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console. I don't know why it happens, so I come here for help.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nx_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nx_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\ny_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\ny_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nz_s_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\nz_e_0 = np.array(['my int number list'])\r\n\r\nfig = plt.figure()\r\n        ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')\r\n        ax.view_init(elev=90, azim=0)\r\n        ax.set_zlim3d(-10, 10)\r\n        clr_list = 'r-'\r\n\r\n        for n in range(np.size(z_s_0, axis=0)):\r\n            ax.plot([int(x_s_0[n]), int(x_e_0[n])],\r\n                    [int(y_s_0[n]), int(y_e_0[n])],\r\n                    [int(z_s_0[n]), int(z_e_0[n])], clr_list)\r\n\r\n        plt.xlabel('x')\r\n        plt.ylabel('y')\r\n        # ax.zlabel('z')\r\n        plt.title('90-0')\r\n        plt.show()\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 3444, in run_code\r\n    exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\r\n  File \"<ipython-input-80-e04907066a16>\", line 20, in <module>\r\n    plt.show()\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", line 368, in show\r\n    return _backend_mod.show(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 29, in __call__\r\n    manager.show(**kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 112, in show\r\n    self.canvas.show()\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/.pycharm_helpers/pycharm_matplotlib_backend/backend_interagg.py\", line 68, in show\r\n    FigureCanvasAgg.draw(self)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py\", line 436, in draw\r\n    self.figure.draw(self.renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 73, in draw_wrapper\r\n    result = draw(artist, renderer, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py\", line 2803, in draw\r\n    mimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\r\n    a.draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\", line 469, in draw\r\n    super().draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", line 3082, in draw\r\n    mimage._draw_list_compositing_images(\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/image.py\", line 132, in _draw_list_compositing_images\r\n    a.draw(renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/artist.py\", line 50, in draw_wrapper\r\n    return draw(artist, renderer)\r\n  File \"/home/hanyaning/anaconda3/envs/SBeA/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py\", line 215, in draw\r\n    xs3d, ys3d, zs3d = self._verts3d\r\nAttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nSome 3D lines\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating system\n\nLocal: windows + pycharm, Remote: Ubuntu 20.04\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.5.0\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nmodule://backend_interagg\n\n### Python version\n\n3.8.12\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n"
