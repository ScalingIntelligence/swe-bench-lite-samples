The search results include the 'Line3D' class definition with methods like '__init__', 'set_3d_properties', 'set_data_3d', 'get_data_3d', and 'draw'. These are directly relevant as they are responsible for initializing, setting, getting, and drawing the 3D lines. Additionally, the 'Axes3D' class includes methods like 'plot', 'plot_wireframe', 'plot_trisurf', 'quiver', and 'voxels', which also interact with or contribute to the 3D plotting functionality, though they are less directly linked to the '_verts3d' attribute. The most pertinent parts of the code for addressing the issue, therefore, are those handling the '_verts3d' attribute directly within the 'Line3D' class.",
