The error traceback also suggests that the issue might be related to the 'draw' method of the 'Line3D' class. Therefore, it would be beneficial to look into the 'art3d.py' file within the 'mpl_toolkits/mplot3d' directory for the 'Line3D' class implementation and its 'draw' method.",

This indicates that the 'Line3D' class, specifically its methods that interact with '_verts3d', are the primary focus for identifying relevant code spans.\n\nFirst, I reviewed the 'Line3D' class definition and its methods in the provided code spans. Notably, the '__init__' method initializes '_verts3d' and the 'draw' method attempts to access '_verts3d'. Additionally, 'set_3d_properties' and 'set_data_3d' methods modify '_verts3d', which is crucial for understanding how the attribute is managed.\n\nGiven the issue description, it seems like an incorrect state or initialization of the 'Line3D' object could be causing the '_verts3d' attribute to be missing. This could be due to improper use of 'set_3d_properties' or 'set_data_3d' methods.\n\nTherefore, the identified spans include the '__init__', 'set_3d_properties', 'set_data_3d', 'get_data_3d', and 'draw' methods of the 'Line3D' class, as these directly deal with the '_verts3d' attribute that is central to the reported issue. Additionally, 'line_2d_to_3d', which transforms a 2D line into a 3D line and sets its 3D properties, could also be relevant if it affects the initialization or transition of line objects into the 3D space. Similarly, 'juggle_axes', which adjusts the axis data based on the z-direction, might impact how data is transformed and could indirectly relate to errors involving '_verts3d'.\n\nThese selections are made based on their direct interaction with the attribute and potential influences on its state or existence, which are critical for addressing the reported issue.",

To further investigate, it's crucial to examine how 'Line3D' objects are used in contexts where data types are switched, especially in functions that call 'ax.plot' for 3D plots. This includes checking if the data passed to these functions is consistent and correctly handled, and ensuring that no state changes or side effects within 'Line3D' objects could lead to the '_verts3d' attribute being improperly referenced or set.",
