This error occurs when attempting to access the '_verts3d' attribute within the 'Line3D' class. The error suggests that there might be an initialization issue or a modification of the 'Line3D' object that leads to the loss of this attribute. The provided search results contain the definition and functionalities of the 'Line3D' class from the 'mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d' module. Specifically, the class 'Line3D' initializes with '_verts3d' in its constructor, provides a method to retrieve it, and uses it in the 'draw' method. This aligns directly with the reported issue, making these spans highly relevant to addressing the problem. Therefore, these code spans should be identified as relevant to the issue, providing insight into how the 'Line3D' object should be handled and potentially where the initialization or usage might be going wrong.",

This attribute is crucial for the 3D plotting functionality as it stores the 3D coordinates of the lines. The user's code attempts to plot 3D lines but encounters this error. The relevant code spans from the search results should include parts of the 'Line3D' class definition from 'mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py' that handle the '_verts3d' attribute, including its initialization, setting, and accessing.

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns an AttributeError related to a 'Line3D' object lacking the '_verts3d' attribute. This error is likely occurring during the drawing process of the 'Line3D' object. The provided code snippet uses 'ax.plot' for drawing lines in 3D which internally uses the 'Line3D' class. The initial analysis of the 'art3d.py' file indicates that the 'Line3D' class does indeed have an '_verts3d' attribute, which is used in the 'draw' method to transform and set the data before calling the superclass's 'draw' method. This suggests that the error might arise due to incorrect handling or initialization of the '_verts3d' attribute in 'Line3D' instances. The search results confirm the presence of the 'Line3D' class and its methods including the 'draw' method that uses '_verts3d'. The 'Axes3D.plot' method also confirms the use of 'line_2d_to_3d' to convert 2D lines to 3D, potentially creating instances of 'Line3D'. To address the issue, it would be beneficial to ensure that the '_verts3d' attribute is correctly initialized and used, potentially focusing on how 'line_2d_to_3d' and the 'Line3D' initialization process integrate with the plotting mechanisms in 'Axes3D'. Additionally, examining any updates or mutations that might affect the '_verts3d' attribute after initialization could provide further insight. Looking at both the 'Axes3D.plot' method and the 'Line3D' class in detail would be crucial for identifying the root cause of the AttributeError.",
