This error typically occurs when trying to access the '_verts3d' attribute of a 'Line3D' instance that has not been properly initialized or has been incorrectly modified. The search results include the definition of the 'Line3D' class in 'mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py', which initializes and uses the '_verts3d' attribute. This attribute is crucial for storing the 3D coordinates of the line. Additionally, 'Axes3D' class in 'mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py' is also relevant as it is used to create and manipulate 3D plots. The 'Line3D' class and its methods, such as 'set_3d_properties' and 'draw', are directly relevant to the issue as they handle the 3D line data and its rendering. The 'Axes3D' class is important for understanding the context in which 'Line3D' objects are used, especially in the creation of 3D plots and the management of axes limits. The search results do not provide direct code examples for reproduction or a solution, but they offer a clear understanding of how the 'Line3D' class should behave and where the '_verts3d' attribute is expected to be used. The code spans provided are sufficient to diagnose the issue and understand the necessary elements for a potential fix.",

  "initial_message": "[Bug]: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'\n### Bug summary\n\nI use matplotlib 3D to visualize some lines in 3D. When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them. The error can be only fixed when I restart the kernel of ipython console.
