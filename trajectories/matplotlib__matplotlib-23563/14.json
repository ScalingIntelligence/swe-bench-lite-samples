The user provided a code snippet that uses `ax.plot` with 3D coordinates, and the error occurs when switching between numpy arrays and int numbers for the coordinates. The error traceback points to the `Line3D` class in the `art3d.py` file. Therefore, I will focus my search on this class and related methods. From the search results, it's clear that the `Line3D` class does define a `_verts3d` attribute in its `__init__` method and it has a `draw` method that uses this attribute. Additionally, there is an `Axes3D.draw` method in the `axes3d.py` file that could be related since it manages the drawing of 3D axes, which might include the `Line3D` objects. The `Axis.draw` method in `axis3d.py` is also relevant as it handles the drawing of 3D axis ticks and labels. These methods, especially `Line3D.draw`, are crucial for understanding how the _verts3d attribute is supposed to be accessed and used.\n\nAlso, considering the error message and the context provided, the issue could be arising from an improper initialization or reuse of the 'Line3D' objects, especially with the switching of variable types. This might cause the '_verts3d' attribute to be missing or incorrectly handled. Thus, the identified code spans provide a good starting point to investigate and fix the reported issue.",

When I first run the following code, the code can run right. But, if I give `x_s_0[n]` a numpy array, it will report the error 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping'. The point is when next I give  `x_s_0[n]` and other variables an int number, the AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' will appear and can not be fixed whatever I change the variables or delete them.
