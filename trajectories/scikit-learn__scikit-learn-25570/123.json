Upon analyzing the search results, I identified the relevant code spans within the ColumnTransformer class that are directly related to the reported issue. The key sections include the `_iter` method where transformers are iterated over, the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` method where feature names are processed, and the `_hstack` method where the actual stacking of transformed outputs occurs.

It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is some code to reproduce the error.
