The user provides a code snippet illustrating the error, and it specifically points to lines 856 and 859 in _column_transformer.py which handle the fitting and the addition of prefixes for feature names out. Analyzing the new search results, I can identify several relevant spans of code: 1. ColumnTransformer's __init__ function which initializes the parameters that are critical for understanding how transformers are configured. 2. _get_feature_name_out_for_transformer which deals with generating feature names out for transformers, including handling when transformers are set to 'drop'. 3. _add_prefix_for_feature_names_out responsible for adding prefixes to feature names and handling potential name collisions. 4. _hstack, which is noted to be the method that gathers the transformed features together, and where the error is likely to occur due to mismatched lengths. These spans, along with the initialization parameters and how feature names are managed, would be critical for addressing the reported issue.",

  "initial_message": "ColumnTransformer with pandas output can't handle transformers with no features\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nColumnTransformer doesn't deal well with transformers that apply to 0 features (categorical_features in the example below) when using \"pandas\" as output. It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is some code to reproduce the error. If you remove .set_output(transform=\"pandas\") on the line before last, all works fine.
