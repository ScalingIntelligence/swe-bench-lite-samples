Additionally, we should look into how transformers with 0 features are handled during the fitting process.",

Specifically, the problem arises when a transformer with 0 features is used and the output type is set to 'pandas'. This scenario leads to issues in the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` method and the `_hstack` method, where the code breaks due to mismatch in the expected number of feature columns or the manner in which the columns are handled when transforming to pandas DataFrame. The provided search results contain the `ColumnTransformer` class and its methods along with the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` and `_hstack` methods, all of which seem relevant based on the error description in the issue. The remaining bit seems to be clarification on how the `categorical` step with 0 features is handled in these methods, and whether the expected behavior (ignoring steps with 0 features when output type is 'pandas') is implemented correctly, which is not covered solely by the provided code spans and requires further investigation into the actual implementation and interaction among these methods.

  "initial_message": "ColumnTransformer with pandas output can't handle transformers with no features\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nColumnTransformer doesn't deal well with transformers that apply to 0 features (categorical_features in the example below) when using \"pandas\" as output. It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is some code to reproduce the error. If you remove .set_output(transform=\"pandas\") on the line before last, all works fine. If you remove the (\"categorical\", ...) step, it works fine too.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\r\nfrom sklearn.compose import
