The issue occurs because steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` and cause an error in `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out`.\n\nFrom the provided search results, it's clear that the relevant sections of the codebase are located within the `ColumnTransformer` class in `sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py`. The focus is specifically on the methods `_iter`, `fit_transform`, and `_hstack`, as these are the critical areas where the problem arises and are likely to require modifications to resolve the issue.\n\nIn `_iter`, the method responsible for iterating over the transformers, there is a logic to replace 'passthrough' with an identity transformer and skip if 'drop'. This alignment suggests that this method is directly related to the handling of transformers and their columns. Similarly, `fit_transform` is crucial as it orchestrates the fitting and transforming process, and `_hstack` is involved in the concatenation of results, which is where the error reported by the user occurs when dealing with pandas output.\n\nGiven the context and the provided code snippets, these sections are highly relevant to addressing the reported bug. Therefore, I will identify these spans as relevant to the issue.",

  "initial_message": "ColumnTransformer with pandas output can't handle transformers with no features\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nColumnTransformer doesn't deal well with transformers that apply to 0 features (categorical_features in the example below) when using \"pandas\" as output. It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is some code to reproduce the error. If you remove .set_output(transform=\"pandas\") on the line before last, all works fine. If you remove the (\"categorical\", ...) step, it works fine too.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\r\nfrom sklearn.compose import
