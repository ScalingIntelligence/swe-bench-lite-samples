The issue specifically points out that 'bell(n).limit(n, oo)' should return infinity but currently returns 'bell(oo)'. The search results provide several relevant files and code spans. First, the 'numbers.py' file contains the definition of the 'bell' function which is directly related to the Bell numbers. The code span 'nT' in this file also includes logic related to Bell numbers, particularly where it checks if N equals the number of distinct items and returns 'bell(N)' if k is None, indicating an absence of natural number for k. Second, 'expr.py' contains the 'limit' method for Expr class, which is likely where the limit calculation logic for expressions involving 'bell(n)' resides. Third, 'series/limits.py' contains the 'limit' function, which processes the limit and could reveal how 'bell(n)' behaves under limit operations. Lastly, 'gruntz.py' contains more complex limit calculation logic which could be relevant if the limit involves special handling like those for infinity. Based on these observations, the relevant code spans are identified below.",

Additionally, there are other combinatorial number definitions that might be relevant for context, such as `fibonacci` and `lucas` in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`.

This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
