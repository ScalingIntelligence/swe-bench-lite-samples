The relevant parts of the code likely involve the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, and possibly the handling of infinity in `sympy/core/numbers.py`. To fix this, we need to understand how to evaluate `bell(oo)` to `oo` or how to adjust the `limit` function's behavior for `bell(n)`.",

From the search results, the class `bell` in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` contains the definition of the `bell` function. The method `_bell` calculates the Bell number for a given `n`. Additionally, the file `sympy/series/limits.py` contains the `limit` function and its associated logic, which is likely where the issue resides. The `bell.eval` method seems to handle the evaluation of the `bell` function, but it may not be considering the case when `n` approaches infinity. The `limit` function in `limits.py` is responsible for computing limits, and it should be checked for how it handles functions like `bell(n)` when `n` approaches infinity.",

The current output is `bell(oo)`, which is not the expected behavior. To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code that handle the evaluation of the Bell numbers and their limits. The code spans provided include the `bell` function definition and its various methods like `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval`. Additionally, the `limits.py` file contains the `limit` function and the `Limit` class, which are instrumental in determining the limit of the Bell numbers as `n` approaches infinity. These sections are crucial for understanding how the limit is currently being evaluated and how it might be corrected. By examining these sections, we can determine the necessary changes to ensure that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` correctly evaluates to infinity.",

        "message": "The issue has been resolved with the modification made to the `bell` class. Specifically, the `eval` method now correctly handles the case where `n` is `S.Infinity`, returning `S.Infinity` instead of `bell(oo)`. This change ensures that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` evaluates properly to `S.Infinity`, aligning with the expected behavior and similar functions in the library.",

  "initial_message": "bell(n).limit(n, oo) should be oo rather than bell(oo)\n`bell(n).limit(n,oo)` should take the value infinity, but the current output is `bell(oo)`. As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
