The key function to examine is `bell(n)` within the `numbers.py` file, particularly the `nT` function which potentially relates to the Bell numbers and their computation. This context also requires checking how the `limit` function is implemented in the `expr.py` and `limits.py` files to understand how the limit calculation operates. Additionally, the `limit` method defined in the `MatrixCalculus` class within the `matrices.py` file suggests a broader usage of the limit function within the library, which is also relevant for understanding the overall design and potential edge cases. Currently, no relevant code spans have been identified from the file context, which means starting fresh with the search results.\n\nThe analysis of the search results indicates that the `nT` function within the `numbers.py` file directly pertains to the computation of Bell numbers (as suggested by the return of `bell(N)` when `N == n[_ITEMS]`). This strongly suggests that modifications to address the reported issue should primarily occur here. The `limit` function definition in `expr.py` and its handling in `limits.py` should be considered for adjustments necessary to achieve the desired limit behavior for `bell(n)`. The further exploration in the `MatrixCalculus` class and the general `limit` method in `expr.py` confirms that the limit function is crucial across different parts of the codebase, which underscores its significance in handling various mathematical operations efficiently.\n\nGiven this analysis, the identified spans from `numbers.py`, `expr.py`, and `limits.py` are deemed relevant to the reported issue and should be considered for any necessary modifications. The `MatrixCalculus` class and its `limit` method, while not directly related, provide a broader context that could influence how limits are implemented and understood within the SymPy library.",

From the provided file context and search results, the relevant files include `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`. The `bell` function definition is located in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, and the `limit` method for `Expr` objects is defined in `sympy/core/expr.py`. Both files have been identified as relevant based on the context provided. The key spans to focus on are the `bell` class definition and the `limit` method in the `Expr` class, as these are directly related to the functionality in question. Other parts of the codebase, like `TupleArg.limit` and `MatrixCalculus.limit`, although they also involve the `limit` method, do not seem directly relevant to the `bell` function's limit computation.

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
