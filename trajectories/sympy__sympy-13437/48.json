The expected output is infinity (`oo`), but the current output is `bell(oo)`, which remains unevaluated. This issue is related to the handling of limits for the Bell numbers. The search results provide several relevant code spans in the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py` files. In `numbers.py`, the `bell` class and its methods (`_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, `eval`) are crucial as they define the behavior of the Bell numbers function. The `bell.eval` method is particularly important as it determines how `bell(n)` is evaluated. In `limits.py`, the `limit` function and related methods are responsible for handling limits, including the behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`. The `Limit.doit` method is key as it performs the limit computation. Given this context, the identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of where changes might be needed to address the issue.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
