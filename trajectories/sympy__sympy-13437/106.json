The issue suggests that the current output `bell(oo)` is unexpected and should be evaluated to infinity instead. This implies that the code responsible for handling the limit of the Bell function with respect to `n` approaching infinity needs examination. In the provided search results, the `numbers.py` file contains the definition of the `bell` function, which might be relevant as it defines the Bell numbers. The `limits.py` file contains general limit handling functions including `limit` and `Limit.doit`, which are likely places where the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity would be computed. Specifically, the `Limit.doit` method is a critical part where the actual limit computation occurs. To fix the issue, one would need to modify how the limit of `bell(n)` is evaluated when `n` approaches infinity, perhaps by adding special handling for the Bell function in the `heuristics` method or directly in the `Limit.doit` method.",

The provided search results and file context contain relevant code spans that handle the limit calculation for functions. Specifically, the code related to the `Limit` class and its `doit` method in 'sympy/series/limits.py' is crucial as it contains the logic for evaluating limits. The existing context already includes the `Limit.doit` method which is responsible for evaluating the limit using various strategies like `gruntz`, `heuristics`, and handling infinity. The new search results provide additional context on how `Limit` objects are created and how the `doit` method is invoked. These code spans are relevant because they help understand how the limit of functions, including potentially `bell(n)`, are evaluated in Sympy. The 'Limit.doit' method is particularly important as it determines the value of the limit based on the expression, variable, and direction specified. By understanding and potentially modifying this method, a fix for the issue with `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` can be implemented, ensuring that the limit evaluates to infinity as expected.",

The relevant code spans are found in the `Limit` class and its methods in `sympy/series/limits.py`, which handle the computation of limits. Specifically, the `doit` method of the `Limit` class is crucial as it carries out the actual computation of the limit. The `heuristics` function also plays a role in the process by applying heuristics to simplify expressions before the limit is computed. Additionally, the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` involves computations that could have an impact on how `bell(n)` behaves as `n` approaches infinity.

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
