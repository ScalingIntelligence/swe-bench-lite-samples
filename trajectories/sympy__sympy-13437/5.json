The expected output is `oo` (infinity), but the current output is `bell(oo)`, which is not evaluated. The focus should be on the `bell` function and its associated methods within the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file, particularly the `eval` method for the `bell` function. Additionally, understanding how limits are handled in `sympy/series/limits.py` is crucial because the issue is related to the limit functionality. The `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` is responsible for evaluating limits, and it appears to use heuristics and gruntz methods to compute limits, which may need to be adjusted or extended to properly handle the Bell numbers case.\n\nFrom the search results, the `bell` function and its methods in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` are relevant because they directly relate to the Bell numbers. Specifically, the `_bell` method computes Bell numbers using recurrence, and the `eval` method evaluates the Bell number expression. The `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` method also looks relevant as it rewrites the Bell number as a sum, which might be used in handling the limit.\n\nIn `sympy/series/limits.py`, the `limit` function and the `heuristics` method are key as they implement the logic for computing limits. The `Limit` class and its `doit` method are also relevant as they manage the actual computation of limits and may need to be adjusted to accommodate the Bell numbers properly. The `grntz` method for handling more complex limits might also be relevant but is not included in the provided search results.\n\nOverall, the relevant spans include the `bell.eval`, `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum`, and potentially the `limit` and `heuristics` methods in the limits module.

This pattern could be replicated in the `bell` function class to address the issue where `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` should return `S.Infinity` but currently returns `bell(oo)`. By adding a condition to check if `n` is `S.Infinity` within the `eval` method of the `bell` class and returning `S.Infinity` accordingly, we can resolve this issue. Additionally, we should inspect the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` to ensure that it correctly handles the evaluation of limits for combinatorial functions like `bell`, possibly by improving the `heuristics` function to better manage these cases.",
