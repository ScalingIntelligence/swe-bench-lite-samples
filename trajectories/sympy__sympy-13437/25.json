This is similar to the recent fixes for the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. It's likely that the fix will involve modifying the `bell` class or the `limit` function to correctly handle the limit as `n` approaches infinity. The provided files suggest that `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py` are the main files to focus on for this issue. The `bell` class definition and the `limit` function should be the main areas of interest for modifications. Given the context, I will specify these files for the search and focus on the `bell` class and `limit` function.",

Similar handling exists in the `fibonacci` and `lucas` classes' `eval` methods, where if `n` is infinity, it should return infinity. This case can be added to the `bell.eval` method to resolve the issue. Two relevant spans are identified, both located within the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file: the 'bell.eval' span, which currently does not have handling for the case of infinity, and the 'fibonacci.eval' span, which is similar to the expected changes for 'bell.eval'.",

These spans cover the import statements, the limit function itself, and the doit method of the Limit class. The 'heuristics' span indicates how the limit function processes different types of expressions. The 'Limit.doit' span is particularly important, as it shows how the limit is computed and what transformations are applied to the expression under consideration.

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
