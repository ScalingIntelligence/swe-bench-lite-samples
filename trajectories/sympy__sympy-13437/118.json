To address this, it's necessary to identify the relevant code spans within the `numbers.py` file where the `bell` function is defined and implemented. Further, understanding how the `limit` function in the `limits.py` file interacts with the `bell` function will be crucial for the workaround or fix. \n\n1. The `bell` class and its methods like `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval` are directly relevant as they define the behavior of the `bell` function.\n2. The `limit` function defined in `limits.py` is also crucial as it is responsible for calculating limits, which is specifically needed to address the issue reported.\n3. Given the nature of the reported issue, understanding how limits are currently calculated and the interaction with combinatorial functions like `bell` will guide in deciding the correct approach to modify or adjust the `bell` function's behavior for large values of `n`.\n4. By focusing on these sections, it's possible to determine a strategy to adjust the `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` method or `eval` method of the `bell` class in a way that enables the limit calculation as expected.\n\nOverall, these considerations guide the process of identifying the exact code spans that must be reviewed and potentially modified to solve the reported issue.",

Specifically, the `bell` class and its methods such as `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval` are related to the calculation of Bell numbers. Additionally, the `limit` function and its heuristics in `limits.py` are crucial for understanding how limits are computed in SymPy, which is directly related to the issue. From the search results, the code spans labeled 'bell', 'bell._bell', 'bell._bell_poly', 'bell._bell_incomplete_poly', 'bell.eval', and 'limit' are highly relevant to addressing the reported issue.
