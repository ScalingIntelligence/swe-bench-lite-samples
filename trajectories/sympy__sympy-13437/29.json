The key areas to examine are the `bell` class definition and its methods, particularly `eval` and `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum`, which deal with evaluation and rewrites into summations respectively. The `eval` method is crucial as it determines the output for specific inputs. It needs to be checked and possibly modified to handle the limit when `n` approaches infinity, ensuring it doesn't return an unevaluated form but the actual limit value (infinity in this case).\n\nBy analyzing the search results, the `bell.eval` span and the broader context around it, including how it handles integers and the different cases (with or without `k_sym` and `symbols`), will help pinpoint the exact location for modifying or enhancing the logic to fix this issue. Additionally, looking at methods like `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` can provide insight into whether re-implementing or extending its capabilities could indirectly solve the limit issue by improving the function's overall handling of special cases and deep mathematical properties.",

To address this, we need to find the relevant code spans that handle the limit computation for the Bell function. Examining the provided contexts and search results, the crucial code spans are found within the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file, specifically in the `bell` class and its methods. Notably, the `bell.eval`, `bell._eval_rewrite_as_Sum`, and `bell` class itself are relevant due to their involvement in defining and handling Bell numbers. Additionally, the `sympy/series/gruntz.py` file contains functions that are likely involved in the limit computation, such as `mrv`, `limitinf`, `sign`, and `compare`. These functions may need to be adjusted or referenced to correctly implement the limit for `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity. Given the provided contexts and search results, these code spans are sufficient to understand and potentially modify the behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`.",

While there is code for handling limits in `sympy/series/gruntz.py`, it is not directly related to the `bell` function. Thus, further analysis is needed to see if the limit functionality should be integrated into the `bell` class or if it should leverage existing functionalities within the Sympy library. Also, the suggestion to model handling infinity after recent fixes for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers is important to consider.
