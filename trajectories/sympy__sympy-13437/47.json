To address this, we need to investigate how the `bell` function and the `limit` function are implemented and interact. We should focus on the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file, which contains the definition of the `bell` class, and the `sympy/series/limits.py` file, which contains the definition of the `limit` function. Additionally, we should explore other related files that might influence this behavior, such as `sympy/core/numbers.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py`, which deal with mathematical expressions and special numbers like infinity.",

This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of similar functions like Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, which correctly evaluate to `S.Infinity` when `n` is `S.Infinity`.
