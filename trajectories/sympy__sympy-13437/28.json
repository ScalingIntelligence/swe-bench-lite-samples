The reported issue indicates that the limit of Bell numbers as n approaches infinity should evaluate to infinity, but currently, it returns `bell(oo)` unevaluated. This suggests we need to look at the implementation of the Bell numbers and the limit calculation.\n\nFirst, in the search results from `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, we find the `bell` class and its methods, including `eval` and `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum`. These methods are crucial as they handle the evaluation and rewriting of the Bell numbers. Specifically, the `eval` method checks if n is an integer and non-negative, which is a starting point for evaluating Bell numbers.\n\nAdditionally, in `sympy/series/limits.py`, we find the `limit` function and related classes like `Limit` and `heuristics`. The `limit` function is the main entry point for calculating limits, and the `Limit.doit` method performs the actual computation. The `heuristics` function handles some special cases and simplifications before passing the expression to the `gruntz` algorithm, which is a more complex limit-finding method.\n\nGiven the issue's focus on the limit of Bell numbers, the relevant code spans are those in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` that define and evaluate Bell numbers (`bell`, `bell.eval`, `bell._eval_rewrite_as_Sum`) and those in `sympy/series/limits.py` that handle limit computations (`limit`, `Limit.doit`, `heuristics`). These sections should provide a comprehensive view of where the issue might reside and how it might be fixed.\n\nTo sum up, the relevant code spans include the definition and evaluation methods of Bell numbers and the functions responsible for computing limits, as these are directly related to the reported issue.",

To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans in the `bell` class and its methods, as well as the logic in the `limit` function from `sympy/series/limits.py`. The current implementation of `bell.eval` and `bell._eval_rewrite_as_Sum` does not handle the case where `n` is `S.Infinity`. There is also a need to evaluate if the `limit` function correctly handles the evaluation of `bell(n)` for large `n`. The provided search results include multiple spans related to the `bell` function and its methods, as well as the `limit` function and its related methods. These spans include the definition of `bell` and its methods like `eval` and `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum`, which are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the behavior when `n` approaches infinity. Additionally, the `limit` function and its associated logic are also relevant as they dictate how limits are computed in Sympy. Some of these spans, such as `lucas.eval` and `bernoulli.eval`, while not directly related to the `bell` function, can provide contextual understanding about how limits and infinite cases are handled for other functions in Sympy. Based on the relevance to the reported issue and the clarity provided by the context, the identified spans are chosen.",

This suggests that the limit evaluation for the Bell numbers is not correctly handling infinity. Given the existing context, I identified the relevant code spans in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` that define the `bell` function and its methods like `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, and `_bell_incomplete_poly`. These methods compute Bell numbers and polynomials, which are central to the issue. In the `sympy/series/limits.py` file, the `limit` function and `Limit.doit` method are crucial as they handle the limit computations. The `heuristics` function is also relevant as it applies heuristic methods to compute limits when more direct methods fail. From the new search results, it confirms the presence of the `limit` function and its related methods in `limits.py`. I will now identify the specific code spans that are relevant to the issue from these search results.",

The file context provides the implementation of the `bell` function in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, but does not directly show the implementation of the `.limit()` method for the `bell` function in the `sympy/series/limits.py` file. The `bell` class itself does not have a `.limit()` method or any direct handling of limits in the provided code. Therefore, relevant code handling the limit for the `bell` function is missing in the file context. This suggests the need to look further into how limits are handled in the larger context of SymPy, potentially by understanding how limits are computed for other combinatorial functions within the `sympy/series/limits.py` file, which might provide clues on how to modify for `bell`.",

Also, check the `heuristics` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` as it may contain logic applicable to the `bell` function's limit behavior. Look for any recent changes or bug fixes in handling limits for functions similar to `bell`, like Fibonacci or Lucas numbers, and see if these changes can be adapted for the `bell` function."
