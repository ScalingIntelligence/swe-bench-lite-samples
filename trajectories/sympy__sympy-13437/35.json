To address this, we need to look for code spans related to the `limit` method and Bell numbers. The search results contain several code spans from different files, including `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py`, `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`, and `sympy/core/expr.py`. However, the most relevant file seems to be `sympy/core/expr.py`, which contains the `Expr` class with a `limit` method. This method is the one that would be called when `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` is executed. Additionally, `sympy/series/limits.py` contains the `limit` function implementation, which may also be relevant for understanding how limits are computed in Sympy. The other files contain matrix-related code and additional utility functions that are not directly relevant to the Bell number limit issue. Therefore, the most important code spans are those from `sympy/core/expr.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py`.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
