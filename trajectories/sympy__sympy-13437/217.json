The issue suggests that the Bell numbers should be able to be evaluated at infinity, similar to the recent fixes for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. The code spans provided include the definition of the `limit` function, which is central to the problem, along with other functions and methods (such as `heuristics` and `Limit` class) that are involved in the limit computation process. This code is located in 'sympy/series/limits.py'. The `limit` function directly handles the computation of limits and uses other functions like `heuristics` and the `Limit` class to further process the limit. Thus, this code is highly relevant to the issue. The 'sympy/core/numbers.py' file also contains definitions for Infinity and Float, which are involved in the operation and representation of infinity in the context of the limit function. The spans `Limit`, `Limit.__new__`, `Limit.free_symbols`, and `Limit.doit` from 'sympy/series/limits.py', as well as `Infinity` and `Infinity.__new__` from 'sympy/core/numbers.py', are the most pertinent to the issue. These parts of the code deal directly with the implementation of the limit calculation and the handling of infinity within the SymPy system. The identified spans thoroughly cover the relevant parts of the code that are critical to understanding and potentially fixing the issue concerning the evaluation of Bell numbers at infinity.",

The goal is to modify the behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` to return `oo` instead of `bell(oo)` when `n` approaches infinity. This requires examining the `bell` function's definition and any associated methods, especially those related to evaluating limits. The `limit` function and its associated methods in `sympy/series/limits.py` should also be considered to see how they handle functions like `bell`.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
