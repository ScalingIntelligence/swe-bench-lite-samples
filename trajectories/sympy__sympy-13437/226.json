This suggests that the limit implementation for the `bell` function in SymPy is not handling the infinite limit case correctly. To address this, it's crucial to identify where and how the `bell` function is implemented and how its limits are currently being handled. From the search results, we find several relevant code spans:\n\n1. The `bell` class definition which includes methods for calculating Bell numbers (`_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`).\n2. The `eval` method in the `bell` class which determines the evaluation of Bell numbers based on the input.\n3. The `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` which is responsible for calculating limits, including potential handling of Bell numbers.\n4. The `Limit` class and its `doit` method in `sympy/series/limits.py` which are central to the limit computation.\n\nGiven the context, these spans are directly relevant to the issue as they involve the computation of Bell numbers and their limits. There's no need to delve further into other sections like the implementation of other combinatorial functions or unrelated limit handling logic.\n\nTo proceed with fixing the issue, one would need to modify the `limit` handling for the `bell` function, possibly within the `Limit.doit` method or by enhancing the `limit` function's understanding of the `bell` function's behavior at infinity.",

  "initial_message": "bell(n).limit(n, oo) should be oo rather than bell(oo)\n`bell(n).limit(n,oo)` should take the value infinity, but the current output is `bell(oo)`. As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
