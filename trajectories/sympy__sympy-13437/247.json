To address this, we need to identify parts of the code relevant to evaluating the limit of the Bell numbers as `n` approaches infinity. The `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` contains the definition and related methods for the Bell numbers. Specifically, the `bell.eval` method and the related recurrence methods for computing Bell numbers are relevant. Additionally, in `sympy/series/limits.py`, the `limit` function and the `Limit` class are key, as they handle the computation of limits, which is directly related to the reported issue. These sections of the code are crucial for understanding how the limit of `bell(n)` is currently evaluated and where modifications might need to be made to achieve the desired behavior.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
