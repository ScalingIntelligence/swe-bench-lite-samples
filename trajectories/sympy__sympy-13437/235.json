The current behavior is that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` returns `bell(oo)`, which is not the expected result of infinity. We should investigate the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and the `limit` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` or the underlying logic in `sympy/series/limits.py` that could be causing this unexpected output. Additionally, considering the similarity in the issue to the recent fixes for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, it might be beneficial to explore how the limit for these was corrected.",

This file contains the definition of the `bell` class and its methods, including `eval`, which determines how the function is evaluated. The file also includes methods for computing Bell numbers and Bell polynomials. Given that the issue involves the limit function, the `sympy/core/expr.py` file is also relevant, particularly the `limit` method in the `Expr` class. This method is responsible for calculating limits of expressions, which is directly relevant to the reported issue. The `sympy/series/limits.py` file, containing the `limit` function, is also relevant as it is the entry point for limit calculations in SymPy. Based on these observations, the most relevant code spans are those related to the `bell` function and the `limit` method.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
