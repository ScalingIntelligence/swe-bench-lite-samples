The expected output should be `oo` (infinity), but the current output is `bell(oo)`. This problem is similar to recent fixes in the corresponding limits for the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. To resolve this, we need to locate the specific implementation of the `limit` function in relation to combinatorial functions like `bell(n)`. Relevant files could include those handling combinatorial functions and limits, such as `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py`.",

This discrepancy needs to be addressed.\n\nReviewing the provided search results, the key sections of interest are within the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file, specifically the `bell` class and its associated methods.\n\nThe `bell` class contains several methods, including `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval`. These methods handle the computation and evaluation of Bell numbers, which are crucial for the reported issue. Additionally, the `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` method is relevant as it deals with the rewrite rules for Bell numbers.\n\nFurthermore, the `sympy/series/limits.py` file is relevant because it contains the `limit` function, which is used to compute limits in SymPy. The `Limit` class and its `doit` method are of particular interest, as they handle the actual computation of limits, which is directly related to the issue.\n\nGiven these observations, it is clear that the identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue. They provide the necessary context and code to analyze and potentially fix the problem where `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` does not return the expected result of infinity (`oo`).\n\nThus, the search task can be considered complete based on the provided search results.",

First, I examined the provided file context within `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` which contains the definition and implementation of the Bell numbers, including methods like `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, and `_bell_incomplete_poly`. I also reviewed `sympy/series/limits.py` which contains the logic for computing limits, including `limit` and `Limit.doit`, which are directly relevant to the issue. The search results reinforce these files' relevance as they contain similar code spans: in `sympy/series/limits.py`, I find the implementation of `limit` and the `doit` method of the `Limit` class, both of which could be involved in the calculation of the limit of the Bell numbers. Additionally, in `sympy/series/limitseq.py`, there are functions related to finding the dominant term and dealing with sequences, which could also be relevant.

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated.
