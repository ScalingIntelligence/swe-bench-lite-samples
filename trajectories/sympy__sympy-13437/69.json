Specifically, it states that bell(n).limit(n, oo) should return oo rather than bell(oo). This suggests that the function responsible for computing the limit of the bell function might need adjustments. Given this, the search results should be analyzed to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the limit computation for bell(n). The search results include several files and spans, but the most relevant seems to be the one in 'numbers.py' containing the definition of the bell class and its methods. Additionally, the 'Expr.limit' in 'expr.py' and the 'limit' function in 'limits.py' are also relevant as they deal with the limit computation in general. The 'MatrixCalculus.limit' seems less relevant as it pertains to matrices, not scalar functions like bell(n).\n\nBased on the analysis of the search results, the relevant code spans have been identified within the 'numbers.py' file for the bell class definition and its associated methods, which are likely responsible for the limit computation for bell numbers. Additionally, the 'Expr.limit' method from 'expr.py' and the 'limit' function from 'limits.py' have been identified as relevant since they involve the general computation of limits, which is pertinent to the reported issue.",

To address this, we should focus on the `limit` method in `Expr` and the `bell` function in `numbers.py`. From the search results, the relevant sections include the `limit` method in `Expr`, the `heuristics` function in `limits.py`, and the `bell` class in `numbers.py`. Particularly, the `bell._bell`, `bell._bell_poly`, `bell._bell_incomplete_poly`, and `bell.eval` spans in `numbers.py` are crucial as they define the behavior of the `bell` function. Additionally, the `Limit.doit` method in `limits.py` is important as it calls the `limit` evaluation.\n\nGiven the context, the `bell` class and its methods are directly related to the `bell` number functionality, which is central to the issue. The `limit` method in `Expr` and its interaction with `Limit.doit` are also key, as they handle the limit evaluation. The `heuristics` function might also be useful for understanding or implementing a custom limit behavior for `bell(n)`. Therefore, these sections of the code are pertinent to resolving the issue.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
