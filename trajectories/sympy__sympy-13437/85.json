The current output is incorrect, returning `bell(oo)` instead of `oo` when evaluating the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity. This suggests that the `bell` function and how it is handled in the limit evaluation process need to be examined. Relevant files include `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` (where the `bell` class is defined) and `sympy/series/limits.py` (where the `limit` function is implemented). Both files should be included in the search effort. Additionally, the behavior of the `Infinity` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py` might also play a role in the unexpected output.",

The task involves identifying the relevant code spans within the `bell` class and the `limit` function in the provided search results. The initial focus should be on the `bell.eval` method, which evaluates the Bell numbers, and the `limit` function, which handles the computation of limits. Given the current context is empty, the analysis starts fresh with the provided search results. The relevant spans include the definition and evaluation methods of the `bell` class, particularly `bell.eval` and `bell._eval_rewrite_as_Sum`, as well as the `limit` function from the limits module, which includes heuristic evaluations. According to the issue, the Bell number's limit should evaluate to infinity, suggesting that adjustments might need to be made to the limit computation within the provided code spans. Specifically, the `bell.eval` method should be examined to ensure it correctly handles the infinity case, and the `limit` function's heuristics should be reviewed for any adjustments needed to correctly compute this limit. This includes examining the handling of specific cases within the `eval` method and ensuring that the limit function appropriately integrates with these cases.",

Analysing the new search results, the limit function and its various components are present, which confirms their relevance to the issue. Specifically, the `limit` function, `Limit.doit` method, and `heuristics` function are the most relevant for addressing the issue. 4. The `Limit.doit` method contains logic for handling different types of expressions and their limits, which is directly related to the scenario described in the issue. 5. The 'heuristics' function attempts to handle special cases and simplify expressions before evaluating their limits, making it another relevant part of the solution. 6.
