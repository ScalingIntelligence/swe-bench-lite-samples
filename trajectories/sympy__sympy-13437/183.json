This suggests that the `bell` function and its associated limit handling are located in the `sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers` module. Additionally, the `limit` function and its handling of infinity should be investigated in the `sympy.series.limits` module. Also, checking the core implementation of infinity in `sympy.core.numbers` might be relevant to understand how infinity is being handled in these contexts.",

To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that deal with the Bell numbers and their limits. The search results provide several potential candidates:\n\n1. **sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py**:\n   - **span id='bell'**: This span contains the definition of the `bell` class, which is likely related to Bell numbers. This is a critical span as it directly deals with the definition of the Bell numbers.\n   - **span id='nT'**: This span contains the definition of the `nT` function which includes calls to `bell(N)` when `k` is `None`. This suggests a connection between `nT` and Bell numbers.\n\n2. **sympy/core/expr.py**:\n   - **span id='Expr.limit'**: This span contains the implementation of the `limit` method for the `Expr` class, which is inherited by various classes including `bell`. This is relevant as it is related to the limit calculation.\n\n3. **sympy/series/limits.py**:\n   - **span id='limit'**: This span contains the definition of the `limit` function which performs the actual limit computation.\n\nThese spans together provide the necessary context to understand the definition of Bell numbers and how their limits are currently handled.

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
