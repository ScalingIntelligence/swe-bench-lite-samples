The `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` is also relevant as it is the primary function used to compute limits in Sympy, including the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity. Identifying these spans is crucial to understanding and fixing the issue where `bell(oo)` is returned instead of `oo`.

The function specifically rewrites the input expression using rewriting rules for specific functions like fibonacci and RisingFactorial, indicating that these functions have specific behaviors at limits. The bell function, despite its absence in the limit function's special treatment, can likely benefit from similar handling. As such, understanding how special functions like fibonacci are managed in the limit function could inform the appropriate changes needed for the bell function. Additionally, the bell function's current behavior in evaluating limits (returning bell(oo) instead of oo) suggests a specific evaluation method missing in its definition or limit handling.

This discrepancy arises because the current implementation of the `bell` function and its `eval` method do not handle the case where `n` approaches infinity. To resolve this issue, it would be necessary to update the `eval` method in the `bell` class to accommodate the behavior of the Bell numbers as `n` approaches infinity. This involves understanding that as the number of partitions of a set increases indefinitely, the Bell numbers grow without bound, making `bell(oo)` effectively equal to infinity. The search results provided do not contain any additional code spans that directly handle the limit behavior of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity. Therefore, based on the current context and search results, it is essential to focus on modifying the `bell.eval` method to include the case where `n` is `S.Infinity` and return `S.Infinity` in such scenarios, following the pattern established in the `fibonacci.eval` method. This approach aligns with the recent fixes made to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.",
