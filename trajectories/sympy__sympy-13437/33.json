Given the information, the `bell` function is defined in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, and the `limit` function is likely to be in `sympy/series/limits.py` or related files.

This indicates a discrepancy in the handling of infinity in the context of Bell numbers. To address this, it is essential to examine the `bell` class and its associated methods within the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file. The key spans to look at are `bell.eval`, `bell._bell`, `bell._bell_poly`, and `bell._bell_incomplete_poly`, as these methods define the behavior of the bell function and might contain the logic for handling the limit as `n` approaches infinity. Additionally, the `limitinf` function in `sympy/series/gruntz.py` might be relevant as it pertains to handling limits at infinity, though it does not directly reference the bell function. The analysis shows that while `bell.eval` handles integer evaluations, it might lack explicit handling for the limit when `n` approaches infinity. Therefore, the identified spans from `numbers.py` are relevant for attempting to fix this issue.",

The problem is that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` should return `oo` but currently returns `bell(oo)`. Here are my observations:\n\n1. The `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` has methods for calculating Bell numbers: `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and its `eval` method.\n2. The `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` contains heuristics and implementations for determining limits. It looks at trends across the codebase, and Bell numbers seem to be fundamentally similar to Fibonacci and Lucas numbers that have been fixed recently.\n3. The `gruntz` function in `sympy/series/gruntz.py` is key to the computations toward limits using the Max-Repeated-Variable (MRV) set, including signs, omega (this is not stated in the instruction but derived). It seems that the part returning for the MRV set in this context or its implementation for Bell would need to reflect the infinite behaviors as the variable n grows unboundedly large according to the problem statement.\n\nGiven these insights, the relevant code spans to be updated or investigated further are:\n\n- **sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers**\n  - **Function**: `bell._bell` and `bell.eval`\n- **sympy.series.limits**\n  - **Function**: `limit`. Its logic should adequately handle infinity (oo) for Bell numbers. The provided spans are under the assumption that the function in question are adequate but do not directly address the specific requisite for interpreting towards decision bounds of infinity unlike the Fibonacci or Lucas modules relevant with corrections.\n- **sympy.series.gruntz**\n  - **Function**: `gruntz`, with focus on the exponent section and correct handling of fibonacci and other similar algorithm-design aspects for polynomials, rational and infinite implications involved in series expansion towards limit determination for bell.\n\nApproaching carefully, these areas appear crucial: the Bell functions and the eval methods especially in the context of number theory related correctness and the MRV-driven algorithms maintained within the gruntz.py for implications of structural integrity of limiting behaviors including to ensure adaptation or amend the mathematical logic that need to recognize Bell outright arising from similar fixes witnessed in the base cases of other sequences control (i.e., Fibonacci, Lucas) for the revealed edge cases fixed if any were relevant from choices available.",

Therefore, the focus must shift to the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, where the general handling of limits is defined. This file contains the `Limit` class and the `doit` method, which is responsible for computing the limit, but no specific handling for `bell(n)` when `n` is `S.Infinity` is readily visible. Since there's no immediate indication of how `bell(n)` is integrated into the limit handling, the search should now focus on understanding how the general `limit` function processes functions like `bell`, especially in situations involving infinity. Relevant files in this exploration could be `sympy/series/gruntz.py`, where more detailed numerical or analytical methods for computing limits might be implemented, and possibly also cross-referencing with `sympy/core/numbers.py` to understand the management and representations of infinity (`oo`) within SymPy.",

To identify the relevant code spans, we need to focus on functions and classes related to the Bell numbers and their limits. From the provided context, we have seen that 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py' contains the definition of the `bell` class and its methods such as `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval`. Additionally, in 'sympy/series/limits.py', there is a `Limit` class with a `doit` method which handles the calculation of limits. The new search results provide additional context in 'sympy/series/gruntz.py', particularly the `limitinf` function which is crucial for calculating limits as `oo` (infinity). This function is also related to the `gruntz` method used in the `Limit` class's `doit` method. The `Infinity` class in 'sympy/core/numbers.py' represents the concept of infinity which is relevant to understanding the expected behavior of the limit. Overall, the relevant code spans involve the `bell` class methods in 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py', the `Limit` and `limitinf` functions in 'sympy/series/limits.py' and 'sympy/series/gruntz.py', and the `Infinity` class in 'sympy/core/numbers.py'.",

However, there is no explicit handling of the limit for `bell(n)` when `n` approaches infinity within the provided context of the `bell` class. The provided `eval` method for `bell` does not handle the scenario where `n` is `S.Infinity`. Therefore, the focus must shift to the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, where the general handling of limits is defined. This file contains the `Limit` class and the `doit` method, which is responsible for computing the limit, but no specific handling for `bell(n)` when `n` is `S.Infinity` is readily visible. Since there's no immediate indication of how `bell(n)` is integrated into the limit handling, the search should now focus on understanding how the general `limit` function processes functions like `bell`, especially in situations involving infinity. Relevant files in this exploration could be `sympy/series/gruntz.py`, where more detailed numerical or analytical methods for computing limits might be implemented, and possibly also cross-referencing with `sympy/core/numbers.py` to understand the management and representations of infinity (`oo`) within SymPy.",
