The key is to identify the section of the code where the limit function and the Bell numbers (bell) are handled. From the search results, the relevant sections are found in two files: 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py' and 'sympy/series/limits.py'.\n\nIn 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py', the class `bell` and its methods like `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval` are found. These methods define how the Bell numbers are computed and evaluated, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of `bell(n)` as `n` grows.\n\nIn 'sympy/series/limits.py', the `limit` function is defined, which is responsible for computing limits of expressions. This function is the one that needs to be examined and potentially adjusted to ensure that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` returns `oo` (infinity) rather than `bell(oo)`.\n\nSince the issue specifies a behavioral change in the limit function for Bell numbers similar to previous fixes for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, the necessary code spans are the `bell` class and its evaluation methods in 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py', along with the `limit` function in 'sympy/series/limits.py'. These spans will provide the context needed to correctly implement or adjust the limit evaluation for Bell numbers.",

In the provided file context, we can see the implementation of the `bell` class and the `limit` function. The `bell` class has methods for calculating Bell numbers, but there's no direct indication of how the limit function interacts with these methods. The `limit` function uses heuristics and gruntz algorithm to evaluate limits.

The issue involves understanding the Bell numbers and their limit behavior at infinity. The relevant code spans in the search results are within `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py`. In `numbers.py`, the `bell` class definition, particularly the `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval` methods, are relevant as they deal with the evaluation and representation of Bell numbers. Additionally, in `limits.py`, the `limit`, `Limit.doit`, and `heuristics` functions are pertinent as they oversee the computation of limits, which is crucial for addressing the issue. Reviewing these code spans and their interactions will provide the necessary context to potentially fix the bug and ensure `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` returns `oo` as expected.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
