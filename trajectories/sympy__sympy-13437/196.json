The key steps involve identifying where the limit function is defined and how it handles the Bell number function. Additionally, we need to look at how the Bell number function itself is implemented to understand its behavior in the context of limits.\n\n1. Analyzing the `sympy/series/limits.py` file, we see that the `limit` function is defined here, along with the `Limit` class and its `doit` method. This section of the code handles the general logic for computing limits of expressions.\n\n2. In the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file, we find the implementation of the `bell` function. This includes the `bell._bell`, `bell._bell_poly`, and `bell._bell_incomplete_poly` methods, which compute the Bell numbers and their associated polynomials. The `bell.eval` method evaluates the Bell numbers.\n\nCombining this information, the relevant code spans are those that define the `limit` function and handle general limit computation, as well as those that define the `bell` function itself. The `limit` function's handling of the `bell` function within the `heuristics` method and the `Limit.doit` method is particularly relevant, as these are involved in the computation of the limit for the Bell numbers. The implementation of the `bell` function, including its evaluation and polynomial computations, is also important for understanding how `bell(n)` behaves as `n` approaches infinity.\n\nThese identified code spans provide a comprehensive view of the areas that are likely involved in resolving the reported issue concerning the limit of the Bell function as `n` approaches infinity.",

The initial context provided includes code spans from `sympy/series/limits.py` that are relevant to the limit calculation process, particularly the `limit` function, heuristics, and the `Limit` class with its `doit` method. These parts of the code are crucial as they determine the behavior of limit calculation. The search results also contain additional spans from `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` that detail the implementation of the `bell` function, including its recursive calculation and polynomial representation. This file is also relevant as it defines the behavior of the Bell numbers themselves. Given the nature of the issue, the key task is to identify where and how the limit calculation for the Bell numbers (i.e., `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`) is being handled and ensure that it correctly evaluates to infinity rather than returning `bell(oo)` unevaluated. The search results provided do contain relevant code spans that could potentially be involved in fixing the issue, particularly the spans related to the `bell` class and the `limit` function's handling of infinite limits.",

The expected output is `oo` (infinity), but the current implementation returns `bell(oo)`, which is not evaluated. To address this, we need to identify the relevant sections of code responsible for handling limits and the Bell function. The following steps guide the identification process:\n1. **Analyze User Instructions**: The issue involves the definition and behavior of the Bell function when the limit of `n` approaches infinity.\n2. **Review Current Context**: In `sympy/series/limits.py`, there is a specific handling for `fibonacci` with rewrites to `GoldenRatio`. This similarity suggests that the same approach can be explored for `bell`.\n3. **Process New Search Results**:\n   - **sympy/series/limits.py**:\n      - **imports** and **heuristics**: These spans import necessary modules and define heuristics for limit calculations.\n      - **limit** and **Limit.doit**: Functions to calculate limits and their implementation.\n   - **sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py**:\n      - **bell**: Definition of the Bell function and its properties to compute the Bell numbers and polynomials.\n      - **bell.eval**: Method to evaluate the Bell function for integer `n`.\n\nFrom these sections, it is evident that the `eval` method for `bell` is crucial as it should handle the case when `n` is infinity. By examining the `heuristics` and `Limit.doit` functions, we can broaden our understanding of how to reimplement or augment these functionalities to support the expected behavior for the Bell function.\n\nThe identified spans are consistent with the issue's requirements and should be adequate for fixing the `bell(n).limit(n,oo)` behavior.",
