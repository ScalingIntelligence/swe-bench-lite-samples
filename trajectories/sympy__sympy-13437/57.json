This indicates a problem with how the limit is being computed for the Bell numbers function. To address this, I looked at the `bell` class definition in `numbers.py` and found several relevant methods such as `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, and `eval`. These functions are central to how Bell numbers are computed and might need adjustments to handle the limit correctly. I also examined `limits.py` where the `limit` function and its associated heuristics are defined. This module handles how limits across the SymPy library are computed and could be the place where a fix is needed to correctly compute the limit for functions like `bell` when tending to infinity.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
