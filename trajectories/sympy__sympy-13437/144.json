This involves understanding the Bell numbers' representation of partitions of a set and ensuring that an infinite limit correctly evaluates to infinity rather than returning the function unevaluated. From the search results, the relevant code spans include the definition and evaluation of the Bell numbers in `numbers.py`, particularly the `bell` class and its static methods for computing Bell numbers and polynomials (`_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`). Additionally, understanding how limits are computed in `limits.py` is crucial, as this is where the specific limit scenario (`limit(e, z, z0, dir=\"+\")`) is defined and executed. The `numbers.py` code provides the foundation for understanding and potentially modifying how Bell numbers are handled at infinity, while the `limits.py` code shows the general approach to computing limits in SymPy. These sections lay the groundwork for addressing the issue by either modifying how Bell numbers are evaluated at infinity directly within the `bell` class or by adjusting the limit computation logic in `limits.py` to handle Bell numbers appropriately.",

The `bell` class uses recurrence relations to compute Bell numbers, and there's a method named `eval` that could be relevant for this issue, though it does not currently handle the case where `n` is `S.Infinity`. In the `Limit` class, the `doit` method is responsible for computing the limit, which could involve modifying how `bell(oo)` is handled.

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
