To fix this, we need to identify where the limit calculation for 'bell' is handled and ensure it correctly evaluates to 'oo'. The files provided suggest that the 'bell' function is defined in 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py', and the limit handling is likely in 'sympy/series/limits.py' or 'sympy/series/gruntz.py'. We should focus the search on these files and related logic handling limits and Bell numbers.",

The 'bell' function is part of the combinatorial functions in 'numbers.py', where it's defined without direct special handling for limits. In 'limits.py', the primary method for computing limits is 'limit', which manages different scenarios for symbol being finite, positive infinity, or negative infinity, delegating complex cases to 'gruntz' or 'heuristics'. The Gruntz algorithm, implemented in 'gruntz.py', is specifically designed for evaluating limits at infinity ('limitinf'). Noting that 'bell' does not have its peculiar limit handling indicated in the code provided, it seems likely that its limit as n tends to infinity ('bell(oo)') is being passed through standard limit functions without special rules. Thus, focusing on either enhancing the 'heuristics' method or adjusting the behavior within 'gruntz' function could potentially resolve the issue of the desired behavior of the limit of 'bell(n)' as n approaches infinity incorrectly returning 'bell(oo)' rather than 'oo'.

Particularly relevant are the `Limit.doit` method, which handles the evaluation of limits, and the `gruntz` function, which is an essential algorithm for computing limits, especially when evaluated at infinity.\n\nThe `gruntz` function includes a call to `limitinf`, which is likely where the limit computation for `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity is determined. It is noted that the current behavior returns `bell(oo)` rather than `oo`, indicating a potential issue in the handling of limits for combinatorial functions like Bell numbers.\n\nBased on the analysis, the relevant spans to address the issue are those that handle the limit computation at infinity, particularly focusing on the `Limit.doit` and `gruntz` functions.",
