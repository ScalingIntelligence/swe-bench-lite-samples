To address this, we need to identify the relevant parts of the code where the bell(n) function and the limit function are defined and interact. The search results show several relevant sections of the codebase. We need to focus on the bell class definition, its eval method, and the limit method in the Expr class. The bell class definition includes static methods _bell, _bell_poly, and _bell_incomplete_poly, which are relevant for the evaluation of Bell numbers. The Expr class includes a limit method that delegates to sympy.series.limits.limit, which is also relevant for understanding how limits are computed in Sympy. Additionally, the MatrixCalculus class includes a limit method, but this appears to be related to matrices and not directly relevant to the issue at hand.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
