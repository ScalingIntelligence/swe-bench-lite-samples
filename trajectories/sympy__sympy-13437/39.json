Additionally, the interaction of the 'limit' function with the 'bell' function and 'Infinity' in 'expr.py' and 'limits.py' was observed. Specifically, the 'limit' method in 'expr.py' directs to the 'limit' function in 'limits.py'. Moreover, 'Infinity' handling is relevant, specifically defined in 'sympy/core/numbers.py'. The initial analysis leads to the conclusion that the 'limit' function passes control to the 'gruntz' method, which handles complex limits and does not directly assign a value to the limit of Bell numbers as required. Therefore, the issue persists because the 'limit' functionality does not appropriately handle the case of Bell numbers explicitly. This suggests that an enhancement will be needed in the 'limit' function handling code to adequately address this case and to yield the expected behavior, which should return 'oo' (infinity).",
