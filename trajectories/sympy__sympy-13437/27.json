The key methods to examine are `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval` within the `bell` class. Additionally, the `limit` function and its related methods in `sympy/series/limits.py` need to be inspected to understand how limits are currently computed and how the `bell` function interacts with it. The provided code spans include the necessary functionalities and logic to determine the current behavior and potential points of modification to achieve the desired output where `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` returns infinity. Therefore, identifying these spans is essential for understanding the codebase's handling of Bell numbers in limits and for potential fixes.",

Furthermore, the context includes the limit function from the limits.py file, which shows general limit calculation but does not explicitly handle bell numbers. Reviewing the recent fixes for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers in the repository is crucial to understand how their limits were managed as they approach infinity, potentially providing a template or insight into how to handle the bell(n).limit(n, oo) issue.

This approach could serve as a template for addressing the bell(n).limit(n, oo) issue. Additionally, the limits.py file provides a general framework for handling limits, including the use of the gruntz algorithm and specific heuristics for expressions involving sums, products, powers, and functions. The heuristics function handles special cases and could potentially be adapted for the bell numbers if their behavior diverges from the general algorithm's assumptions. Further investigation into the implementation of the bell class and its integration with the limit function may reveal the necessary adjustments to ensure bell(n).limit(n, oo) returns the expected result of S.Infinity instead of bell(oo).",

The relevant parts of the code to address this issue are in the implementation of the `bell` function and its handling in the `limit` function. Specifically, we need to check how the `bell` function evaluates for `n.is_Infinity` and how the `limit` function processes it.\n\n1. In `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, there is a class `bell` with a method `eval`. This is where the evaluation of `bell(n)` happens. We need to ensure that when `n` is `S.Infinity`, the function correctly returns `S.Infinity` instead of `bell(S.Infinity)`.\n\n2. In `sympy/series/limits.py`, the `limit` function and its subsidiary functions like `heuristics` handle the computation of limits. We should inspect how these functions process the `bell` function and ensure they correctly interpret `bell(oo)` as `oo`.\n\nFrom the current context and search results, the relevant spans are those dealing directly with the `bell` function's evaluation and how it interfaces with the `limit` computation. These are found under `bell.eval` in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and in the `heuristics` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`.

However, the bell class does not currently have a similar handling of infinite limits.
