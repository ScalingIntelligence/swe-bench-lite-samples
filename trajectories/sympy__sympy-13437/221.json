To address this, it's necessary to find the relevant code spans that handle the limit calculations for the Bell numbers function and understand how the limit is currently computed. The search results provided contain multiple spans from two files: 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py' and 'sympy/series/limits.py'. The key spans to focus on are those within the 'bell' class definition in numbers.py, particularly the '_bell', '_bell_poly', '_bell_incomplete_poly', and 'eval' methods as they directly deal with the computation of Bell numbers. Additionally, in limits.py, the 'limit' function and heuristics are relevant as they deal with the limit computations for symbolic expressions, including those involving functions like Bell numbers. These spans provide a comprehensive view of how the Bell numbers are computed and how limits are calculated in SymPy, providing the necessary context to identify the issue and implement a fix. Specifically, the 'eval' method in the 'bell' class needs to be inspected to ensure that when n approaches infinity, the output is properly handled to return 'oo'. Furthermore, the 'limit' function and heuristics in limits.py should be reviewed to ensure they correctly handle the limit of functions when the argument approaches infinity.",

The `bell` function is defined in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and the `limit` function is defined in `sympy/series/limits.py`. The current context includes the definition of the `bell` function and its various methods like `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval`, as well as the `limit` function and its methods `doit`, `heuristics`, and `limit`. The new search results confirm the presence of these functions and their methods.

The provided file context includes the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, which defines the Bell numbers but lacks specific handling for the limit as 'n' approaches infinity. Additionally, the `limit` function and related heuristics in `sympy/series/limits.py` are responsible for computing limits but do not have specific handling for combinatorial functions like Bell numbers. Given these observations, it appears that while the relevant classes and functions for Bell numbers and limit computations are identified, specific methods or code to address the limit issue for Bell numbers are not yet implemented. Further investigation in these areas and potential new methods for handling this specific case may be necessary to fully resolve the issue.",
