To address this, we need to identify the relevant code that handles the limit of the Bell numbers. From the search results, the most relevant file is `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, specifically the `bell` function. This is because the issue is directly related to the Bell numbers function, and the search results provide the implementation of the `bell` function and other related functions. The next relevant file is `sympy/core/expr.py`, which contains the `Expr.limit` method, indicating how expressions in Sympy handle limits. This is important because the issue involves the limit operation. The `Limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` is also relevant as it is responsible for calculating the limit, which is the operation being critiqued in the issue report. The other files, such as `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py` and `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`, do not directly relate to the Bell numbers or the limit operation being discussed.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
