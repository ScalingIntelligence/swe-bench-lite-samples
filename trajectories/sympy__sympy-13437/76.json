The reported issue indicates that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` should return infinity instead of `bell(oo)`. This suggests that there might be an issue in how the `bell` function handles large values of `n` when it is being used within the `limit` function. The search results provide several relevant code spans: 1. The `bell` class and its methods defined in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, particularly `bell._bell`, `bell._bell_poly`, `bell._bell_incomplete_poly`, and `bell.eval`. These methods are crucial for understanding how the Bell numbers are computed. 2. The `limit` function and related heuristics in `sympy/series/limits.py`. This includes the `limit` function itself and the `Limit.doit` method, which is responsible for computing the limit. By analyzing these sections, we can identify where the `bell` function is being used within the context of `limit` and understand if there's a misalignment in handling large values of `n`. Based on the analysis, the relevant code spans are those that deal with the evaluation and computation of the Bell numbers and their limits.",

The `limit` function uses heuristics and the gruntz algorithm to compute limits, including those of combinatorial functions like the Bell numbers. However, the specific issue of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` not evaluating to `oo` is not directly addressed in the provided context.

The task involves identifying the relevant code spans in the search results that pertain to the Bell number function (`bell`) and the limit function (`limit`) to understand how the limit is being calculated. This will help in determining where the fix for the issue should be applied. The search results include the definition of the `bell` class, its internal methods and the limit function's handling. During the analysis, it becomes evident that the Bell numbers' internal computations are not directly affecting the limit evaluation in a way that would result in infinity for n approaching infinity. This suggests a need to modify the limit function or the evaluation logic for the Bell numbers. The relevant code spans include the `bell.eval` method and the `Limit.doit` method which handles the evaluation of limits. These sections could be modified or extended to properly recognize when the limit of the Bell numbers should be infinity.",

This indicates a gap in the `eval` method of the `bell` class, where the limit processing might not be adequately handled for infinite inputs. The search results provide insights into the `limit` function and the `gruntz` algorithm, which are crucial for understanding how the limit of a function is computed in the context of Sympy. The `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` processes the limit using heuristics and the `gruntz` method. The `bell.eval` method should be updated to handle the specific case where `n` approaches infinity, ensuring that it returns `S.Infinity` instead of `bell(oo)`. This requires understanding how the `eval` method of `bell` works and how the limit is currently processed, which can guide the necessary adjustments for resolving this issue. The identified relevant code spans primarily include the `limit` and `Limit` class definitions, as well as the `gruntz` function, which is key for performing the actual limit computation.",

There's an immediate indication that the current implementation of `bell` does not handle the case when `n` is `S.Infinity`, as done in the `fibonacci` class in the same file. This suggests that the logic to handle the Bell numbers' limit as `n` approaches infinity is missing in the `bell` function. Additionally, in sympy/series/limits.py, the `limit` function reroutes to the `grunzt` algorithm, which is also provided in the file context, but upon examining sympy/series/gruntz.py, there is a direct call to `limitinf` function without any explicit case handling for combinatorial functions like `bell`. Therefore, while the necessary aspects for evaluating limits, including the `gruntz` algorithm, are present, specific handling and possibly modifications for combinatorial functions like `bell(n)` are not evident. Additional scrutiny of how `gruntz` handles complex expressions might reveal necessary modifications for combinatorial functions, but current file context does not provide direct indications for such enhancements.",
