The Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, and the expected behavior aligns with the fixes made for the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. Given the issue and the provided files, the focus should be on the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`. These are likely where the fix would be applied. Additionally, reviewing how `__eval__` and `__eval_rewrite__` methods on `bell` can help define a transformation as n approaches infinity should be considered, possibly set up to mimic the same relationship seen with numbers like fibonacci as noted in the issue at hand.",

This suggests that the limit function for the `bell` class or method needs to be adjusted. The relevant code spans should be identified where the `bell` class and its `limit` method are defined or used. In the search results, the `bell` class is found in 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py', but there is no explicit `limit` method for `bell` in that file. Instead, the `limit` method appears in 'sympy/core/expr.py' defined for the `Expr` class, which `bell` might inherit. Additionally, there is a `limit` method defined for `MatrixCalculus` in 'sympy/matrices/matrices.py', but this context seems irrelevant as it pertains to matrix calculus. The core focus should be on the 'numbers.py' file defining `bell` and 'expr.py' defining the default `Expr.limit`.",

  "initial_message": "bell(n).limit(n, oo) should be oo rather than bell(oo)\n`bell(n).limit(n,oo)` should take the value infinity, but the current output is `bell(oo)`. As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
