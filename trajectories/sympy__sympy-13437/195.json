This suggests an issue with how the limit function is handled in the context of the Bell numbers. The analysis of the provided search results reveals several key components:\n\n1. **sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py** - This file contains the definition of the `bell` class and its associated methods. Notably, it includes `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval` methods, which operate on Bell numbers. However, the file does not directly address the limit operation on Bell numbers.\n\n2. **sympy/series/limits.py** - This file contains the limits module, including the `limit` function and its implementation. It handles the computation of limits for various expressions and includes cases for handling `S.Infinity`. This is the core functionality where the behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` should be addressed.\n\nBased on the reported issue, the focus should be on modifying the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` to correctly handle the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity. The provided context does not currently contain specific code spans that directly address this issue. Therefore, further investigation or modification in `sympy/series/limits.py` is necessary.\n\nGiven these observations, it is crucial to begin by exploring the `limit` function and its interactions with the `bell` class. Additionally, considering the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers might provide insights into how to approach fixing the issue for Bell numbers.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
