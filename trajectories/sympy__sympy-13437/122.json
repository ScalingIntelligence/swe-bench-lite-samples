This suggests a problem in how the limit is being evaluated for the Bell numbers. Relevant files and functions include the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, and possibly the `Infinity` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`. Additionally, the `limitinf` function in `sympy/series/gruntz.py` might be involved in the calculation of the limit. To identify the exact part of the code responsible for this issue, a targeted search should be performed in these files and functions.",

        "message": "The search returned 15 results. But unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find any of the search results relevant to the query.\n\nTo address the reported issue where `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` should evaluate to infinity rather than `bell(oo)`, it is necessary to look into the implementation of the `bell` class and the limit handling in Sympy. The provided search results include various aspects of the `bell` function and the `limit` function, but they do not directly show the integration between these two functionalities. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **bell class and its methods**: We have the `bell` class definition followed by methods such as `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval`. These methods handle computations for the Bell numbers and their associated polynomials. We also see the method `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum`, which hints at how the Bell number might be represented using a sum.\n\n2. **limit function**: The `limit` function is defined in `sympy/series/limits.py` and uses the `Limit` class's `doit` method to evaluate the limit. The `limits.py` file does not show a direct connection to the `numbers.py` file or the `bell` class.\n\n3. **integrating bell and limit**: Given the issue, we need to find where the limit evaluation integration happens for the `bell` function because the problem arises during the limit computation of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity.\n\nFrom the analysis, I would suggest looking further into the `limit` handling mechanism in the `bell` function or the integration of the `limit` function with functions in `sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers`, which is where `bell` is defined. The provided code spans do not directly address the limit evaluation issue with the `bell` function.",

Since the `bell` class is defined in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and the limit function is handled in `sympy/series/limits.py`, the focus should be on code spans that involve both the `bell` class and the limit computation, particularly where `bell(n)` is being evaluated as `n` approaches infinity.
