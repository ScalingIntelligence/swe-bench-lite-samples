To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the limit calculation for the Bell numbers. In the provided search results, the following are potential candidates for relevance:\n\n1. `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` contains the `bell` class definition, which is directly related to the Bell numbers. The `nT` function also interacts with the Bell numbers, potentially indicating where the limit calculation for Bell numbers might occur.\n\n2. `sympy/series/limits.py` includes the `limit` function and its associated heuristics, which are central to the limit calculation. Specifically, the `limit` function is responsible for computing limits, including those involving symbolic expressions like `bell(n)`.\n\nGiven these observations, the relevant code spans are likely those within the `bell` class and the `limit` function within `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and `sympy/series/limits.py`, respectively. These spans provide the context and functionality necessary to address the reported issue regarding the limit of Bell numbers.\n\nSince the issue involves fixing the limit behavior for `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity, focusing on these code spans will likely lead to the identification of where the current logic allowing `bell(oo)` instead of infinity needs correction. This approach aligns with the goal of understanding and addressing the bug, potentially enabling the reported issue to be fixed.",

To resolve this, we need to identify the relevant code spans that handle the limit calculation for the Bell numbers. There are several key parts in the provided search results that might be relevant:\n\n1. The `bell` function and its associated methods in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`.\n2. The `limit` function and its associated methods in `sympy/series/limits.py`.\n3. The `gruntz` function and its associated methods in `sympy/series/gruntz.py`.\n\nBy analyzing the provided spans, we can identify the specific parts of the code that are responsible for the limit calculations and the Bell number functions. Here's a detailed breakdown of the relevant spans:\n\n- In `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, the spans 'bell', 'bell._bell', 'bell._bell_poly', and 'bell._bell_incomplete_poly' are relevant as they define the Bell number functions and their properties.\n- In `sympy/series/limits.py`, the spans 'limit', 'Limit', and 'Limit.doit' are relevant as they handle the limit calculations.\n- In `sympy/series/gruntz.py`, the spans 'gruntz', 'limitinf', and 'mrv_leadterm' are relevant as they are part of the algorithm used to compute limits.\n\nThese spans are likely to contain the necessary code to address the reported issue by modifying the limit calculation for the Bell numbers.",

Given the issue, it's crucial to delve deeper into how combinatorial functions like `bell` are managed in the context of limits. The `limits.py` file shows a function `limit` which delegates to `gruntz` for complex limit evaluations, indicating that `gruntz.py` would be a key file to inspect for understanding how limits are computed generally in SymPy. Additionally, the `bell` function might have specific handling or special cases in its definition or related helper functions that could affect limit evaluation.

However, the specific handling of the limit behavior as `n` approaches infinity is not addressed within this file. The limit function is defined in sympy.series.limits.py, which utilizes the gruntz function in sympy.series.gruntz.py for complex limit evaluations. This indicates that the gruntz module, not the numbers.py file, contains the logic for handling limits. Additionally, there's no direct mention of limiting behavior for combinatorial functions like bell when `n` approaches infinity within the file context provided. Therefore, while the context provides useful information about the bell function and its computation, it does not contain the code concerning the limit behavior as `n` approaches infinity.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
