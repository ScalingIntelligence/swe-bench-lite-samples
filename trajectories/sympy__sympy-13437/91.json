From the search results: Firstly in 'numbers.py', the `bell` class has several important spans: The `_bell` span provides the recurrence relation for calculating Bell numbers directly, while `_bell_poly` and `_bell_incomplete_poly` handle Bell polynomials and incomplete Bell polynomials respectively. The `eval` method in `bell` class is crucial as it evaluates the Bell numbers and polynomials. It's a likely candidate for implementing or moving the logic to handle the limit. Secondly, in 'limits.py', the `limit` function is general and may not directly impact this specific issue but could be used as a reference for how limit calculation works. Lastly, in 'gruntz.py', the `limitinf` function provides an in-depth view of how SymPy calculates limits at infinity, which could be useful for understanding the current problem and for possibly implementing a fix to handle the limit of the Bell function correctly.",

This issue can be traced to the `bell` class in the codebase. The `bell` class has methods like `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval`, which are essential for understanding the behavior of the `bell` function, especially with respect to its limits. The current implementation of `bell` does not seem to handle the limit case explicitly, which could be a potential cause of this issue.\n\nIn the search results, we have the `limits.py` and `gruntz.py` files which contain methods related to calculating limits, including `limit`, `heuristics`, `Limit.doit`, and `gruntz`. These functions are crucial for evaluating the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity. The `gruntz` function in `gruntz.py` is the principal algorithm used in SymPy for limit computations, and it should be reviewed or possibly updated to handle the `bell(n)` case correctly.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify or extend the `grass` function to correctly handle the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity, ensuring that it evaluates to `oo` (infinity) rather than `bell(oo)`.",
