This discrepancy is similar to the recent fixes for the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. To address this, the focus should be on the `bell` class and its interaction with the `limit` function. The goal is to determine how the limit calculation is currently being handled and how it can be adjusted to return `oo` for the Bell numbers. The relevant files initially identified are `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` for the `bell` class implementation, and `sympy/series/limits.py` for the `limit` function implementation. Additional relevant files might include those where series expansion and limits are evaluated.",

            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about `bell(n).limit(n,oo)` not evaluating to `oo` as expected but instead returning `bell(oo)`. The key steps are to identify the relevant code spans in the provided search results and assess whether the task is complete.\n\n1. Analyzing the initial issue: The issue specifies that `bell(n).limit(n,oo)` should yield `oo` rather than `bell(oo)`. This suggests that the limitation lies in how the Bell numbers are handled when `n` approaches infinity.\n\n2. Reviewing the current context: There are no previous identified files or code spans applicable to this issue.\n\n3. Processing new search results:\n  - In `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, several code spans are identified related to the `bell` function and its methods (`bell._bell`, `bell._bell_poly`, `bell._bell_incomplete_poly`, and `bell.eval`). These methods define the behavior and evaluation of Bell numbers.\n  - Additionally, there's a new function `nT` which interacts directly with Bell numbers and combinatorial operations.\n  - In `sympy/series/limits.py`, sections tagged with `imports` and `limit` are relevant as they deal with the limit function and possible heuristics for evaluating limits.\n  - The `heuristics` section suggests how different mathematical operations should be processed when evaluating limits.\n  - The `Limit` class and its `doit` method which is central to limit computations are also present.\n\nEvaluating the relevance and completeness of these spans: Given the context and the issue, it appears that the `bell.eval` method and associated internal methods (`_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`) are most pertinent to address the issue of Bell numbers when `n` approaches infinity. The `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` will be also crucial in investigating how Bell number limits are computed. This inclusive investigation across related files and functions provides a more holistic view of potential areas for code improvement.\n\nHowever, the immediate search may require expanding further on the entirety of code sections related to Bell functions and limit definitions but initial spans are revealing to provide a clearer path in understanding the eventual core of the problem and formulating necessary adjustments in Sympy.",

The correct output should be infinity (oo) rather than the unevaluated form bell(oo). This issue shares similarities with recent fixes for the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers' limits.\n\nThe current file context reveals that the `bell` function has several methods for handling different forms of input, including `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval`. These methods deal with various aspects of the Bell number computation, including polynomial and incomplete polynomial representations. Notably, the `eval` method currently returns the Bell number or its polynomial form based on the input. There is no explicit handling for the case where `n` is `S.Infinity` in the `eval` method of the `bell` function.\n\nIn contrast, the `fibonacci` function has a specific `eval` method that handles the case when `n` is `S.Infinity`, directly returning `S.Infinity`. This suggests a clear path for addressing the issue: modifying the `eval` method of the `bell` function to recognize and return `S.Infinity` when `n` is `S.Infinity`.\n\nThe new search results do not introduce new methods or functionalities to process Bell numbers' limits, but they reiterate the existing methods as presented in the file context. There are mentions of rewriting the `bell` function as a Sum, but this does not directly address the limit issue at hand.\n\nGiven the analysis, the steps to fix the reported issue involve:\n1. Identifying where and how to modify the `eval` method of the `bell` function to detect and return `S.Infinity` when `n` is `S.Infinity`.\n2. Making sure this change aligns with the existing structure and logic in the `bell` class, potentially following the pattern set in the `fibonacci` class.\n\nBased on this understanding, the relevant sections of the code to implement the fix are contained within the `bell.eval` method. No additional spans are needed beyond those already identified as context for the `bell` function.",
