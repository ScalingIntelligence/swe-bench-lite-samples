The issue specifies that the `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` should return infinity instead of `bell(oo)`. We start by analyzing if there's any specific handling for Bell numbers in the limit calculations within the provided search results. In the file `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, we see the `bell` class definition and its methods which compute the Bell numbers, but we don't find any specific code concerning the limit as `n` approaches infinity. In the file `sympy/series/limits.py`, we see the general structure for limit calculations, but no specific treatment for Bell numbers. Since there's no direct reference of Bell numbers within the limit functions, it suggests that there might be a need to modify or introduce code in the limit function to handle Bell numbers separately or check if certain mathematical properties of Bell numbers are appropriately considered in the general handling of limits.",

The `limit` function is located in `sympy/series/limits.py`, which is responsible for evaluating limits, including those involving combinatorial functions like Bell numbers. Given the issue description, the expectation is that the limit of Bell numbers as `n` approaches infinity should evaluate to infinity (`oo`), not return `bell(oo)` unevaluated. The file context includes the `bell` function, which is essential for representing Bell numbers, and the `limit` function with its heuristics and `doit` method, which are critical for evaluating limits. However, the specific logic for handling the limit of Bell numbers as `n` approaches infinity is not explicitly present in the provided context.
