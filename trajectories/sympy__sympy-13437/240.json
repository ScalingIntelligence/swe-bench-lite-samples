These methods handle the computation of Bell numbers in different scenarios.\n- The `limitinf` function in `sympy/series/gruntz.py`, which is responsible for calculating the limit of an expression as it approaches infinity. This might be where the issue occurs if the limit calculation is not correctly evaluating the expression involving `bell(n)`.\n\nThese code spans provide a good starting point to trace and potentially fix the issue, as they cover the core functionality related to both the Bell numbers and the limit calculation.\n",

From the provided file context, we can see that the `bell` function is defined in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and the `limit` function related logic is in `sympy/series/gruntz.py`. The `bell` function has a static method `_bell` that computes Bell numbers, and there is also a method `eval` that evaluates Bell numbers for integer inputs. The `limit` functionality, however, is not directly visible in the provided context, though it's referenced in `gruntz.py`. Given the nature of the issue (needing to handle the limit as n approaches infinity for Bell numbers), it seems pertinent to focus on extending the `eval` method of the `bell` class to handle the special case of `n` approaching infinity. The provided context does not include the exact code responsible for computing limits, but it hints at where such code might be located. Thus, although we don't have the exact relevant code snippet in the provided context to fix the issue, the context gives us enough information to suggest searching further in the `limit` related functions in `sympy/series/gruntz.py` for a complete solution.",

The search results from `sympy/series/gruntz.py` provide additional context related to the limit computation, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand. Specifically, the `limitinf` function and related utilities could be instrumental in implementing the correct behavior for `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` since they handle the computation of limits. Additionally, the `rewrite`, `sign`, `mrv`, and `gruntz` functions are all relevant as they provide tools for manipulating and evaluating expressions in the context of limits. The `mrv_max1` and `mrv_max3` functions are also included as they are used in the larger context of managing expression trees related to the dominant expressions (most rapidly varying functions) which would be key in handling limits of combinatorial functions like the Bell numbers. Based on this analysis, relevant code spans from both the current file context and the new search results should be included for a comprehensive understanding and potential fix for the issue.",

This issue could be related to the `limitinf` function in the gruntz module, which is responsible for calculating limits at infinity. The provided context includes the `bell` class and its methods in sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py, along with the gruntz algorithm functions in sympy/series/gruntz.py. New search results have shown additional functions in the gruntz module, providing more context for how the algorithm handles expressions involving special functions like the Bell function and limits at infinity.
