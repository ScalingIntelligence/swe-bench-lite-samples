This behavior is inconsistent with what has been fixed for similar functions like Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. The problem seems to be related to how the `bell` function is evaluated when `n` approaches infinity. Given the nature of the issue, I should focus the search on the `bell` class and its related methods, as well as the `limit` function and its implementations.",

This issue requires modifications in the SymPy codebase, specifically in the implementation of the Bell numbers and the limit function. The provided search results contain code spans related to the Bell numbers (`class bell`) and the limit function (`def limit`). These spans are relevant to the reported issue. The `bell` class definition includes the `eval` method which is responsible for the evaluation of Bell numbers. The `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` is responsible for calculating limits, and it uses heuristics to handle different scenarios. The identified spans are crucial to understanding and fixing the issue. By examining these code spans and understanding their role in the computation process, it is possible to identify where the modification is needed to ensure `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` correctly evaluates to `oo` rather than `bell(oo)`.",
