To address this, we need to identify the part of the code responsible for the limit calculation of the Bell function. From the provided search results, the relevant code spans are located in the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file, specifically within the `bell` class and its static methods that compute the Bell numbers and polynomials. Additionally, considering the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` is also potentially relevant as it handles limit calculations. Since the current implementation does not directly address the limit of Bell numbers as `n` approaches infinity, identifying these spans will help in understanding where the change should be made.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
