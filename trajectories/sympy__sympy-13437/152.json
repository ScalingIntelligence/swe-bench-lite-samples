The relevant files and functions are likely to be found in the files related to combinatorial numbers, particularly `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and the series or limit handling files such as `sympy/series/limits.py` and `sympy/series/gruntz.py`.",

This implies that there is an issue with how the limit function is handled for the Bell numbers. The search results provide several relevant code spans related to the Bell numbers and the limit function. The `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` contains several key methods such as `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, `eval`, and `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum`. These methods are directly related to the computation of Bell numbers. Additionally, the `Limit` class in `sympy/series/limits.py` is relevant because it contains the `doit` method which is responsible for calculating the limit. The `limit_seq` function in `sympy/series/limitseq.py` is also relevant as it deals with limits of sequences, which includes Bell numbers. These code spans provide a good starting point for understanding and potentially fixing the issue.",

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
