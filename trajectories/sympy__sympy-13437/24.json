            "scratch_pad": "The reported issue concerns the behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` in Sympy, which should yield `oo` (infinity) but currently returns `bell(oo)`. This issue involves understanding the implementation of the Bell numbers and their limits within the codebase.\n\n1. Analyzing the reported issue, the key requirement is to ensure that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` correctly evaluates to infinity rather than returning a placeholder for infinity. This requires examining how the Bell numbers are defined and how their limits are computed.\n\n2. Given the current context, no relevant code has been identified yet, which indicates that a thorough review of the new search results is necessary.\n\n3. The search results include several files and spans within them. The `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file contains the definition of the `bell` function, which is crucial for this issue since it deals with the Bell numbers.\n\n4. The `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py` file contains a class `TupleArg` with a `limit` method, which could potentially be relevant if `bell(n)` is handled within a tuple context. This file may offer insights into how general limit operations are handled within Sympy.\n\n5. The `sympy/matrices/matrices.py` file includes a `MatrixCalculus` class with a `limit` method. Although this might not be directly related to the Bell numbers, it shows how Sympy handles limits in a matrix context.\n\n6. The `sympy/core/expr.py` file contains the `Expr` class, which includes a `limit` method. This class is fundamental as it deals with expressions in Sympy, including potentially complex symbolic expressions.\n\n7. The `sympy/series/limits.py` file contains the `limit` function, which is the main entry point for computing limits in Sympy. This is essential to understand how limits are generally computed and potentially modified for the Bell numbers.\n\nGiven the relevance of the `bell` function's definition and the broader context of how limits are computed in Sympy, the identified spans are crucial for understanding the current behavior and for potential modifications to address the reported issue. The relevant code spans are those centered around the `bell` function and the general expression limit handling.",
