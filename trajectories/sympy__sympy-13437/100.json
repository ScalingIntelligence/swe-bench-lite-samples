This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the context of the Bell numbers representing the number of partitions of a set. Given the nature of the issue, it is likely to be found within the `numbers.py` or `expr.py` files, where core functions like `limit` and `Infinity` are defined. Alternatively, it could be in the `combinatorial/numbers.py` file where the `bell` function is defined. The search should focus on these areas to find the code responsible for the limit evaluation and the handling of the `bell(n)` function.",

This discrepancy needs to be addressed in the implementation of the `bell` class and the `limit` method in the SymPy library.\n\nFrom the search results, the `bell` class is located in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`, and it includes methods such as `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval`. These methods are responsible for computing Bell numbers and Bell polynomials, but they do not directly address the limit behavior.\n\nThe `limit` method is defined in `sympy/core/expr.py` under the `Expr` class. This method is crucial for addressing the limit issue mentioned in the reported issue. It calls the `limit` function from `sympy.series.limits` to compute the limit of an expression. To resolve the issue, modifications would likely be needed in both the `bell` class to handle the limit computation properly and in the `limit` method of `Expr` class to correctly process the limit of Bell numbers as `n` approaches infinity.\n\nIt's also important to consider the `Infinity` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, which includes methods dealing with infinity (`oo`). This class might not need direct modification but is relevant context for understanding how infinity is handled in SymPy.\n\nOverall, the relevant code spans involve the `bell` class for the definition and computation of Bell numbers and the `limit` method in the `Expr` class for the limit computation. These areas need careful examination and potential modification to ensure that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` correctly evaluates to `oo`.",

From the file context, the `bell` class and its methods have been already identified. Now, examining the new search results: The `bell` class is again found with methods `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, `eval`, and a new method `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum`. These are relevant for understanding the Bell number computation and how it might relate to the limit function. Additionally, `sympy/series/limits.py` contains the `limit` function and related heuristics, which is crucial for understanding how limits are computed in SymPy.

The `bell` class and its methods are directly related to the Bell numbers, and the `limit` function and its associated methods in `limits.py` handle the limit calculations. The current implementation of `Limit.doit` in `limits.py` does not handle the specific case of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` properly, leading to the undesired output.

As the Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, it seems natural that `bell(oo)` should be able to be evaluated rather than be returned unevaluated. This issue is also in line with the recent fixes to the corresponding limit for the Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers.\n\n```\nfrom sympy import *\nn = symbols('n')\nbell(n).limit(n,oo)\n\nOutput:\nbell(oo)\n```\n\nI'm new to Sympy, so I'd appreciate the opportunity to fix this bug myself if that's alright.\n\n"
