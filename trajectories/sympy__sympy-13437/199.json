The current output `bell(oo)` is not as expected; instead, the result should be `oo`. The issue is related to the limit computation of the Bell number function as `n` approaches infinity. Given the current context, the relevant code spans involve the `bell` class and its methods in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` as well as the limit computation functions in `sympy/series/limits.py`. Further analysis of the new search results reveals additional context and methods related to limit computations in different modules, which may also be relevant to understand the problem fully. Specifically, the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` and the limit-related functions in `sympy/core/expr.py`, `sympy/series/limits.py`, and `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py` are identified as critical for addressing the reported issue. The `limit` method in `sympy/core/expr.py`, the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, and the `limit` method in `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py` all make use of Sympy's limit computation logic, which is directly involved in the issue. Additionally, the `MatrixCalculus.limit` method in `sympy/matrices/matrices.py` is irrelevant to this issue as it pertains to matrix calculus, not combinatorial numbers or general limit computations applicable to the bell function.",
