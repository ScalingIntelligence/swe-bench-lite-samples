This requires understanding how the Bell number function `bell(n)` is defined and how the limit function `limit(e, z, z0, dir='+')` works in SymPy. Additionally, it's important to check the existing implementation of the limit function for Bell numbers and see if it correctly handles the transition to infinity. The provided files show relevant classes and methods in SymPy that might be related to this issue. Specifically, `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` contains the class `bell` which might need modification for the limit to infinity. `sympy/series/limits.py` contains the method for calculating limits, which is essential for understanding how the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity is currently being handled.",

To address this issue, we need to find the relevant code that handles the `bell` function and its limit behavior. The search results contain several code spans related to the `bell` function, including its definition, evaluation, and rewrites as sums. Specifically, the span with the ID 'bell.eval' contains the `eval` method for the `bell` class, which is crucial for understanding how the function behaves with integer inputs. Additionally, the span with the ID 'bell._eval_rewrite_as_Sum' shows how the function can be rewritten as a sum, which might be relevant for understanding its limit behavior.

The `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` method might be a starting point for handling this, but additional code will likely be needed in the `bell` class or in a related limit calculation module to properly handle this case. The `sympy/series/limits.py` file, which contains the method for calculating limits, should also be examined for potential integration or modification.

The issue at hand involves the behavior of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`, with the expectation that it should return infinity (`oo`), not Bell(oo). To address this, we need to delve into how limits are evaluated in SymPy, particularly focusing on the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py`, which already handles a variety of limits. Since the Bell numbers have a combinatorial definition, it might be necessary to explicitly handle the limit for Bell numbers in the `limit` function or improve the evaluation logic within the `bell` class for large values of `n`.

This suggests that the `eval` method for `bell` should handle the case when `n` is `oo`, similar to how `fibonacci` and `lucas` handle it. 2. From the provided code context and search results, we see that `bell(n)` is defined in the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file. 3. Relevant spans of the code include `bell` class definition and its `eval` method, which currently does not handle the case for `n` being `oo`. 4. Comparing with the `fibonacci` and `lucas` classes, which have special handling for `n` as `oo`, it is clear that the `bell` class should be updated similarly. 5.

This issue is analogous to recent fixes for the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. To address this, we need to review the `bell` class and its methods, particularly the `eval` and `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` methods, to understand how limits are handled for Bell numbers. The provided search results and file context contain relevant code spans for the `bell` class. Specifically, the `bell.eval` method needs to be checked to ensure that if `n` is infinity, the return value is infinity rather than an unevaluated `bell(oo)`. Additionally, the `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` method should be reviewed to ensure it does not interfere with the limit evaluation process. The `fibonacci.eval` method provides a useful reference for how to handle limits for a sequence that should approach infinity.",
