This issue seems to be related to how the limit of the Bell numbers is being evaluated. It's likely that the `bell` function in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` needs to be adjusted to handle the limit correctly, possibly in a similar manner to how it's done for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. Additionally, the `limitinf` function in `sympy/series/gruntz.py` and the `limit` function in `sympy/series/limits.py` might also be involved in the process of evaluating this limit.",

This implies that the function related to the Bell numbers should be evaluated correctly in the limit. The search results provided contain several sections of code related to the Bell numbers and their evaluation, particularly in the `bell` class within `numbers.py`. Additionally, there are sections of code related to handling limits and comparisons in `gruntz.py` and `limits.py`. Given the issue, the relevant sections to focus on are those that handle the evaluation of the Bell numbers and the sections that deal with taking limits in `gruntz.py`. The `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, `_bell_incomplete_poly`, and `eval` methods in the `bell` class seem most directly related to evaluating the Bell numbers. The `limitinf` and `rewrite` functions in `gruntz.py` also appear relevant as they deal with taking limits. These sections should be considered to determine if the current implementation aligns with the expected behavior for the limit of Bell numbers as n approaches infinity.",

The file context provided includes the `bell` class definition in 'sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py' which seems to be directly relevant to the reported issue. The class contains methods for handling different forms of Bell numbers (like `_bell`, `_bell_poly`, and `_bell_incomplete_poly`). However, the specific `eval` method does not currently handle the limit process with 'oo' explicitly. This lack might be the point of failure for `bell(n).limit(n, oo)`. The issue also suggests that modifications might be needed in how limits are computed, referencing 'sympy/series/gruntz.py' which contains limit computation logic but no direct handling for Bell numbers. Given this information, although relevant code for Bell numbers is present, specific limit handling code is not entirely detailed. Therefore, it's unclear if the existing code alone would resolve the limit issue without additional modifications or understanding of limit-handling logic across the entire codebase.",

However, the Bell class is present and outlines the basic structure for Bell number and polynomial computations, suggesting that the relevant code could eventually be adjusted in the Bell class. Further examination of how limits are generally handled in other parts of the codebase (like in `sympy/series/gruntz.py`) indicates a need to potentially integrate or modify such limit functions to work correctly for the Bell class. Therefore, while the relevant class is identified, specific limit handling logic is not yet identified.",

However, the `fibonacci` class provides an example where the limit to infinity is explicitly handled by returning `S.Infinity`.

For instance, the `bell` class in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` does not currently have explicit logic for handling the infinity limit (`eval` method does not treat `n is S.Infinity`). However, the `fibonacci` class provides an example where the limit to infinity is explicitly handled by returning `S.Infinity`. This suggests that the `bell` class may need to incorporate similar logic to correctly evaluate `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` to `oo`. Additionally, the `limitinf` function in `sympy/series/gruntz.py` plays a crucial role in evaluating limits towards infinity, and understanding its mechanism could guide improvements in how Bell numbers handle their limits.",
