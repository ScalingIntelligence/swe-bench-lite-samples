This suggests that the limit function in the context of the Bell numbers needs to be inspected. Given the issue's nature, it's crucial to focus on the `limit` function and the `bell` function within Sympy's combinatorial functions module, as well as how the limit is being evaluated in the series module. Additionally, understanding the integration of these functions with the core number and expression handling might be necessary for a comprehensive fix.",

The user reports that `bell(n).limit(n,oo)` currently returns `bell(oo)` instead of the expected infinity. This suggests issues in the handling of the Bell numbers when evaluating limits to infinity.\n\n1. **SymPy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py**:\n   - The entire `bell` class and its methods need to be reviewed to understand how Bell numbers are computed and how they might interact with limits.\n   - Specifically, the `eval` method and the logic for handling integer values of 'n' should be checked. This method could be responsible for the actual evaluation of Bell numbers.\n   - The `_bell` and `_bell_poly` methods provide the basic computation mechanisms for Bell numbers and could potentially be central to finding a solution.\n   - The `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` method rewrites the Bell function as a sum, which could be relevant for limit computations.\n\n2. **SymPy/series/limits.py**:\n   - The `limit` function and the `Limit.doit` method are crucial for understanding how the limit operation is performed in SymPy.\n   - The `heuristics` function provides mechanisms that are used to simplify or compute limits, which might affect how Bell numbers are treated.\n   - It's important to see if there are any specific checks or behaviors that would influence the handling of a function like `bell(n)` when considering limits.\n\nBy analyzing these sections of code, especially the interaction between the bell function in `numbers.py` and the limit computation routines in `limits.py`, we should be able to pinpoint the areas where a fix might need to be applied to resolve the reported issue where `bell(n).limit(n,oo)` does not return infinity as expected.",

The current output from the `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` function is `bell(oo)`, which is incorrect as per the user's report. The user intends to fix this bug. To address this, we need to identify the relevant code spans where the `bell` function and its limit handling are defined.\n\n1. The `bell` class is found in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`.\n2. We focus on the `bell.eval` method which checks if `n` is an integer and non-negative, and then evaluates the Bell number or polynomial accordingly. This method does not handle the case where `n` is `S.Infinity`. We also need to check the `bell._eval_rewrite_as_Sum` method, which might handle limits indirectly, but it does not explicitly handle `n` as `S.Infinity`.\n3. In `sympy/series/limits.py`, the `limit` function and `Limit` class handle generic limit calculations. The `bell` function is not directly referenced here, but this file contains generic limit calculation logic that could be used to handle the limit of `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity.\n4. Other combinatorial functions like `fibonacci` and `lucas` have `eval` methods that correctly handle `n` as `S.Infinity`. This serves as a useful reference for how to address the issue with the `bell` function.\n\nGiven this context, the relevant code spans are in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` within the `bell.eval` method. We should update this method to handle `n` being `S.Infinity` and return `S.Infinity` directly, similar to how `fibonacci` and `lucas` do. Additionally, understanding the behavior of the `limit` function and `Limit` class in `sympy/series/limits.py` is helpful as it provides context for handling limits in SymPy generally.",
