This file contains the implementation of the `limit` function and related heuristics and methods for handling various mathematical limits. The specific span labeled 'heuristics' appears particularly relevant as it contains logic for handling limits in special cases. Notably, it checks for the type of limit being calculated, which could correctly identify and handle the limit of Bell numbers as infinity. Additionally, the 'limit' span itself reveals the central function for calculating limits, which may need to be adjusted to correctly handle Bell number limits in comparison to other number sequences that have been fixed. Although more specific handling for Bell numbers isn't directly found in the provided spans, understanding and possibly adapting the logic within 'heuristics' or modifying the `Limit` class or `limit` function itself might be the solution path for addressing the issue.",

To address this, it's important to understand how the `bell` function and its limits are currently handled in the codebase. First, I reviewed the existing file context in `sympy/series/limits.py`, focusing on the `limit` function and its heuristics to see how other functions like Fibonacci are handled for limits. The `heuristics` function handles limits by breaking down the expression into its components and evaluating each individually, which could be a good approach for `bell` as well. In the new search results, I found the `bell` function definition in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` which includes its static methods for calculating Bell numbers and polynomials. The `bell.eval` method evaluates the Bell number for integer `n`, and the `_eval_rewrite_as_Sum` method rewrites the Bell number as a Sum, which could potentially help in handling the limit calculation for `bell(n)` as `n` approaches infinity. The current implementation of limits doesn't specifically handle `bell` numbers, so this new understanding can guide in extending the limit handling to include `bell` numbers correctly, perhaps by leveraging the Sum representation or by defining a specific case in the heuristics for Bell numbers.",
